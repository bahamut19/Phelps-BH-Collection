{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"=== START BH00663 ===\n\nHe is God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise\n\nO Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the True King, the Manifest Justice! This is the Day wherein are witnessed from the Most Great Sea waves the like of which no eye hath ever beheld, and from the Sun lights the like of which have never appeared. Blessed is the eye that hath witnessed and seen, and the ear that hath heard the rushing of the winds of My loving-kindness, and the rustling of My Lote-Tree, and the scratching of My Pen as it moveth by My command and power, and I am the Ancient Commander.\n\nThat which thou didst send hath reached Our presence. We have read it and answered it, that his eyes may be solaced and his heart assured through the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO Muhammad-Baqir! We have heard thy call and witnessed thy turning unto Us and read thy letter which thou didst send to him who is with Me. We have mentioned thee with a mention one letter of which surpasseth all that the servants glory in, as attesteth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. And thy letter which thou didst previously send to the servant who is present before the Face hath reached the Wronged One. Verily thy Lord is the All-Reckoning, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the tongue that hath confessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered, and the heart that hath been adorned with the love of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Is?aq, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, that he may rejoice and be of those who render thanks. O Is?aq! The Lord of the Day of the Covenant maketh mention of thee at the time of His Pen's movement, and His heart grieveth for what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We have raised up the Cause through a power from Us and a might from Our presence. When the Sun of Manifestation shone forth to a determined degree, the wolves emerged from behind the veil and uttered that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. Blessed art thou for having turned unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Be thou steadfast in His Cause and firm in His love and upright in such wise that the doubts of the heedless shall not cause thee to slip. The Wronged One mentioneth thee and beseecheth God, thy Lord, to aid thee in His remembrance and praise and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His unified servants.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who was named Rama?an-'Ali who desired to be remembered from 'Amman through the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Generous. Blessed is the servant who is mentioned before the Face; he is indeed among those who are nigh in My Great Tablet. We beseech God to aid him to preserve what he hath been given from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! I am he who hath turned unto the horizon of Thy Manifestation, and the ocean of Thy utterance, and the sun of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me through Thy generosity and grace, and to ordain for me that which shall deliver me from the promptings of Satan and preserve me through Thy grace. Then ordain for me the good of the hereafter and the present world. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nHearken unto the divine utterance in the Persian tongue: Today the ocean hath different waves, the sun a different effulgence, and the world a different joy. Although the Wronged One dwelleth in prison and is afflicted in the hands of enemies, yet with utmost joy He is established upon the throne of manifestation, calling out to His loved ones with a call for which there is no end and which shall remain raised throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Although the people of the Bayan have committed that which the people of the Furqan (Muslims) did not, and have said that which that party did not say, yet by the life of God, this party is seen to be more base than the former party. The verses are being sent down like rain falling in torrents, and the evidences are manifest and clear. Nevertheless, they remain occupied with their own vain imaginings and are striving earnestly to establish a party like the party of old. We beseech the True One to aid the people of Baha in such wise that they may see all else as non-existent, remain focused on the Most Exalted Horizon, and arise with mighty legs to uphold the divine Cause, lest they be made to slip by the doubts of the deluded ones and the gestures of the opposers.\n\nAs regards what was written concerning Muhammad-Baqir, who entertained the friends at a feast - well done, excellent indeed! We beseech God to assist him in fostering love and unity amongst His loved ones, and to ordain for him, through His grace and bounty, whatsoever is worthy of His generosity. We make mention of all the souls gathered at that feast, that they may attain the effects of the Pen and the remembrance of the Ancient King.\n\nO Zaynu'l-'Abidin! We have made mention of thee on this day, once again, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.\n\nO Siyyid Barakat! Hearken unto the call of Him Who revealeth the verses and manifesteth the clear tokens. He hath remembered thee with a remembrance from which hath flowed the Kawthar of life unto all creation, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Verily, the Wronged One, in His prison, maketh mention of the friends and loved ones of God, beareth unto them glad-tidings of His mercy, remindeth them of His verses, and sendeth down for them that which shall guide them unto His straight path. By God's life! I have desired naught for Myself. Throughout My days, I have been in the hands of Mine enemies - every truthful and trustworthy one beareth witness to this. Such tribulations have befallen Me in God's path as have befallen no one else, until they made Us captives and brought Us to this mighty fortress. Therein was the trumpet-blast sounded once again, and We delivered unto kings and subjects that which We were commanded by God, the Strong, the Powerful. The veils of the people have not hindered Us, nor have We been daunted by the oppression of the oppressors. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My utterance and My wondrous remembrance.\n\nO Muhammad-Baqir! We testify that thou hast performed a good deed, and thy deed hath brought joy to the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. We made mention of thee before, and We mention thee now, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. We beseech God to assist thee in performing good deeds and to aid thee in drawing nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO 'Abdu'llah! When thou hearest My call and art seized with the wine of the Kawthar of My utterance, say: \"My God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having caused me to turn towards Thy horizon, to set my face toward the lights of Thy countenance, and to acknowledge that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being, by Thy most great signs and Thy mighty tokens, to make me steadfast in preserving that which Thou hast given me through Thy bounty and generosity. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Praised.\"\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who is named Ramadan-'Ali, whom We have remembered on this day once again, that he may be numbered among the thankful ones. When thou art attracted by the Kawthar of My utterance and awakened by the breezes of the dawn of My Revelation, arise and say: \"My God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having shown me Thy path and caused me to hear Thy proof. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Announcement and Thy Straight Path to ordain for me that which shall protect me from the oppression of the oppressors and the cawing of the croakers who have broken Thy covenant and Thy testament and have disbelieved in Thy signs. Verily, Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nO Mahmud! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed. Sing in My name upon the branches of the Tree of My love, that perchance by thy call every heedless one may turn, every sleeping one may arise, and every ignorant and doubtful one may become aware. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One in His manifest station.\n\nO Amanullah! The protection hath come, yet the people understand not; and the proof hath appeared, yet mankind perceive not. The verses have been sent down, yet the factions turn away therefrom. The path hath been made manifest, yet the people know it not. The trumpet hath been sounded, yet they hear not; and the cry hath been raised, yet they comprehend not. They have cast behind them that which is with God, clinging to that which they possess. Verily, they are accounted among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is he who heareth, whom the doubts of the people have not deterred, and blessed is he who seeth, whom the veils of the suspicious have not hindered.\n\nO Pen! Mention him who is named Muhammad-Baqir at the end of the Tablet, as a favor from Thee - verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ancient. We testify that he hath turned unto Thee and hath attained unto Thy days, and hath inhaled the fragrance of Thy utterance, while most of the servants turned away. Thus doth God exalt whom He willeth and abase whom He desireth. He is verily the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nAnd We make mention of Our loved ones who have gathered once again, that the remembrance and utterance may draw them nigh unto the horizon of the All-Merciful and cause them to speak before all faces. The Desired One hath come with manifest sovereignty. O My loved ones! There hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen the equivalent of what was revealed unto the company of the chosen ones and the Prophets, yet the people remain behind a thick veil. When ye hear My sweetest call, take ye the chalices of bounty in the name of the Lord of Names, then drink therefrom the Kawthar of divine knowledge, in defiance of the people of creation who have broken God's covenant, denied His proof, and disputed His verses. Thus doth the Wronged One command you from the precincts of the prison. Verily, He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Abandon what the people possess, clinging fast to the cord of God, the Sure. When a cawer cometh unto you, leave him to himself, turning with your hearts unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus have We counseled you before, and in this hour, as a mercy from Us. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those who, when they heard, responded and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics!\"\n\n=== END BH00663 ===\n\n=== START BH00664 ===\n\nThe beloved and exalted, His Holiness the Name 66 \\[Allah\\] Z, may all 9 \\[Baha\\] of His Most Glorious be upon him, will observe:\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power\n\nThe ocean of praise and thanksgiving befitteth and beseemeth the Lord of all names, Who bestowed existence upon the world and adorned it with the ornament of nations. He is the Omnipotent One Whose power no weakness can touch and Whose will no creation can hinder. And blessings and peace be upon Him Whom He sent forth and unto Whom He revealed His Book, and adorned Him with His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes, Who was named Muhammad in the world of creation, and upon His family and companions through whom the earth brought forth its fruits and the heaven shed its rain.\n\nAnd furthermore, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your honor. Your letters from before and after have been received. In truth, they were a paradise reflecting praise and thanksgiving, and speaking of that which indicateth the Most Great Steadfastness. The servant hath found therein what the body findeth in the spirit, and what the niche findeth in the light. When I read and understood, I turned to the Station and presented it before His Countenance. The Lord - may my spirit be sacrificed for Him - spoke: \"We beseech God to assist him through remembrance and to strengthen him through utterance in such wise that His light, His influence and His proof may be made manifest throughout all possibility. The Command is in God's hands, the Lord of all religions. O Zein! Upon thee be My peace and My glory, and upon My loved ones there. We counsel them in all conditions to that whereby the Cause of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, may be uplifted, and to draw nigh unto the Divine Lote-Tree and to turn with heart and soul toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Say: O My loved ones! We command you to that which will profit you in every world of the worlds of your Lord, and to righteousness and fear of God, and to turn away from those who have denied God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.\" In all conditions they must fix their gaze upon the Truth, utter His praise and remembrance, and turn away from all else. This is the command of the Wronged One, before and after. The purpose of turning away is to avoid association, not contention and conflict, and this applies to those souls who have arisen in opposition and objection and who have manifested rancor and hatred. These souls are known, and most are aware of their condition. O Zein! We beseech God to enable all to attain true unity and to grant them a portion from the ocean of the word \"There is none other God but Him,\" and not to deprive His servants of His boundless grace.\n\nMr. Muhammad Ibrahim and Haji Ghulam-'Ali, along with two others - upon them be the peace and favors of God - arrived intending to visit the House, and praise be to God, they attained the Most Great Pilgrimage. This year was very pleasant for the pilgrims. In truth it was a blessed journey. Blessed are they who have attained. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant success to all the peoples of the earth that all may attain. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nAnother matter: As some funds were needed, twenty tumans were borrowed from the spiritual friend Mr. Muhammad Ibrahim - upon him be the peace of God - which your honor should convey to him. Although at first he was unwilling to accept it, they specifically stated it must reach him and he accepted. Your honor must pay it. And what the friends brought of gaz and other items was received.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the traveling companion, it is necessary, and Mr. Habibullah is permitted to be in your honor's service, but they said after meeting he must return, as wisdom requires this.\n\nAnother submission concerns the sum due to Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be God's peace. Its delay is in no way permissible. Indeed, they have performed a good deed and this act has been accepted. Let it be delivered to him. The souls mentioned who have turned to God with certitude, upon them be God's peace, from among the people of S, H-M, N-R, Shah-Abad, B-R and T who have sought mention from that Presence - all have been honored with mention, one and all. He said: \"O Zayn, convey greetings to all these souls on behalf of the Wronged One, and counsel them regarding that which remains of their remembrances. This Wronged One has ever beseeched on behalf of all that which is like unto a lamp before their faces in all the worlds of God, exalted be His glory. We have counseled and continue to counsel all to unity, harmony, kindness, love and steadfastness, which are among the greatest of deeds. O Zayn, beseech God to protect His servants and deprive none from the ocean of recognition, the sun of certitude and the heaven of knowledge. Verily, He speaks the truth and guides the way, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\"\n\nAnd likewise convey greetings to the handmaidens of God. We beseech God to assist them all and ordain for each one the good of this world and the next. We make mention of the people of Marfu' and console them, and we beseech God for the improvement of affairs.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveys greetings to each one and seeks divine success and confirmation for each. All must, at all times, with patience, calm and dignity, be engaged in the mention and praise of the Goal of all the worlds. Assuredly the outpourings of the True Bestower will embrace pure and holy souls and illumined hearts. Should hardship befall some, or difficulties arise, this has been and is due to God's penetrating wisdom, exalted be His glory. Blessed are the friends and loved ones of God - theirs is a goodly return. The end of all things is good, for the ocean of generosity is surging through His name and the sun of bounty exists through His favor. He will never deprive His loved ones. Every person of insight bears witness to this truth. Glad tidings that He said: \"If God willing, We shall thereafter summon the people there one by one that they may attain and return.\"\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Hasan (the Tailor), upon him be God's peace, when it was submitted, He said: \"O Zayn, write to Hasan: O Hasan! Your lamentations have been heard and the yearnings of your heart have reached Us. The Wronged One hears your cries and supplications. You have always been and continue to be remembered. For years you have been engaged in service. We beseech God to grant souls fairness that they may not say that which they have not heard from the tongue of the Wronged One. Truthfulness has ever been and remains the characteristic of the people of truth. One must not be content with imaginings and conjectures. Say: O Hasan! Be not grieved. By the life of God, your grief has grieved Me. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to adorn you with the ornament of patience and forbearance, and His servants with justice and fairness.\"\n\nThis servant also conveys greetings to him. God is witness and testifier that he is remembered most of the time, and all who circle \\[the Sacred Precinct\\] mention him with utmost love, kindness and care, and send their greetings. It is hoped that something may be written directly to him hereafter, as in these days the spiritual beloved Aqa Mulla Rida - he who spoke the truth before all faces - and he have written and sent letters. Repeatedly there has arrived from them that from which the fragrance of love and sincerity emanates.\n\nAt the end of the manuscript, when mention was made of His Holiness the Name 66 \\[Allah\\] al-Asdaq, upon him be from every 9 \\[Baha\\] its Most Glorious, before His presence, He said: \"Upon him be God's peace, His care, His mercy, and His grace, and upon his son, and upon those whom God has related to him.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant conveys greetings to each of the friends in that land. He Himself is witness and testifier that their mention has ever been the cause of joy and their remembrance the source of delight, and this is naught but through the bounty of the Lord, for they have borne hardships in His path and have tasted the poison of hatred in their love for Him. We beseech God to grant success to all and to confirm them in preserving what has been bestowed. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon your honor, upon them, and upon every steadfast, firm and upright one. And praise be to God, the Exalted, the Great.\n\nThe Servant\n\n26th of the month of Safar al-Khayr 1303\n\n=== END BH00664 ===\n\n=== START BH00665 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise be unto the Self-Subsisting Lord Who, after the Qa'im, arose with such arising as prevented all from arising, inasmuch as through the power of the Divine Word the foot of learning became unsteady and disturbed. Finding itself powerless to arise, it sat down - a sitting from which it hath not arisen to this day, as those possessed of vision among the divines and doctors of law have witnessed. When the Sun of Truth shed its radiance and the waves of the ocean of knowledge became manifest, these souls were seized with trembling and encompassed with perturbation, to such extent that the thread of their reason was severed and the bird of their faith took flight. The fire of hatred so encompassed them that it consumed their corrupt deeds.\n\nWhat a blessed fire it was and what a blessed deed!\n\nPraise be to its hand and to its mighty arm!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of existence, Who art established upon the Throne of the visible realm! Thou hearest the sighs of the sincere ones and beholdest the tears of them that are nigh unto Thee, by reason of what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the people of the Bayan who have turned away from Thy proof and Thy testimony, and from Thy signs in which they claimed to believe through Thy Manifestation aforetime - although they who are endowed with vision behold how all the books of the world bow down before a word that hath proceeded from the mouth of Thy will in this Revelation whereby the cities of Thy knowledge and the gardens of Thy Cause have been adorned. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Manifestation of Names, by Thy dominion and Thy might, and by the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge, to protect Thy loved ones from the cawing of the cawers and the turning away of them that turn aside. Then send down, O my God, upon Thy friends a blessing from Thy presence, and ordain for them in every world of Thy worlds such good as shall profit Thy servants. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Amin, O Abu'l-Hassan! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of the hidden and the manifest! Thy letter was presented, thy call was heard. Today a tongue hath appeared in all things and all utter the blessed words \"Aid us then, O God of all worlds, against the people of tyranny.\" O Amin! Today the verses of God are cast upon all and pass before all, yet all are heedless save whom God willeth. Beseech God not to deprive His servants of the wine of His bounty. We have spoken with the tongue, with the finger have We rent asunder the veils, and by Our will have We made manifest the mysteries of the divine Books. Nevertheless, they are deaf, dumb, blind, and they neither understand, nor know, nor perceive.\n\nAs to what thou didst write regarding attendance, it hath been some time since departure. Were thou to return to thy Source, it would be better for thee. In Arabic: \"Come! Come!\" In Persian: \"Come! Come!\" That thou mayest behold Him for Whose vision eyes were created. Come! Come! That thou mayest hear that for whose hearing ears were formed. Today the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree is ablaze and the light of the Divine Countenance is manifest and radiant. Blessed is the soul that hath been set aflame by its heat and illumined by its light.\n\nThe people have not known nor do they know the value of this Day. Ere long shall they utter the words \"Oh, woe unto us!\" With their own idle fancies and vain imaginings have they objected to the Truth. Such is the state of the heedless and the negligent. These souls are of those who for twelve hundred years cried out \"O Lord!\" and \"O Vicegerent!\" and \"O Ali!\" and \"O Sheikh!\", yet when at last He appeared for Whose appearance they had waited all this time, and through Whose utterance those very names were created, they occupied themselves with cursing and reviling Him from their pulpits. Then all the divines of Persia issued the decree for the shedding of His blood, and their followers - well known is what they said and did. By God! The Eye of Grandeur weepeth and the Point of Being lamenteth. Say: O servants! Reflect a little upon the deeds of those souls and upon their result and fruit. By the life of God! They are in manifest error and are among the most lost in the mighty Book.\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Divine Countenance! The Most Exalted Pen hath repeatedly recorded these passages that the evil deeds of the former party might become evident and manifest to all, for it is observed that the heedless barking ones prevent the people through their former delusions and deprive them from the path of God. Would that eyes and ears could be found, that the veil might be wholly lifted and the reality of the Cause might become manifest and evident to all the worlds. The people are weak, and the mercy of God, exalted be His glory, hath preceded; therefore words are spoken in measure. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what will be. Verily, we are God's and to Him shall we return.\n\nPraise be to God! The rays of the Sun of Truth have illumined the realm of the hearts of the chosen ones. At all times the waters of mercy flow, verses are revealed, and clear proofs are made manifest. This spiritual friend and this servant must implore from the Sea of Divine Generosity, exalted be His glory, to awaken the heedless people and grant them vision. He is the Protector and the Powerful, He is the All-Knowing and the Omnipotent.\n\nThe greatest glad tidings is the presence of that spiritual friend in the holy court of the Lord. I beseech and hope from God that He may soon grant the blessing of attainment unto His presence. I also beseech Him to favor the beloved of my heart, namely His Holiness the Afnan, the honored Alif and Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and bestow upon him from the ocean of attainment and the fountain of reunion. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nGod is my witness that for a long time I have made and continue to make this supplication with both my outer and inner tongue, for this bounty has no likeness and this deed no parallel. The Command is in His hands; He does what He wills and ordains what He pleases. He shall not be asked of His doings and He is knowing of all things.\n\nAnother matter: The papers that were requested have been sent, as before. Outwardly, there is no news except that some time ago the Two Shining Lights, the two most noble Branches, His Holiness Aqa Aqa Mirza Diya'u'llah and His Holiness Aqa Aqa Mirza Badi'u'llah - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto their arrival - and the people of the pavilion of chastity, virtue and greatness have proceeded to Beirut. In truth, this year the place of that spiritual friend was empty. Would that all were present and could witness with their own eyes the effulgences of the rays of the Sun of Divine Grace. Although they were not physically present, they were and are mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court.\n\nConvey greetings and salutations on my behalf to the friends in the cities and regions. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm them in such wise that they may regard all else save God as non-existent and evanescent, and that they may attain unto the lights of true unity. This Day is not like the days of the past; this ocean has different waters and this heaven a different sun. Repeatedly was this exalted word heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - blessed and exalted be His utterance: \"O people of God! Until you pass beyond the gulf of names, you will not attain unto the ocean of inner meanings.\" If a soul is confirmed in hearkening unto this one word, there has not been and is not any danger for him. All atoms bear witness to his faith, certitude and steadfastness in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. A hundred thousand blessings upon the soul who has drunk from this cup and partaken of this chalice.\n\nGlory, praise and magnification be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Great. And praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Servant\n\n28th of Dhi'l-Hajjih 1302\n\n=== END BH00665 ===\n\n=== START BH00666 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to the Lord of all desires, the Sovereign of the unseen and seen realms, the Manifestation of names and attributes, Who with one exalted Word adorned absolute nothingness with the ornament of existence, and through it illumined the visible and invisible cities with the light of vision and knowledge. Exalted be His glory and His power, and exalted be His light and radiance! Light, radiance, remembrance and glory be upon those who have arisen to aid His Cause and uphold His commandments and laws, whose feet have not slipped through the doubts of the people nor the intimations of the idol-worshippers. They heard and turned to Him; they recognized and spoke, until they arose to serve His Cause, the Impregnable, the Inaccessible, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The words and utterances which bore the sweet fragrances of love and unity have arrived - the arrival of an ocean of praise and remembrance for one who is truly thirsty and spiritually athirst. After their arrival, perusal and contemplation, such a state of joy was attained that pen and ink fail to describe it, for from each word thereof wafted the fragrance of the love of the Desired One of all worlds. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you for that which hath flowed from the fountain of your love, the river of your knowledge. We beseech God to assist you and draw you nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And after the manifestation of joy and gladness, having aimed for the supreme heights and most exalted horizon, and after complete permission was granted, the verses and prose which flowed from the pen and ink of love and affection were presented. This is what the Lord of all men hath spoken in reply - exalted be His utterance and magnificent His proof, and there is no Beloved besides Him.\n\nHe is the Speaking One, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The people of that house and station have ever been present before the countenance of the Lord of all men and have been remembered with most wondrous praise. The honored and exalted Ha-Qabli-Sin, who hath ascended unto the Most Sublime Horizon, was blessed with special favors, and We revealed for him, before and after his ascension, that which brought solace to eyes and manifested mysteries. We testify that he arose to serve the Cause with such power as was not weakened by the affairs of men, and drank the nectar of immortality from the hands of bounty with such steadfastness as was not shaken by the conditions of the divines nor the might of princes nor the clamor of every remote barking dog. We testify that he attained unto that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. He hearkened when the Call was raised, hastened and said: \"Yea, yea, O Thou Goal of the hearts of them that know! Here am I, here am I, O Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\" Thus did the Lord of existence manifest His grace and mercy that hath preceded all things. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having aided thee to turn unto Him and for having revealed unto thee in the Most Great Prison that whereby the Tree was transformed into Fire and cried out, saying: \"O concourse of earth and heaven! The Lord of all creation hath come with sovereignty encompassing the unseen and the seen, and with a Cause before which all the armies of the world are powerless.\" To this doth the Most Great Name bear witness in this mighty, exalted Station. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of thy remembrance of this Most Great Announcement, whereby the hearts of the sincere were set ablaze. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth, and thy pen for having manifested before the face of the Lord of Names, in this exalted station, the pearls of remembrance and praise. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to strengthen thee through His sovereignty and to assist thee through His power, and to record for thee, with the Pen of His grace and the ink of His bounty, the reward of attaining His presence. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nWe wish to make mention of My leaf and My handmaiden who hath turned unto and believed in God, the Mighty, the Wise. O My leaf! Hearken unto My call from this Spot which God hath made the point round which circle them that are nigh unto Him and them that believe in His unity. We have mentioned thee aforetime in verses that shall neither be effaced nor altered throughout centuries and ages, and God hath made them to endure in His perspicuous Book. Rejoice thou in these glad-tidings whose light hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the utterance of thy Lord, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Blessed art thou and they that are with thee. We have sent down for you that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.\n\nO 'Aziz! Upon thee be the glory of God and His loving-kindness. Thou hast attained unto turning toward Him and unto the praise of thy Lord, through Whom was manifested that which was hidden in knowledge and treasured in the protection of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The servant who is present hath submitted that which God cast into thy heart, and We have found therefrom the fragrance of orientation and turning unto Him. Verily thy Lord is the Remembering, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. Give thanks unto God for having brought forth from the treasury of thine utterance the pearls of His knowledge. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Say \\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having honored me with Thy days and illumined me with the lights of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the heaven of Thy grace, and by the Lamp that hath taken neither guard nor veil unto itself, to make me known by Thy Name and steadfast in the service of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, to open through the key of Thy All-Bountiful Name the doors of Thy favors, Thy mercy and Thy riches. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs of the first and the last. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee, upon thy tongue, upon thy heart and thy devotion, upon those who are with thee, and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every faithful and trusted one.\n\nPraise be to God! After the arrival of the letter another world appeared and another fragrance was diffused, for that which emanated from the essence of the heart was each a radiating light and a shining brilliance in praise and glorification of the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations. After its presentation and recitation the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this blessed word - exalted be His utterance: \"O servant in attendance, divine confirmation hath encompassed the dear one, upon him be My glory. Blessed be it unto him and may it be wholesome unto him.\"\n\nIn truth, in the earliest days, despite the turning away of most people, he attained the Kawthar of utterance in such wise that he was adorned with the ornament of acceptance and illumined with the light of good-pleasure. At the time of its presentation and recitation, the lips of the Intended One were smiling and the face of the Beloved was radiant and joyous. No deed until now has been lost nor shall it be. Mention and praise in these days, known as the Day of God, is considered the most excellent of remembrances. I have beseeched and do beseech God, exalted be His glory, for confirmation in mentioning and praising His loved ones. Praise be to God, the people of that household have, from the earliest days until now, been blessed with beholding the signs, reading the verses, and turning to the horizon of the Manifestation. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. His honor, the departed and elevated one, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, was mentioned most often in the presence of the Goal of the worlds. By the life of our Lord, he was repeatedly remembered in His presence and was blessed with special favors. At all times the assistance of grace reaches the elevated one in the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. I make mention of all the relatives and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for each one that which is the cause of exaltation and the means of elevation. Verily He fulfilleth the rewards of the doers of good and granteth the needs of the sincere ones.\n\nAs for their seeking permission to attain the presence and their supplication, after its presentation He said: \"In these days the wisdom to which all are commanded does not permit it. We bid thee to patience and forbearance and We beseech God to record for thee the reward of those who hastened and turned until they attained the presence and heard My mighty and wondrous call.\"\n\nIn truth, the reward of attaining the presence hath been written, recorded and confirmed for that spiritual loved one. Now it is fitting that not only \"blessed be it unto your honor\" be mentioned but also \"may it be wholesome unto your honor\" be said. Praise be to God, the Bestower of this lofty station and this mighty and wondrous mention. The dominion and the kingdom and the majesty and the power belong to God, the One, the All-Informed. Glory and mention and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and upon every one who hath arisen with supreme steadfastness to establish this Most Great and Mighty Cause.\n\nThe Servant\n\n9 Rajab 1308\n\n=== END BH00666 ===\n\n=== START BH00667 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nPraise, sanctified beyond all bounds and the limited world, befitteth the court of Him Who doeth whatsoever He willeth and decreeth whatsoever He pleaseth, Who with one blessed and exalted Word adorned the world with the ornament of existence and illumined it with the lights of the Sun of His grace. Out of pure bounty, generosity, kindness and mercy He sent down the Book and raised up Messengers that they might guide His creation to His straight path and enable them to attain unto His knowledge, which is the ultimate purpose for the creation of beings. These are the Manifestations of His Cause, the Dawning-places of His decree, the Recipients of His knowledge and the Daysprings of His remembrance, until this most great bounty and most perfect and transcendent grace reached its consummation in the person of the Seal, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. He is the Source and the Goal, He is the Manifestation and the Dawning-point. He is the Manifestation of the most excellent attributes and the most beauteous names. Through Him was the Mi'raj adorned and Batha illumined. Through Him was the Temple of Light established upon the Throne of Names and the Essence of Utterance seated upon the Throne of Speech. He is the Manifestation of \"He is the First and the Last\" and the Dawning-point of \"He is the Outward and the Inward.\" One word from the blessed Dawning-point of His remembrance appearing in the East - its influence and effect become manifest in the West. At His remembrance the Kingdom of remembrance falls silent, and at His utterance the Realm of speech becomes still. Through Him was made manifest all that was worthy of manifestation, and through Him was perfected all that befitted this station. However, in these days, due to the weakness of the people, power has undergone change and strength has ceased to penetrate. We must all, at all times, beseech and implore the Self-Subsisting Lord that He might renew the aging elements of the community with fresh and luminous garments. He is the Renewer, He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.\n\nO God, O Generous One, O Merciful One, O Forgiving One! The assaults of the polytheists have scattered the strongholds of the monotheists to the winds, and from the bullets of the deniers the edifice of remembrance and knowledge has been shaken, and the hearts of those near unto Thee and the sincere ones are trembling and agitated. Although, O All-Knowing God, the deeds of this people and their actions have, after glory, brought abasement, and after power have revealed weakness, yet we beseech of Thee Thy ancient grace and we entreat Thee: look not upon our deeds and actions, for they were not and are not worthy of Thy glance. Look upon Thine own mercy and bounty. Thou art He to Whose forgiveness every tongue hath testified, and to Whose power every seeing one hath witnessed. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nAnd furthermore, it is submitted to that honored beloved one that after your departure from Beirut several Sacred and Exalted Tablets were sent, which we hope reached you, and likewise are being sent this time. A letter from this evanescent one was written and sent to Ibn-i-Alif and Ha, upon them be the Glory of God, and that letter contains divine verses regarding the friends of those regions. After perusing and reading it, they should send it, or that beloved one himself may deliver it. God willing, may the sleeping ones of that land be awakened by your passing, may the dead be brought to life, and may the wanderers turn to their true homeland. In these days, in response to the letter of that honored master, upon him be all 9 \\[Glory\\] most glorious, a letter was submitted and sent, which also conveyed the favors of the Truth, exalted be His Glory, and two pages were also sent. As commanded, whatever was from before should remain as it was, and whatever has arrived and arrives thereafter should be sent. You yourself have seen and know the details of this land, so there is no need for mention. And in that letter, as commanded, mention was made of that beloved one, and likewise one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet specifically for Mulla Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was revealed from the heaven of favor and was written and sent in the original letter. God willing, may they attain unto it and become perfumed by its fragrance and receive new life from its breezes. Consider how many verses have been revealed and how many evidences have appeared during the nights and days - truly their enumeration is difficult except for Him, verily He is powerful over all things. And likewise this Supreme Word was revealed from the Tongue of the Manifestation of Names, blessed and exalted be His Word: \"O Present Servant, write to the Honorable Amin on behalf of the Wronged One to convey greetings to Nabil ibn Nabil. The favor of God, exalted be He, has been and is directed towards him. Truly the brothers have, from the first dawning of the Sun of Revelation until now, been occupied with mention and praise and have stood firm in service. God, His angels, His Prophets and His Messengers bear witness that they both turned to the Supreme Horizon when the Cry was raised and the Call was lifted. Blessed are they both and their father and those with them.\" End quote. This servant, the attendant, also extends greetings to them and begs confirmation from God, exalted be His station. Never has their mention been nor will it be effaced.\n\nLikewise mention was made of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. Praise be to God, he attained that which most of mankind are veiled from. On Friday night, the night of the full moon, the Sun of Divine utterance, may His glory be exalted, rose and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge. He said: Write to Jenab-i-Amin, upon him be My Glory, that he should convey Our greetings to Aqa Muhammad-'Ali in the land of Sad. The Wronged One has ever remembered the friends of God with the most excellent mention and utterance, and We beseech God to gather all beneath the shade of the Most Exalted Word and to unite all hearts and minds. He is the Sovereign in the shadow of Whose will all have ever dwelt and shall ever dwell. His is the creation and the command, His the power and the might, the will and the choice. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Compelling.\n\nThis servant also conveys his greetings to him. Some time ago a letter was written and sent to him, which was adorned with divine favors. Praise be to God, his services are mentioned in the presence of the Divine Countenance. It is hoped that the friends in every land and region will, with perfect love and unity, hold fast to that which will cause the exaltation of the Cause and act according to what is in the Book. Haji Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be God's favor, had a special Tablet which surely has arrived by now.\n\nAs commanded, convey special greetings to the friends in Sansan and other places and gladden them with the favors of God. God willing, may all hold fast to that which God loves. Your reward in all conditions rests with God, exalted be His glory. You have truly endured many hardships in His path and have mentioned the friends of every land in His presence. Today, when mention is made of any soul in His presence, a great reward is ordained for that one and is recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Whosoever has assisted you in service to the Cause has truly rendered service, and his reward rests with Him. Verily, He has power over all things. Say: Praise be to God, the Single, the All-Informed.\n\nThis evanescent servant is very pleased with that beloved one, for he has wished and continues to wish for the good of all. This is a mighty attribute. God willing, may you be adorned with this excellence in all conditions. This is a blessing that cannot be compared with any other blessing.\n\nThis servant further submits that you should convey greetings and salutations to each of the friends residing in God's lands. Most of them this year have been distressed, saddened and troubled by the wickedness of oppressive souls. However, praise be to God, one day this most exalted word was heard from the blessed tongue. He said, and His word is the truth: \"Verily, He has purified them and forgiven them, and His mercy that has preceded all in the kingdom of earth and heaven has encompassed them.\" This word is glad-tidings for the friends and loved ones, and a reward for their blessed temples. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. They have attained to God's mercy, favor, grace and bounty. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Kind, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you and upon those who act according to what they have been commanded in the Book of our Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n15th of the month of ?afar 1301\n\n=== END BH00667 ===\n\n=== START BH00668 ===\n\nThis is the Epistle of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting\n\nHe is the One Who heareth from His Realm of Glory.\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who hath appeared is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, the Most Great Book for all peoples, and the Heaven of bounty for the whole world. He is the Most Mighty Sign amongst men and the Dayspring of the most august attributes in the realm of creation. Through Him hath appeared that which had been hidden from time immemorial and been veiled from the eyes of men. He is the One Whose Manifestation was announced by the heavenly Scriptures, in former times and more recently. Whoso acknowledgeth belief in Him and in His signs and testimonies hath in truth acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven and the revelation of the Kingdom of Names. Through Him the ocean of knowledge hath surged amidst mankind and the river of divine wisdom hath gushed out at the behest of God, the Lord of Days.\n\nWell is it with the man of discernment who hath recognized and perceived the Truth, and the one possessed of a hearing ear who hath hearkened unto His sweet Voice, and the hand that hath received His Book with such resolve as is born of God, the Lord of this world and of the next, and the earnest wayfarer who hath hastened unto His glorious Horizon, and the one endued with strength whom neither the overpowering might of the rulers, nor the tumult raised by the leaders of religion hath been able to shake. And woe betide him who hath rejected the grace of God and His bounty, and hath denied His tender mercy and authority; such a man is indeed reckoned with those who have throughout eternity repudiated the testimony of God and His proof.\n\nGreat is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the things current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is ordained by God, the Lord of Names and the Fashioner of all created things, He Who is come from the heaven of eternity through the power of the Most Great Name, invested with so invincible an authority that all the powers of the earth are unable to withstand Him. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book, calling from the Most Sublime Station.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! We have repeatedly heard thy voice and have responded to thee with that which the praise of all mankind can never rival; from which the sincere ones inhale the sweet savors of the sayings of the All-Merciful, and His true lovers perceive the fragrance of heavenly reunion, and the sore athirst discover the murmuring of the water that is life indeed. Blessed the man who hath attained thereto and hath recognized that which is at this moment being diffused from the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. We testify that thou hast set thy face towards God and traveled far until thou didst attain His presence and gavest ear unto the Voice of this Wronged One, Who hath been cast into prison through the misdeeds of those who have disbelieved in the signs and testimonies of God and have denied this heavenly grace through which the whole world hath been made to shine. Blessed thy face, for it hath turned unto Him, and thine ear, for it hath heard His Voice, and thy tongue, for it hath celebrated the praise of God, the Lord of lords. We pray God to graciously aid thee to become a standard for the promotion of His Cause and to enable thee to draw nigh unto Him at all times and under all conditions.\n\nThe chosen ones of God and His loved ones in that land are remembered by Us, and We give them the joyful tidings of that which hath been sent down in their honor from the Kingdom of the utterance of their Lord, the sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning. Make mention of Me to them and illumine them with the resplendent glory of Mine utterance. Verily thy Lord is the Gracious, the Bountiful.\n\nO thou who dost magnify My praise! Give ear unto that which the people of tyranny ascribe unto Me in My days. Some of them say: \"He hath laid claim to divinity\"; others say: \"He hath devised a lie against God\"; still others say: \"He is come to foment sedition.\" Base and wretched are they. Lo! They are, in truth, enslaved to idle imaginings.\n\nWe shall now cease using the eloquent language. Truly thy Lord is the Potent, the Unconstrained. We would fain speak in the Persian tongue that perchance the people of Persia, one and all, may become aware of the utterances of the merciful Lord, and come forth to discover the Truth.\n\nThe first Tajalli which hath dawned from the Daystar of Truth is the knowledge of God--exalted be His glory. And the knowledge of the King of everlasting days can in no wise be attained save by recognizing Him Who is the Bearer of the Most Great Name. He is, in truth, the Speaker on Sinai Who is now seated upon the throne of Revelation. He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Symbol. All the former and latter Books of God are adorned with His praise and extol His glory. Through Him the standard of knowledge hath been planted in the world and the ensign of the oneness of God hath been unfurled amidst all peoples. Attainment unto the Divine Presence can be realized solely by attaining His presence. Through His potency everything that hath, from time immemorial, been veiled and hidden, is now revealed. He is made manifest through the power of Truth and hath uttered a Word whereby all that are in the heavens and on the earth have been dumbfounded, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to exempt. True belief in God and recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory.\n\nThey that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at all times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances and prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples--a light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth, and a fire unto such as turn away and deny.\n\nThe second Tajalli is to remain steadfast in the Cause of God--exalted be His glory--and to be unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be attained except through full recognition of Him; and full recognition cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words: \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth.\" Whoso tenaciously cleaveth unto this sublime word and drinketh deep from the living waters of utterance which are inherent therein, will be imbued with such a constancy that all the books of the world will be powerless to deter him from the Mother Book. O how glorious is this sublime station, this exalted rank, this ultimate purpose!\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers. They all give utterance to the words: \"Verily He is to be praised in His deeds and is to be obeyed in His behest.\" Nevertheless if We reveal aught which, even to the extent of a needle's eye, runneth counter to their selfish ways and desires, they will disdainfully reject it. Say, none can ever fathom the manifold exigencies of God's consummate wisdom. In truth, were He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to question His authority. This is that whereunto the Point of the Bayan hath testified in all that was sent down unto Him with truth at the behest of God, He Who hath caused the Dawn to break.\n\nThe third Tajalli is concerning arts, crafts and sciences. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words. Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book on the day of His return. Happy are those possessed of a hearing ear. In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this Most Great Prison.\n\nThe fourth Tajalli is concerning Divinity, Godhead and the like. Were a man of insight to direct his gaze towards the blessed, the manifest Lote-Tree and its fruits, he would be so enriched thereby as to be independent of aught else and to acknowledge his belief in that which the Speaker on Sinai hath uttered from the throne of Revelation.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Acquaint the people with the holy verses of thy Lord and make known unto them His straight Path, His mighty Announcement.\n\nSay: O people, if ye judge fairly and equitably, ye will testify to the truth of whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen. If ye be of the people of the Bayan, the Persian Bayan will guide you aright and will prove a sufficient testimony unto you; and if ye be of the people of the Qur'an, ponder ye upon the Revelation on Sinai and the Voice from the Bush which came unto the Son of 'Imran \\[Moses\\].\n\nGracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the One true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been developed and matured and would have reached its culmination. However, it is now clearly demonstrated that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated.\n\nO 'Ali! That which they accepted from the Bush they now refuse to accept from Him Who is the Tree of the world of existence. Say, O people of the Bayan, speak not according to the dictates of passion and selfish desire. Most of the peoples of the earth attest the truth of the blessed Word which hath come forth from the Bush. By the righteousness of God! But for the anthem of praise voiced by Him Who heralded the divine Revelation, this Wronged One would never have breathed a word which might have struck terror into the hearts of the ignorant and caused them to perish. Dwelling on the glorification of Him Whom God shall make manifest--exalted be His Manifestation--the Bab in the beginning of the Bayan saith: \"He is the One Who shall proclaim under all conditions, \"Verily, verily, I am God, no God is there but Me, the Lord of all created things. In truth all others except Me are My creatures. O, My creatures! Me alone do ye worship.'\" Likewise in another instance He, magnifying the Name of Him Who shall be made manifest, saith: \"I would be the first to adore Him.\" Now it behooveth one to reflect upon the significance of the \"Adorer\" and the \"Adored One,\" that perchance the people of the earth may partake of a dewdrop from the ocean of divine knowledge and may be enabled to perceive the greatness of this Revelation. Verily, He hath appeared and hath unloosed His tongue to proclaim the Truth. Well is it with him who doth acknowledge and recognize the truth, and woe betide the froward and the wayward.\n\nO kindreds of the earth! Incline your ears unto the Voice from the divine Lote-Tree which overshadoweth the world and be not of the people of tyranny on earth--men who have repudiated the Manifestation of God and His invincible authority and have renounced His favors--they in truth are reckoned with the contemptible in the Book of God, the Lord of all mankind.\n\nThe Glory which hath dawned above the horizon of My tender mercy rest upon thee and upon whosoever is with thee and giveth ear to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.\n\n=== END BH00668 ===\n\n=== START BH00669 ===\n\nHe is the All-Powerful, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering!\n\nThis is a Book which the Most Merciful hath sent down from the heaven of proof to manifest His testimony amongst His servants and His evidence throughout His realm. He, verily, is the Truth, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nHearken unto the Call from the direction of My Most Great Prison. Verily it hath been raised in truth and summoneth all men unto the straight path of God. This is the Day whereof Muhammad, the Apostle of God, gave glad tidings, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him He Who conversed with God. Yet the people are in thick veils. This is the Day whereon the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over all creation and the waters of life have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it, taken thereof and drunk therefrom. Woe unto the heedless!\n\nThe Promise hath come to pass and He Who conversed with God upon the Mount is seated upon the throne of Revelation, calling all unto God, the Lord of the worlds. When the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of the countenance of the Ancient of Days, the divines turned away and perpetrated that which caused the dwellers of the all-highest Paradise to lament and every fair-minded, clear-sighted one to cry out. These are the servants of whom the All-Merciful spoke in the Qur'an: they exchanged the favor of God for disbelief and led their people to the abode of perdition. Through their turning away the people turned away and denied Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries.\n\nThus doth My Most Glorious Pen recount unto thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who are thankful. Say: O concourse of men! Be fair, by God, the Lord of Power. If ye deny this Most Great Bounty, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Bring it forth then and be not of the wrongdoers.\n\nThis is the Day whereof the Apostle of God gave tidings, saying: \"The Day whereon all men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds,\" and of which the Primal Point gave glad tidings, saying when mentioning His Name: \"I, verily, am the first to worship Him.\"\n\nThy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We have heard what was therein and have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the light of God's favor, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We had held back the Pen for a long period, but when the appointed time came, We caused the Trumpet to sound, and it is My Most Exalted Pen, and We have revealed unto thee that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, shall endure.\n\nConsider the people of the Qur'an. They awaited the days of the Manifestation, yet when He came with the truth, they pronounced sentence of death against Him. Thereby did the Tablet and the Pen lament, and the foundations of the Primal Word were shaken. Thus did their souls prompt them. They are, in truth, among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nBlessed is thy letter, for it hath spoken the truth and testified to the oneness and singleness of God. Thy Lord doth witness and see, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. Through Him was raised the standard of unity and the banners of detachment, and all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\"\n\nVerily, when thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and been drawn by My call unto the kingdom of My utterance, say:\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having mentioned me through Thy most great signs, from which everyone possessed of perception perceiveth the fragrance of eternity. Glory be to Thee for having caused me to hear the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen and shown me Thy signs and most sublime words. I bear witness, O my God, to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been supreme over the kingdom of earth and heaven. Through Thy name the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" was raised. I beseech Thee, O Creator of heaven and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names, by the power of Thy Will and the manifestation of Thy Purpose, and by the Beloved through Whose advent the heavens of Thy might were honored, and by the Spirit whom Thou didst raise to the horizon of Thy Cause, and by the Rod that vanquished the swords and through which the stars of Thine enemies were dimmed and Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned by Thy might and power, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, such that names shall not prevent me from drawing near unto Thee, nor shall the gulf of idle fancies debar me from turning toward the shore of the ocean of Thy mercy. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne, the dawning-places of Thy revelation and the daysprings of Thine inspiration, to ordain for me what Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones who were not frightened by armies nor weakened by the power of the mighty. They stood before the faces of enemies declaring \"God is our Lord and the Lord of the exalted throne.\"\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Set aside the eloquent tongue and warble in the luminous language. We testify that by thy movement spirits took flight and the Dove of Utterance sang upon the highest branch of possibility. The veil hath been removed and the Lord of Creation hath come with the banners of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.\n\nHear thou in the Persian tongue the call of the Wronged One. First, the delay in reply was due to wisdom, and when the time came, that which is the immortal Kawthar for the fair-minded and the Salsabil of life for the thirsty was sent. Verily all affairs are in His hand and within His mighty grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nFrom the earliest days, this Wronged One addressed the faces of princes and divines with the most exalted call, and summoned all, without any veil or concealment, to the supreme horizon, the most exalted summit and the ultimate goal. In those days the limbs of the world trembled and were disturbed by the oppression of the transgressors. Surely that honor hath heard that a special Tablet was sent to each of the kings, including the Sovereign of Iran, and there befell this Wronged One that which caused the people of the cities of justice and fairness to weep. When some rays appeared from the horizons and a measure of assurance became evident, souls who were hidden behind the veil rushed forth with the swords of malice. By the life of God! They committed that which caused the tears of the near ones to flow, and they said that which the ancients never said.\n\nO thou who gazest toward the horizon! The eye was created for beholding and the ear for hearing, yet all are veiled and deprived save whom God willeth. The deniers of the Bayan have clung to the cord of the former people and walk in their footsteps. We make mention of one word that ye may drink from the ocean of knowledge and partake of the lights of the sun of wisdom, and ponder upon matters until that which is now hidden may be revealed. For twelve hundred years and more, the Shi'ih divines, whose number cannot be reckoned, were unaware of the Manifestation while still in the loins, and all were heedless of this most great Cause. Not one among these divines attained unto the truth. Now again Hadi-i-Dawlatabadi and certain other souls who have never had, nor now have, any knowledge of the Cause, desire to afflict the people with the delusions of the past. It behooveth you and the people of truth - those who have truly partaken of the choice sealed wine and attained unto the recognition of the Lord of Revelation - to protect the people from the delusions of the heedless ones, namely the deniers of the Bayan, lest these delusions resurface. The martyrdom of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - was caused by the calumnies of the past. We beseech God to assist thee, that perchance thou mayest guide those who wander in the wilderness of heedlessness to the lights of the Day-Star of certitude. We ask God to help thee and aid thee in serving His firm, impregnable and mighty Cause.\n\nConcerning what thou didst ask about sleep - praise be to God - it is evidence of thy devotion, steadfastness and support. And concerning His statement \"First, this group must be removed\" - the intention was Hadi-i-Dawlatabadi and the heedless souls gathered around him, but their removal was and is to be through the swords of wisdom and utterance. God willing, thou wilt arise to support the Cause, detached from the world and holding fast to the Most Great Name, and protect the helpless servants from the evil of that heedless one. They must reflect upon that which hath appeared and ponder the loss of the former people and their wretchedness and all that proceeded from them. If thou becomest aware, thou wilt find thyself seated upon the throne of certitude and assurance in this Most Great Revelation. Today is the day of service and the day of assistance through counsels and exhortations, for strife, corruption and contention have been forbidden in this Revelation. Now must thou, trusting in God and committing thy affairs unto Him, guide the servants to the highest horizon through remembrance and praise. This is not difficult for God. Then wilt thou find thyself detached from all else and arising to serve His Most Great Cause and His Mighty Message. Assuredly God, exalted be His glory, will deal with thee as He deemeth best. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's bounty, the Lord of the worlds, be upon thee and upon those whom neither the doubts of the divines nor the hints of the jurisprudents, nor the threat of the oppressors have deterred.\n\n=== END BH00669 ===\n\n=== START BH00670 ===\n\nIn the Name of the Most Glorious, the All-Glorious!\n\nThis is an epistle from the Primal Point and His Glory unto him who in the Heaven of Names hath been designated as Kazim and who hath been recorded as one of the believers in the Mother Book by the Pen of Command.\n\nO Kazim! The holy melodies of the Dove of Divine Unity have oft been mentioned in wondrous Arabic verses. Now they are set forth in sublime Persian that thou mayest fully attain unto the meanings of the divine utterances, that perchance thou mayest not be stirred by the blowing of the winds of polytheism that blow from the direction of self and passion, and that thou mayest cleave fast to the firm and unbreakable handle. First, know thou that the divine signs, whether of manifestation or concealment, whether of motion or stillness, of rising or sitting, and all else that pertaineth unto Him, are even as the sun between earth and heaven - manifest, resplendent and evident, in such wise that they cannot be confused with aught else, nor ever shall be. Every possessor of vision who gazeth toward the Greatest Perspective will assuredly distinguish the signs of truth from all else, even as one distinguisheth between black and white, heat and cold. Indeed, the possessors of the purest sense of smell will detect the holy fragrance of the Most Exalted from whatsoever manifesteth it. This is the truth whereof there is no doubt, save for impure souls who conceal themselves behind imaginary veils and prevent their penetrating vision from beholding the lights of the Countenance of Unity. These have no portion of this cup.\n\nConsider the manifestation of the Beauty of the Manifest One in the year sixty, when despite His mighty revelation and supreme sovereignty, all creatures high and low cast stones of hatred at that Furthermost Tree, that Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Thus did they act aforetime, as thou hast witnessed and heard, and art among those who bear witness. Beware lest thou place the reins of reason and understanding in the grasp of this or that person's account, and lest thou be deprived of the divine perspective through satanic whispers. Ever have all matters, both deeds and words, begun and ended with the verses of the Lord of Majesty, and after His manifestation nothing shall profit anyone save through His command, even should one perform the deeds of all in the heavens and earth. So mighty is His Cause that the Beauty of the All-Merciful hath counseled all in every leaf of the Bayan, even unto the Letters of the Living and the reflected Mirrors, lest at the time of His manifestation they should become occupied with outward leadership or with references that have been sent down, and remain veiled from Him through Whom all these stations were created by His word. Beyond this, in the Qayyumu'l-Asma', which is designated as the Best of Stories, there hath been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful's will these words, exalted be He:\n\n\"O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Stretch not forth thy hand in the Cause, for the people are in drunkenness from the mystery, and verily unto thee shall be the return after this cycle, by the Most Great Truth. There reveal thou of the mystery a mystery to the extent of a needle's eye upon the greatest Mount, that the people of Sinai may perish at the dawning place of a drop of that crimson Light, by God's leave, the All-Wise. And He is God, Who hath ever been thy Guardian through truth upon truth.\"\n\nNow the cycle is manifest and the Primal Beauty in another temple has risen like the sun, radiant and evident. And before the revelation of the mystery, the people of ?ur fell senseless and were annihilated. Reflect now upon the verse revealed from the heaven of divine unity's might, that perchance thou mayest attain unto a drop from the eternal, imperishable crystal stream. O Kazim! This wondrous Revelation is too great for anyone to hesitate, for its manifestation is more evident than the sun and its exaltation more lofty than the visible heavens. All who are in the heavens and earth are on one level, save whom thy Lord willeth. Know thou the peerless Beauty by His own Self, not by likenesses and comparisons, for He cannot be known except through Himself, nor recognized through questioning. \"Know God through God and through what proceedeth from Him.\" O Kazim! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy and desire, enter the most exalted Paradise, and summon the people, without veil or hindrance, unto the Lord of Lords. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! These utterances have no purpose save the good-pleasure of the All-Glorious, that perchance mortal souls may enter the eternal Paradise. In this ocean naught is found save pure and luminous pearls, and this Tree beareth none but goodly fruit. Well is it with them that seek! O Kazim! Close thine eyes to all the worlds and drink the living waters of divine knowledge from the celestial youths. Give no ear to the vain imaginings of the manifestations of Satan, for in this day the manifestations of Satan sit in ambush upon the path of divine unity, preventing the people by every stratagem. Soon shalt thou witness how the people of the Bayan will turn away from the Manifestation of the All-Merciful. Thus did my Beloved inform me before the creation of the heavens and earth, and before the creation of the worlds. Say: O people of the Bayan! If ye turn away from these revealed verses and manifest evidences that have encompassed all creation, by what proof and argument will ye establish your faith in God's Messengers? Nay, by Him Who causeth the Spirit to speak within my breast! Their faith shall not be proven; rather, their deeds shall come to naught and their actions shall be rendered void, and they shall return to the very depths of hellfire. O Kazim! Rise like a brilliant star from the horizon of the heaven of guidance and strive, as much as lieth in thy power, to exalt and elevate the Cause of God. Purify thy heart from attachment to aught else but Him and enter beneath the shade of divine glances and the gaze of thy Lord. For in this day, save His shade, the decree of wilderness prevaileth and is true. At this time when the breezes of polytheism blow from every direction and the manifestations of falsehood are visible from every quarter, such grief hath encompassed me that were it to be mentioned it would cause sorrow to all beings in all the worlds. Yet my grief is not for myself, but rather I lament for the Beauty of the Worshipped One and His manifestation on the Promised Day. For the people of the Bayan, though but a short time hath passed since the manifestation of the King of divine revelation and though they witnessed with their own eyes the manner of His appearance, have become veiled as thou seest. What then will befall that resplendent Beauty? Alas for the servants! No Beauty appeareth unto them but they conceal His beauty behind veils of rancor and hatred, then mock Him\\[...\\]\n\nI swear by the sovereign Lord Who doeth what He willeth that the soul who hath not believed and been assured of this celestial Manifestation will not turn to any of the divine Manifestations and holy Daysprings of His unity. Would that they had sufficed themselves with turning away and had not pronounced sentence of death against Him, as in these days they were not content with mere rejection. Would that the illumined eye had been manifest, that it might have beheld the gates of the paradise of inner meanings flung open, and become acquainted with but a single letter of the hidden divine mysteries. My oppression hath reached such a pass as to efface the name of oppression from every oppressed one. Thereupon do weep the eyes of grandeur behind the pavilions of concealed glory.\n\nSome time ago thy letter reached the hidden abode of the Sovereign Lord of Names and was grasped by the hand of might of Him Who ordaineth as He pleaseth. Due to what was ordained in the heaven of destiny, the reply was delayed, but through the precedence of thy Lord's mercy over all existence, an answer is now sent. Thou must, God willing, exert thy utmost endeavor in safeguarding the Cause of God. God forgiveth what is past, and whosoever ariseth today to aid the Cause of God, the Holy Spirit will descend to assist him. Marvel not at the command of thy Lord, and be not of the doubting ones. God willing, mayest thou not be deprived of the radiance of the rising Sun of inner meanings in this spiritual dawn and divine morn, nor be denied the bounties of the Glorious Cloud. Thus hath been ordained from the grace of thy Lord, if thou dost not withhold from thyself the robes of His guidance and art of those who are firm in the religion of God. Then convey Our remembrance to those servants who have fulfilled God's covenant and acknowledged His sovereignty, and to all those men and women who are with thee. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Forgiving.\n\n=== END BH00670 ===\n\n=== START BH00671 ===\n\nO Ali-Naqi, upon thee be the Glory of God!\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nThis is the Day wherein that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Furqan hath come to pass. The sky hath brought forth manifest smoke, and darkness hath enveloped most lands by reason of the thunder of the cannons of the heedless. Lo, the speckled serpent doth advance and hiss, while the snake of darkness hath sunk to the depths of hell. This is the Day wherein the hearts of men are sorely troubled and the foundations of all lands are shaken by the might of those who have denied God's truth and His proof.\n\nO beloved of My heart! The scratching of thy pen hath gladdened Me, and the fragrance of thine utterance, which I perceived from thy letter, hath stirred Me. When I read and understood it, I made for the highest summit and the supreme horizon until I attained the presence of the Lord of Names. He, glorified be His majesty, said: \"What is in thy hand, O thou who art present?\" I presented the letter of one who hath turned to Thee, placed his trust in Thee, and held fast unto Thee. Thereupon He commanded me to present it, and I laid it before His countenance. When it was completed, the Tongue of the Lord of all beings spoke that which would melt the hardest rock. He spoke, and His word is the truth:\n\nO Ali! I have found the fragrance of thy love from the garment of thy words, and witnessed thy turning toward thy Lord's horizon, and heard thy call in praise of thy Lord. Blessed be thy face for having turned, thy heart for having drawn nigh, and thy tongue for having uttered praise of the Wronged One, from Whom most of the servants have turned away, save those whom God, the Helper, the All-Knowing, hath willed.\n\nO Pure One! Rejoice in My remembrance. We have heard thy yearning in the love of God and have turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison in days wherein sorrows have encompassed Us from every side through that which the hands of those who have turned away from the Face have wrought, and who have cast behind their backs the straight Path of God. This is a Day wherein the religion of God lamenteth and every wise command crieth out. The heedless have cast the Cause of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain desires. They are indeed among the most lost in God's Book, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nToday the Ancient Beauty proceeded from the mansion of Udi to the garden, and after partaking of tea, this servant presented himself with your letter, and after permission was granted, read it. He was blessed both with His attention and honored with His reply. In other places too, mention of you hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in such wise that nothing on earth can compare with it. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful ones. Verily He saw thy devotion and thy turning unto Him, and was with thee when thou didst leave thy house, turning toward God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nWhoso hath attained My presence hath attained unto all good. The Books of God, both past and future, have testified to this. Blessed is he who hath recognized and is among those who have attained. No Book there is but hath taken My Covenant, no Scripture but hath spoken My praise, and no Tablet but hath heralded unto the people My wondrous and glorious Revelation. Thou art he who hath been blessed with the mention of God time and again, and hast heard My sweetest call when thou wert present at the Supreme Horizon. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed.\n\nConvey My Great Glory unto the faces of My loved ones who have acted according to that which they were commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We make mention of him who hath been named Jalal, that it may be a treasure for him and an honor from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Jalal! Hearken to the Call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee from this Spot which He hath related unto Himself and adorned with the ornament of acceptance and illumined with the lights of His Countenance. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. The glory that proceedeth from Us rest upon thy father and thy mother and upon thee and upon those whom the affairs of the world have not kept back from the Lord of all creation. Summon ye the world through this Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named 'Ata in the Most Exalted Horizon, that he may hear thy most sweet call and say: \"Here am I, here am I, O Lord of all mankind! I thank Thee, O Lord of existence, for having remembered me in the prison and for having turned toward me with a face that hath illumined the horizons. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, through which Thou hast subdued the world, to assist me in this Cause whereby necks have been humbled. Then write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all commands and ordinances.\"\n\nHold thou fast unto the cord of My bounty and cling to the hem of My mercy. Thy Lord doth witness and behold, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAnd We make mention of him who hath ascended unto God, who was named Jamal, that this remembrance may be a provision for him in all habitations and journeys. He journeyed unto God until he attained unto the Most Exalted Companion - a station whereof were the light of but a needle's eye to be revealed unto the world, all its peoples would be thunderstruck. The Mother Book beareth witness unto this. We have made mention of all who, whether young or old, have adorned themselves with the ornament of knowledge and have been illumined by the lights of existence in the days of the All-Merciful. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken when the Tongue of Grandeur spoke from the most exalted station.\n\nThe servant testifieth that the world hath been illumined by the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful which shone forth from the heaven of knowledge in this place that hath been named Ridvan and at times the Garden, and which relateth that which the All-Merciful revealed aforetime when His throne was upon the waters. In truth, how can this feeble servant be worthy of this noble station except through God's grace and the aid of the friends' attention and prayers? The Command is in His hand - He doeth and judgeth as He pleaseth, and He is the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.\n\nRegarding what was written about Aqa Mirza Abdul-Husayn, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], it was submitted and He said: \"God willing, may the fragrance of the King of Martyrs be diffused from him. By the life of God, were the station of the Twin Shining Lights to be revealed to the people of the world, all would exclaim, 'Thine is the greatness, O Lord of the worlds!' All souls who are related to the Twin Shining Lights are mentioned in the presence of the Countenance, and what is meant by this relationship is the true relationship, for if they remain deprived of it, the outward relationship will not compensate nor yield fruit. Today all relationships are severed save the relationship with God. Blessed is he who hath clung thereunto, and woe unto those who stray. We send Our greetings upon his face and counsel him with that wherewith We have counseled Our servants aforetime, and We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him to stand firm in this mighty Cause.\"\n\nAnd as for your mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, his mention had previously been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. God willing, he has and will continue to attain the honor of its perusal. Convey on behalf of this ephemeral one greetings to the friends of God. The Truth that knoweth and witnesseth all things is aware that they have not been absent from sight for a moment, and all have the station of a single word, standing before His eyes - meaning those souls whom worldly concerns did not prevent from the Most Exalted Horizon, and whom the thundering of the cannons of oppression did not hold back from the light of justice. This ephemeral one wrote a letter to the beloved of the heart, Jinab-i-Asad, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, the King, the Single, the One, which was sent. God willing it will reach him. Another letter was also sent several months ago which apparently has not yet arrived, and a copy of it has been sent again. It is hoped that it will arrive. And as for the letter of Ibn-i-Ismu'llah-i-Asdaq, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, and all the Most Excellent Grace, and all the Most Luminous Light, etc. of the well-known prayer - it arrived and a detailed response was written containing divine verses. However, due to the turmoil and disturbances in these parts, it was not sent. A brief response addressing some of his questions was written and sent. God willing it will be dispatched in these few days, as the route has now opened and some measure of assurance has been obtained. And regarding what was written about expansion, it was submitted and He said: \"Grieve not, for He will send down upon thee from the heaven of His bounty that which shall profit thee in His worlds. He is the Single, the One, the Self-Sufficient, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.\" This ended here. Praise be to God that this ephemeral one was assisted in presenting this response, and it has reached this point. And the Leaf desires to conclude with the Name of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, that its ending may be musk and joy and delight. May the Glory that shineth, appeareth and blazeth forth from the lights of the Face be upon you and upon those whose names you mentioned in your letter, and upon those who hold fast to righteousness out of love for God, Creator of the heavens and Originator of all things.\n\n21 Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1299\n\n=== END BH00671 ===\n\n=== START BH00672 ===\n\nO Ali! Give thanks to God for having adorned your head with the crown of praise in the days of your Lord, the Possessor of Names, and your temple with the ornament of His service throughout all possibility. We have become aware of your journey to certain regions and your migration in the path of God, the Revealer of verses. This befits you and every devoted soul who has detached himself in His love from all else. O Ali! Under all conditions, exert your utmost effort to unite hearts and gather them together around the Divine Law of God's Cause. Although through God's grace you are adorned with virtuous character, yet the more you add to it the more beloved it is in the sight of God, so that all may turn to the All-Bestowing through your goodly characteristics. Be vigilant regarding the Cause at all times, as has been revealed from the Pen of Command in previous Tablets. Observe the grace, favor and kindnesses of God. For years one of the servants, whom you know, though he and his followers have secretly been occupied with unseemly words, foul odors and selfish conditions - and God is aware and encompassing of all - We concealed it. As he outwardly spoke the name of God and His mention, We did not oppose him. Over several years, from the Dawning-Place of verses exalted Tablets were specifically revealed and sent to him. In all conditions, both explicitly and implicitly, We summoned him to that pure station which is sanctified from any trace of self and existence, that perchance he might attain the lofty, inaccessible stations. All this was from the grace, mercy and favor of your Lord, for We have never wished nor do We wish that any soul should be deprived of that for which it was created or remain without portion of that which was ordained for it. Despite these successive favors and continuous kindnesses, it is as though he considered God heedless and that God's concealment was due to him. Say: May my spirit and soul be sacrificed for You, O Concealer of the worlds! O Ali! Observe the Cause of the Messenger of God, how at first it was in the utmost ascendancy and elevation, but later it halted. One of the causes that prevented it was that certain souls arose and, claiming they possessed inner knowledge, prevented the helpless people from the Divine Law and the repositories of divine glory. Say: By God! All that is manifest is more exalted than your inner knowledge and every shell is more luminous than your kernel. The sincere have abandoned your inner meanings just as bones are abandoned to dogs.\n\nIn these days Divine ordinances are dawning from the Dayspring of heavenly utterance. God willing, they shall be sent hereafter. These two blessed verses were revealed in that Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet: \"Among the people is he who taketh his seat in the row of sandals, yet seeketh the seat of honor. Say: Who art thou, O heedless deceiver! And among them is he who claimeth inner knowledge, and knowledge within knowledge. Say: O thou liar! By God, what thou hast is naught but husks which We have left to you as bones are left to dogs.\"\n\nConsider how every vain soul that appeared drew forth a channel from the Most Great Ocean, and with all deceit and guile arose with personal imaginings and selfish passions, and divided the Muslim community. Say: O thou deluded one! Verily the inner meaning, and the meaning within the inner meaning, and that inner meaning which God hath sanctified beyond all inner and outer meanings unto infinity, circle round this outward Manifestation Who speaketh the truth at the world's center. The Most Great Name hath appeared, the Lord of nations and the Ancient King. None hath any refuge or dwelling-place save in cleaving to this Luminous Handle whereby earth and heaven were illumined, the Throne and the dust shone forth, the Kingdom of Names was lit up, and the Supreme Horizon was illumined. Fear ye God, O people, and follow not the desires of those who follow their lusts, nor the imaginings of those who have arisen with deceit in the realms of creation. Turn with shining faces and radiant brows unto the Dawning-Place of the signs of your Lord, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Tablet which God hath made the Mother of Tablets and the Lamp of Prosperity between the heavens and the earths.\n\nO Ali! The division of the community hath become the cause and reason for universal weakness, yet most people understand not. Would that certain souls who claim ardor and attraction, passion and enchantment, and the like, would go to Constantinople and observe the Qadiriyyih monastery and become warned. O Ali! A group is gathered in that place, and by the True One Himself, it hath been witnessed that one of those souls continuously struck himself against stone and mud and wall for more than four hours until there was fear of his perishing. Then he would fall unconscious to the ground and for about two hours would have no awareness at all. And they count these things among spiritual gifts. God is quit of them and We are quit of them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He knoweth the treachery of eyes and what lieth hidden in the breasts of men.\n\nLikewise there is a group known as the Rifa'i. These souls, by their own account, walk through fire and in moments of ecstasy strike each other with swords in such manner that the observer would think they had severed their own limbs. All this is but tricks and deceit and guile from their own selves. Lo! They are among the most lost. All these things have been witnessed firsthand and most people have seen them. How desirable it would be if one of those deluded souls would turn toward that land and witness the aforementioned monasteries and what transpires therein, that perchance through selfish thoughts and the delusions of deceitful souls he might not be debarred from the direction of Divine Unity and the Lord of all creation.\n\nO Ali! There are and have been people in the islands of India who have denied themselves food and drink, have found companionship with wild beasts, and spend their nights and days in arduous spiritual exercises, constantly engaged in remembrance. Nevertheless, not one of these souls is mentioned in the presence of God, even though they count themselves among the pillars, stakes and unique ones of the earth. Today, the robe of deeds and the crown of actions is the mention of the Most Great Name, both outwardly and inwardly. Verily, it is the Word whereby every party hath been separated, every mountain hath been scattered, every star hath fallen, every sun hath been darkened, every moon hath been eclipsed, every heaven hath been cleft asunder, every earth hath been split, every sea hath subsided, every peak hath trembled, every trunk hath been uprooted, every hill hath been shaken, and every plain hath quaked, save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, hath willed. Whoso acknowledgeth what God hath acknowledged, and confesseth what God hath confessed, is of the people of Baha in the kingdom of creation. Thus hath the command of thy Lord, the Firm, the Mighty, the Wise, been sent down from the horizon of revelation.\n\nAlthough it is not befitting that the Supreme Pen be occupied with such utterances, yet in view of grace and the precedence of mercy, the Pen of the All-Merciful speaketh in such wise. Where are the mighty ones? Where are the manifestations of steadfastness in the kingdom of creation? Where are the dawning-places of power in the heaven of detachment? O Ali! Until now the Finger of Power hath not rent asunder the veils. Verily, thy Lord is the Concealer. Beseech God that He may cause those souls to remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of all days, with complete steadfastness, detached from all else but Him. By My life! Through this their mention shall be exalted, their names confirmed, their stations realized, and the doors of My knowledge - which is the foundation of the Cause and its beginning, the essence of glory and its sovereign - shall be opened before their faces. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world and whatsoever is mentioned therein, and hath turned with an illumined heart toward the court of his Lord, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great.\n\nYour burden is great. Bear it as this Most Tender, Most Delicate, Most Compassionate, Gentle, Wondrous, Luminous Heart hath borne above it. For you must, with wisdom as commanded in all Tablets, purify the people from personal imaginings and unseemly conditions through effective counsels and divine wisdom, and lead them to the most holy court. The first and greatest matter is steadfastness in the Cause. God willing, you must be engaged in service at all times, as indeed you are. Verily, the glory be upon you and upon those who love you purely for the sake of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00672 ===\n\n=== START BH00673 ===\n\nThe honored gentleman, His Holiness Afnan, his esteemed honor Aqa Mirza Aqa, may the Most Glorious Glory of God rest upon him.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His majesty, grandeur and power.\n\nHow delightful is the breeze of reunion that hath wafted, and the fragrance of meeting that hath been diffused at this hour, five hours before sunset, for a distinguished letter bearing spiritual and divine glad-tidings hath arrived. It hath opened the gate of truth and renewed the covenant of presence. In truth, the pen is a great sign from the Ancient Lord, and ink is the supreme gate of love and unity. These two have ever been and shall continue to be the movers of the cord of love. Were the favors of God, exalted be His glory, and likewise the effects and fruits ordained for these two to become manifest, the world would be struck with wonderment. Glorified be their Creator, their Educator and their Originator.\n\nOn this day, the twenty-fourth of the blessed month of Ramadan, at seven o'clock, while this lowly one was sitting still and silent, the Clear Book arrived - that is, your letter. It was a true breaking of the fast, and a spiritual fulfillment of yearning and longing. The fragrance of the pen was diffused in such wise as to dispel all traces of weariness, cares and sorrows. Praise be to God, spirit and heart were adorned with the ornament of joy and gladness. After reading it with delight and joy, I approached the Shrine and attained the honor of hearing these exalted words:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nO Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God and His mercy! The servant who is present read the letter which was present before the face \\[of God\\]. From every word wafted the fragrance of sincerity, humility, submissiveness, and praise and glorification of God, the Blessed, the Exalted. Each of its words testified with most eloquent utterance to thy devotion, thy steadfastness and thy turning unto Him. Well is it with thee! Pleasant it is to thee! Thou hast taken the cup of divine knowledge from the hand of bounty and drunk therefrom in the name of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The Blessed Tree hath made mention of its Afnans and continueth to do so. His grace hath encompassed them in all conditions and He is with you wheresoever ye may be. Praise be to God! Ye are mindful and are remembered. The slumber of idle fancies hath prevented the world from beholding the lights of truth and perceiving the effulgences of the Day-Star of divine favor. Glory be to God! The favored community remaineth until now heedless and veiled from the cause of afflictions, tribulations and their abject abasement. The cities and habitations of the people of divine unity are surrounded, while the polytheists encompass them. Every day a tree is uprooted by devastating winds and a lamp is extinguished. This most grievous malady hath seized the realm of the people of unity, yet despite this they neither have sought nor seek to remove this darkest of afflictions. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, that through the breezes of the spiritual morn He may grant awareness to His servants, that perchance they may arise from the sleep of heedlessness and act as behooveth them. The Law of God preserveth His servants, and the fear of God restraineth them from that which is forbidden. Yet in this day these two are as rare as red sulfur. Blessed are they who have held fast to the Most Great Law and the mightiest ordinance. We testify that they are the knights in the arena of divine knowledge among all religions. Nothing whatsoever hath prevented them, neither the veils of the world nor the coverings of the nations. These are they whom God hath described in His mighty Book, saying: \"Neither merchandise nor traffic beguile them from the remembrance of God.\" Blessed art thou, O Afnan! We beseech God to open before thy face the gates of grace and blessing, and to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Almighty, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Most Generous.\n\nO Siyyid Aqa! Upon thee be the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. Thy mention was made in the presence of the Wronged One and His grace hath encompassed thee. Praise be to God! Thou hast attained unto that which was the purpose of creation. Peace and glory be upon you, O Afnan, and the mercy of God and His blessings and His loving-kindness and His favors.\n\nThe effulgences of the Sun of true divine unity have shone upon your honor and the rain of divine mercy hath descended upon your noble being. A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of the world's peoples that despite the encompassing enemies and the might of the princes and divines of Iran, the way of communication and association with news and writings remaineth open and evident. Tongues cannot adequately render thanks for this peerless blessing unless His grace assist them. His gratitude hath ever outstripped those who are thankful, His praise those who praise, and His mercy the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. In these days the government hath changed. I beseech God to adorn the throne of sovereignty with the form of justice and equity. Verily, He hath power over all things. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Eternal Truth to make your honor a dawning-place for the spreading of His verses and laws and a wellspring of His outpourings\\[...\\]\n\nConcerning the mention of Aqa Khan and his arrival with others, as well as the counsel and conversation with him which they had recorded - this was one of the fruits of His Highness's journey. This matter is evidence of the promotion and will of God, exalted be His glory, and likewise bears witness to His true blessings and favors. After this matter was presented before Him, they were inspired to deliver the Word of Truth and imparted that which was manifestly guidance and evident counsel.\n\nO Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God and His favors. This Wronged One hath in all conditions proclaimed the Word of God with the most exalted call, and hath summoned all to that which preserveth them, profiteth them and strengtheneth them. In one of the holy Tablets these words were recorded: Should this Wronged One be drowned in the sea, He would arise from the mountaintops crying \"The Kingdom is God's!\" And should He be buried in the earth beneath its layers, His call would be heard from the heaven, drawing the servants to the most exalted Paradise. No impediment existeth in that realm and no veil remaineth. The Command is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nIn this night thy mention was made repeatedly. Should the servants turn unto that which profiteth them, they shall have attained; and should they turn away, verily He is independent of them. His perspicuous Book beareth witness unto this. In times of tribulation, hardship and adversity, He speaketh and hath spoken without concealment that which is the cause of the supreme triumph and the guidance of the nations. Now the Wronged One and His Afnan hold fast to wisdom and utterance, and speak that which guideth the servants to the Path. Whoso wisheth, let him accept, and whoso wisheth, let him turn away. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Self-Sufficient, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nFrom the heaven of utterance, rains have descended in such measure that preservation and presentation have not been possible save in limited measure. Concerning what was written about that land, truly freedom, civilization and its means are daily increasing, especially now that it hath become the place and residence of His Highness. And concerning what was written about the empty shop with the sign \"I have placed my trust in God\" - truly this is a most perfect merchandise and great in the sight of God. After this matter was presented before Him, they said that this exalted word is like unto a magnet, nay rather greater, attracting that which is the cause of bounty, blessing and nearness unto God. This bounty hath no likeness or equal. Praise be unto Him for what He hath ordained for His Afnan. We beseech Him to aid him with the hosts of grace and favors. Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful.\n\nThey smiled much at these words and uttered that which shall have its effect hidden and concealed in the world. God shall soon make it manifest through a command from His presence. He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nTo the beloved of the heart, Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] the Most Glorious, I convey greetings and make mention that God is witness and testament that the servant hath ever been and is present before Him. I beseech the Most High to make him one of the interpreters of revelation and inspiration. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you, who love you and who hear your word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n24 Ramadan the Blessed 1305\n\n=== END BH00673 ===\n\n=== START BH00674 ===\n\nO Haji Mirza 'Ali-Akbar from the land of Nur and Ra, upon him be \\[Baha'u'llah's\\] Glory \\[96\\] First Jumada 1304\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise and glory befit those souls at rest and those hearts of strength whom neither the swords of the wicked prevented from the traces of the Chosen One nor did the ranks of oppression hold back from manifesting justice. By their steadfastness the feet of the heedless were shaken, and by their arising the manifestations of power were brought low. They are the dawning-places of might among the servants and the manifestations of what God has willed in the lands. All created things offer prayers upon them when the lights of attributes shine forth.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest my weakness and my impotence. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne and the chosen ones among Thy servants, and by the breath wherewith Thou hast given life unto Thy creation, to assist Thy friends and loved ones to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, and to arise to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest that I desired to make mention of one of Thy servants from whom and from whose son numerous letters have come in Thy praise and glorification, but the abundance of writing before Thy presence has prevented me from responding. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom, to grant me time not bounded by hours and minutes that I may make mention of Thy loved ones and give them glad tidings of Thy favors and bounty. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThereafter, this servant submits that the letters of your honor and your son - upon you both be the Glory of God - arrived one after another like daily sustenance. In truth, they were strengthening nourishment and a joy-giving elixir, for each was adorned with the mention and praise of the Goal of all the worlds. However, the delay in responding was not due to negligence or lack of attention and shortcoming on the part of this servant, but rather due to the abundance of writing before the Throne and lack of opportunity and time. God suffices as witness. The Truth, exalted be His glory, is witness and testament that you have ever been remembered before this evanescent servant and your remembrance and mention have never left my heart, let alone my tongue. At one time, after your honored brother and cherished companion's letter was submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these brilliant verses were revealed from the King of earth and heavens. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Informed \\[...\\]\n\nEver has the Pen of the Ancient King been engaged and astir in remembrance of His friends. At times the Euphrates of mercy hath flowed from it, and at others the perspicuous Book hath been revealed therefrom. He is the Unique One and the First Speaker of the world. Ever hath He been established upon the throne of transcendence, uttering sufficient counsels and beneficial admonitions. God is witness and mankind doth testify that He hath not for a moment concealed or hidden Himself. He hath arisen before the faces of all the peoples of the world and commanded whatsoever He desired. His purpose hath been the reformation of the world and the tranquility of nations. This reformation and tranquility shall not appear except through unity and harmony, and this shall not be achieved except through the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen. His utterance doth illuminate the horizons with the light of unity. His mention kindleth the fire of love and consumeth the veils that intervene and the barriers that separate. One pure deed shall transcend the heavens; it shall loose the bound wing and restore departed strength. The Shi'ih sect, through their ingratitude and failure to recognize the truth, are accounted as the basest of all sects in the sight of the Lord of all mankind. For thirteen hundred years they cried \"O Truth!\" and then martyred Him with the swords of hatred. Such was their recompense on the Day of Retribution, and from that station their deeds are manifest and evident unto this time. The people of Divine Unity are not aware of the cause and reason for the humiliation that hath befallen them. They were the most powerful of all sects, yet now they are seen as the weakest of all sects. Power hath been transformed into weakness, wealth into poverty, glory into abasement, and profit into loss. By the life of God! All this hath been and is the recompense of their deeds. And now, like unto Qarun, they sink into the earth the measure of one measure every moment, yet they perceive it not. Ere long they shall witness in the visible realm whatsoever hath been revealed in the Tablets from the Most Exalted Pen. O people of God! Sanctification, sanctification! Fear of God, fear of God! Be ye like unto the free cypress, and like unto the heart of Baha, detached and free. Say: O people of God! The Helper and Succourer and the hosts of God are, in the Scriptures and Tablets, manifest and evident as the sun. These hosts have ever been and shall remain goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Whosoever today rendereth assistance through the hosts of righteous deeds and character, and ariseth to serve for God and in the path of God, assuredly shall his traces become manifest and evident in all regions. O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God and its influence, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and provided for me, and thanks be to Thee for having made me to know Thee and drawn me nigh unto Thee. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Ancient Days, by Thy Most Great Name and by Thy firm and decisive Command whereby Thou hast subdued the nations, to make me in all conditions to hold fast to the cord of Thy bounty and to cling to the hem of Thy generosity. My Lord! Thou seest me turning toward the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Source of Thy favors. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and by that which hath flowed from Thy Pen to aid me in that which beseemeth Thy days and from which the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure is wafted. Then ordain for me and for those with me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mankind. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nWho can reckon the lights of the luminary of His grace, and who can attain unto the highest pinnacle, the station of His remembrance and utterance? He is the One through Whose word appeared the seas and their waves and what lay concealed therein, and the trees and their fruits and leaves and branches and what was hidden within them, and the mountains and what lay therein of minerals and their mysteries, and the earth and what was treasured therein and appeared therefrom, and the heaven and its suns and stars and creation. This is the station of but one word from the divine words that hath been mentioned with utmost brevity. Should man reflect even briefly upon the ocean of power, he would find himself bewildered. In truth, no tongues, pens or tablets can fulfill or reach its end. Exalted be His grandeur, sublime be His signs, perfect be His favors, and abundant be His bounties and blessings. How often during nights and days doth this servant observe himself bewildered and deep in thought, for on one hand the signs of power, grandeur, loftiness, loving-kindness and mercy of God, exalted be His glory, are witnessed, and on the other hand the people are seen veiled, forbidden, deprived, heedless and bereft. Glory be to God! What heedlessness hath encompassed the hearts and minds! After witnessing and observing the world of power, might, mercy and bounty, they pass it by and occupy themselves with matters unworthy of mention. This servant and your honor and other friends and loved ones must supplicate the Self-Sufficient with utmost lowliness and imploring, that perchance He may refresh His dispirited servants through the rains of mercy and grant them awareness from the ocean of grace. He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth and He confirmeth whatsoever He desireth.\n\nI beseech God, exalted be His glory, for confirmation and seek His aid that I may make mention of the apple of your eye, Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the glory of God, and fulfill this task. Indeed this word is mentioned by way of apology, for his letters were received repeatedly, but this servant's pen found not the opportunity to reply. However, God is witness and aware that you and your relatives have ever been and are before our eyes and have ever been mentioned in the Most Sublime Vision. It is hoped that complete fruit may be yielded and enduring traces may appear, for any deed - whether it be remembrance, utterance, or action - that is performed for God's sake shall not be without effect. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful, and verily He is the Gracious, the Merciful, and the Manifest Forgiver. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon your son and upon those whom the fire hath not prevented from drawing nigh unto the light. And praise be to the Lord of the Manifestation.\n\n=== END BH00674 ===\n\n=== START BH00675 ===\n\nIn the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise and glory befit that Speaker to Whom all created things owe their existence, Who hath renewed the entire world through His Most Exalted Word that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen, and Who hath commanded mankind to that which shall profit them in all the worlds of His creation. He is the All-Seeing One for Whose call all ears have been created, and He is the All-Perceiving One for Whose dawning-place all eyes have been brought from nothingness into being. Through His Will and by His hand the kingdom of all things hath been made manifest, and through His all-encompassing Purpose whatsoever He willeth and decreeth doth shine forth. All things testify to His power and the Concourse on High bear witness to His grandeur. He is the Peerless One Who hath ever been sanctified above all likeness and similarity and will forever remain so. There is none like unto Him; He is the One Who is manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nI offer praise, salutations and glory unto those servants who have tasted the sweetness of His utterance, who have hastened to the ocean of life through His bidding and leave, and who attained the choice wine when its seal was broken by His name and His finger. These are servants who have cast away the world and have taken hold of that which they were commanded in His Book that hath descended from His dominion and might.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which the foundations of every idolater were shaken and every denier did lament, to aid those who have quaffed the Kawthar of Thy love to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. Then make them, O my God, the emblems of Thy Name in Thy lands and the standards of Thy guidance in Thy realm. Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no thing can hinder. Thou givest and withholdest, and Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nThereafter, thy letter was received which, praise be to God, was illumined with the light of certitude and perfumed with the fragrance of divine love. This utter nothingness and complete nonexistence doth at all times beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may illumine all servants with the lights of certitude. Today is the springtime of precious things. Tongues, eyes, ears and hearts were created for this most holy and most exalted Day, yet most of the servants are seen to be bereft and deprived of this awareness. In the watches of the night and throughout the day they are occupied with His remembrance, yet remain veiled from Him. How strange is this talisman that hath appeared and how wondrous this magic that hath been made manifest! They spend their entire lives consumed in the fire of search, yet when the Object of their quest appeareth they turn away from Him. They are seekers, yet recognize not their Goal. They are worshippers, yet remain deprived of the Worshipped One. They possess ears, yet in the Book of God are reckoned among the deaf. They have eyes, yet are numbered with the blind.\n\nThe friends of God must at all times beseech and supplicate the True One, exalted be His glory, for the deliverance of all, that perchance the people of the world may not remain deprived of this supreme bounty and may not be kept back from the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness by vain words, perishable ornaments, and transient colored conditions. The True One, exalted be His glory, is gracious and His grace is all-encompassing; He is merciful and His mercy is evident. After becoming acquainted with thy letter, this evanescent nonexistence did at a certain time repair to the eternal station and presented himself at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient, the Most Great\n\nO Muhammad-Qablil-Husayn! The servant present has come with thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One in this remote spot. We have chosen exile out of love for God, the Lord of all worlds, and have accepted imprisonment for the manifestation of His firm and wise Cause. There hath descended upon Us in the Most Great Prison that which hath caused the Concourse on High to weep, and the dwellers of Paradise and those who bear the Throne of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great, to lament. And there descended upon Us before this, in the Prison of Ta (Tihran), that which made the eyes of the Messengers weep. We came for their deliverance and upliftment, yet they have imprisoned Us time and again. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers! We summoned them to the supreme horizon, yet they barred Us from Our home and confined Us to the most dilapidated of dwellings. Thus was the matter decreed, and We are of those who give thanks. Blessed is he whom the affairs of creation have not prevented from turning, and he whom the power of the rulers hath not frightened from arising. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nYour honor hath been and continues to be the recipient of God's favors. Today is the day of steadfastness, and today is the day of goodly deeds. Through word and deed must all peoples be guided. Blessed is the soul that hath attained to the hearing of divine verses and hath perceived their sweetness. God willing, may the friends of Truth be assisted to serve the Cause and be enabled to do that which He loves and with which He is pleased.\n\nAs to what thou didst write regarding the visit, it was submitted, and He said that previously this word was revealed from the Supreme Pen regarding this land: \"Inwardly it is turbulent while outwardly calm. Soon shall its inward state manifest its outward condition, and its outward state its inward condition.\" For this reason and others We have forbidden those who drink from the Kawthar of meeting from turning towards this land. The Sun of Justice is veiled behind the clouds of oppression, as every just and discerning one doth testify. The true friends have been and are longing for attainment unto meeting, and God, exalted be His glory, hath loved the meeting of His friends, but countless veils have intervened. Your honor must in all conditions observe wisdom and hold fast to the cord of consultation. If wisdom permits and affairs are not hindered, permission for presence may be obtained. If they visit, there is and shall be no harm.\n\nPraise be to God, they have been illumined by the lights of the sun of permission, but in all conditions, as commanded, they must observe the requirements of circumstances and wisdom. Verily, He aids whomsoever He willeth and ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nConvey to the beloved Fuad who was mentioned in the letter - upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - this servant's greetings and salutations. Since they had written of their intention to travel, I did not wish to impose any special burden. God willing, in whatever land, station or realm they may be present, may they be engaged in the mention of God, the praise of God, and service to God's Cause. Praise be to God, they have been and continue to be thus engaged - blessed are they! I request that you convey greetings to all the friends on behalf of this servant. If wisdom permits, God willing, may every possessor of speech and utterance arise to teach and attain this most exalted and glorious station. Every pure deed that is manifested today from the friends of God is itself a teacher, and in most Tablets this comprehensive and binding word has been revealed. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from the Exalted Truth that He may confirm the assured and steadfast souls in that which today causes the exaltation of God's Word. Verily the All-Knowing Lord is the Witness, the Hearer.\n\nYou mentioned Haji Ahmad - upon him be the Glory of God - and Aqa Mashhadi Ali and Aqa Khalil - upon them be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, they are remembered in the Most Exalted Court and have attained God's favors. I request that you convey special greetings to them on behalf of this servant.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the reply to Ibn-i-Dhabih - upon them be the Glory of God - this servant intended to express to them the degrees of sincerity and send them a letter. However, when mention was made of Jinab-i-Dhabih and his ascension in the presence of the Beloved of all possibility, there was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur that which diffused the fragrance of favor and mercy. But now, since no command has issued from the Source of Command, this servant has also paused. God willing, whatever has been revealed from the Supreme Pen regarding this great calamity will arrive together with this servant's letter. For now, convey greetings to them on behalf of this servant. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to console his family and enable them to be patient and forbearing. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Glory be upon you and upon him and upon those who have attained to this mighty and wondrous Day. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00675 ===\n\n=== START BH00676 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nYour letter dated the twelfth of Muharram al-Haram was received and attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. His blessed and exalted Word: O Amin, your letter arrived and was presented by this servant. In truth, the sapling of existence has drunk from the waters of divine love. This is among the great bounties of the Truth, exalted be His glory. The rain of divine outpourings and the rays of the Sun of inner meanings have showered and shone upon all, yet all remain heedless save whom thy Lord willeth. O Abu'l-Hasan, the Lord of the hidden and the manifest declareth: O people of earth! Today the Mount hath attained the presence of its Interlocutor and the Lote-Tree hath reached its planting place. Blessed is the soul that heareth and findeth, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nAll that was in the correspondence from before and after is correct and acceptable, and whatever was \\[given\\] to any soul, before the Divine Presence a special course is destined. The Supreme Pen beareth witness to the trustworthiness and truthfulness of My Name Jamal, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and you yourself have also testified, and he has ever spoken well of the friends of God. Nevertheless, some in the land of Ta have accused him - God forbid - of treachery. This is naught but a grievous sin. Beseech and implore the Composer of hearts and the Sovereign of existence that the few souls who have been blessed by the Supreme Pen may arise with complete unity, love and dedication to teach the Cause and aid it. This matter is essential and obligatory, and without it there is no salvation. In discord there is remote, remote impossibility, and in unity the horizons become illumined. In this matter, mighty effort is required.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the friends in Nun, Jim, Alif, Ra and other lands, each has been mentioned by the Beloved of the world, and from the ocean of divine verses there hath been revealed concerning them that which maketh all the seas of the world appear as but a drop compared to a drop thereof. Beseech the Truth that they may preserve this most exalted station and not be silenced by the croaking of the croakers, the atheists and the deniers. May each be as a fire in the love of God upon a mountain and like the sun at the pole of heaven. And as for what reached Sheikh Muhammad Arab, it is necessary, nay obligatory, that he be looked after according to capacity by the Afnan and yourself.\n\nRegarding the sum of 70 tumans mentioned by Jinab-i-Haydar-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, who wrote from the Land of Ta, there are in that land certain steadfast souls who have turned to God, and it is hoped that they will be confirmed and assisted in paying the Huququ'llah. Therefore, from the direction of the Supreme Pen this firm command is issued: if they succeed, let them deliver the amount of seventy to the oppressed ones in the Land of Mim, that is, to the relatives of the Martyr, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Blessed is he who has been or will be assisted in this. Otherwise, God, exalted be His glory, is sanctified above what has been and is mentioned, and is above the world and its treasures. Whatever He commands, its fruits return to the servants themselves. Soon they shall see that which the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken before and will speak hereafter. And even if they present it with the utmost joy and fragrance and complete humility and submissiveness, O Amin, reflect upon the cotton-carders: from the beginning of their acceptance until now, they have arisen to serve the Goal of all the worlds with perfect steadfastness, love, joy and fragrance, to such an extent that the tongues of the people of God on earth speak their praise and the tongues of the Concourse on high in heaven proclaim their attributes. Exalted, exalted is this mighty and impregnable station! Ask God to increase their bounties at all times. Verily thy Lord is powerful over all things. Now if anyone in the Land of Ta is enabled to do so, take it and send it; if not, then let it be. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who act according to what they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nPraise be to God! Through the effusions of the Most Exalted Pen - may my spirit and the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of the Cause be a sacrifice unto Him - you have attained. Some time ago the glad tidings of His gracious presence were given, and surely you have attained unto them. In these days there has been no new news except that Mr. Muhammad Ibrahim and Haji Ghulam-'Ali - upon them be the glory of God - arrived, stayed for several days, and then, as commanded, returned to their homelands.\n\nThis evanescent servant ever beseeches and implores God, exalted be His glory, to protect His loved ones from the evil of the oppressors, the cawing ones, the doubts of the suspicious ones and the atheists. The key of grace and bounty is in His mighty grasp - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\n\nConsider how all the Shi'ih divines - may God forsake them - arose in opposition and issued the verdict for the execution of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. Day and night, they and their followers busied themselves with cursing, execration and charges of unbelief, while the cotton-carders, despite them, crossed the bridge and partook of the choice sealed wine. May God protect the people from the evil of the divines.\n\nThe purpose of knowledge is the benefit of God's servants, and this has ever been and will continue to be the crafts and trades. He has ever said and continues to say: \"Know ye the value of the craftsmen, for they have been and continue to be the cause and means for facilitating affairs.\" The foundation of religion is made firm through God's Law, and the foundation of livelihood through the craftsmen. By knowledge is meant that knowledge whose benefits reach humanity, not knowledge that leads to pride, arrogance, plunder, oppression, tyranny and pillaging.\n\nMerely upon mention of the name of one of the people of truth before that group, they immediately issue the verdict of unbelief, plunder and death for that helpless one. By the life of my Purpose and thy Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and earth, that misguided and misleading sect - namely the Shi'ih - committed that which neither the Jews, nor the Magians, nor even the idolaters have done the like. God protect us and you from the evil of these people and from the evil of the people of the Bayan who have violated the Covenant and who walk in their footsteps and say what their desires command them. Verily they are among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.\n\nI convey greetings and salutations to the friends in every land and beseech God to strengthen and protect them all, that they may not be afflicted with the vain imaginings of the past, and that through Ja'far and his sons Ahmad and others they may not be kept back from God's straight path. Reflect upon the fabrications of the Shi'ih sect: for one thousand two hundred years they called the truthful one a liar, and the heedless people called the son of the Imam and the brother of the Imam himself a liar, and they were unaware. And all these things came to pass through the word of one like Ibn-i-Ja'far. That which befell the world, befell it. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - was martyred through the word of that vile one and two or three others like him, for they ruled that whosoever says the Qa'im is in the loins and must be born is an infidel whose killing is obligatory. Thus did that occur whereat the atoms of all created things wept. They judged contrary to what God had revealed in the Book\\[...\\]\n\nWe beseech God to deal with them according to His justice, not His grace. Enough trouble has been given; I shall not further impose upon that Beloved One and shall end this letter with these words: Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have arisen to aid the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. And praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nThe Servant\n\n15th of the month of Safar 1303\n\nMultiple petitions have reached the Most Holy Court from Eliyahu. According to the Command, either something should be given to him so that he may be freed from debt and proceed to another land, or some occupation should be arranged for him. O Amin, although thou art poor, I know thy Lord is also poor, meaning He is sanctified from earthly ornaments. By the life of God! The treasures of the world are as non-existent and null before one drop from the ocean of His riches. Be thou assured. Verily thy Lord is the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The glory from Us be upon thee, and I am the Remembering, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00676 ===\n\n=== START BH00677 ===\n\nHe is God, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting\n\nThis is the Book wherein there is no doubt, sent down in truth from the presence of One Wise and All-Informed. It guideth mankind unto the precincts of an exalted mercy and causeth them that are detached to enter upon the shore of the ocean wherefrom branched forth the seas of names - this being of the grace that hath encompassed all the worlds. It giveth the unitarians to drink from the Euphrates of God's loving-kindness and raiseth up the oppressed unto the court of an all-glorious Name. Say: O people! We had forsaken this Cause at the time We entered into this station wherein no cry was raised from Us to anyone, and We remained quiet in the prison, silent from every wondrous mention. We had closed the gates of utterance upon the tongue, and thus were We for many days. We made mention of God in the secret of secrets with a hidden and mysterious tongue, until the days passed and the nights elapsed while We were in this condition which none among all the people could comprehend.\n\nThen did the Herald call out from every near direction: \"Arise, O servant, from thy slumber, then remind the servants of what God hath taught thee, and be not obstinate in the Cause. Art thou grieved by what hath befallen thee at the hands of these oppressors? This is of My ways, and for My way there is no alteration or change. Hast thou forgotten God's covenant when thou didst covenant with Him, before the creation of all contingent things in the particles of eternity, that thou wouldst be martyred in His path? This, verily, was an inevitability decreed in the Mother Book. Raise, then, thy head from the couch of quiet and tarry not in helping thy Lord, even though God is independent of the help of one such as thee. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee, neither be thou distressed by what the misguided ones have falsely alleged against thee. God sufficeth thee as a helper and supporter.\"\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! By Thy might, I yearn to lay down my life in Thy path, at every morn and eve. By Thy glory, O my God, were Thine enemies to slay me at every moment, the fire of my love for Thee would not be quenched; nay, it would increase with each passing instant, and Thou art well aware of this. For this do I thank Thee, and complain not to Thee of them, for they have denied Thee and Thy signs, and have failed to recognize Thy Cause which hath dawned from the horizon of wisdom. All this they do openly, without any veil or covering, whether thick or thin.\n\nBut those who claim to love Thee yet turn away from Thy beauty - this is grievous to me and to all who are nigh unto Thee. They act thus despite Thy having counseled in all Tablets, nay in every beauteous line, that they should not turn away from Thy verses when revealed in truth, nor close their eyes to the beauty of Thy glorious majesty. It is as though Thou hadst revealed the Bayan solely to guide them to Thy proofs, yet they have turned away from Thee and turned to their own selves, and Thou art aware of all this. Would that they were content with this! But they have spoken concerning me that which no believer would speak of even the most wretched transgressor. Through all this have I remained patient in the path of Thy love. Thus hast Thou made me, O my God, a target for the swords of these two factions, and I know not what to do hereafter, and Thou art witness to their deeds.\n\nYet by Thy presence, I grieve not for myself, but for Him Whose appearance Thou hast promised unto Thy servants in the latter resurrection. Oh, what sorrow I feel for Him in this day, and for what shall befall Him at the hands of those who claim faith for themselves and who imagine themselves unique in their belief. They shall oppose Him as they have opposed me, and this is clear proof and testimony thereof.\n\nBy Thy might, O my Beloved, We find none with vision to behold Thy signs with their own eyes. Rather, they see through the eyes of their leaders, affirm what they affirm, and deny what they deny, though Thou didst strictly forbid them from this. By Thy glory, O my God, I have found no word of truth from these people, nor any spiritual movement. They walk in the valley of desires and commit all manner of transgressions and evil deeds. This they do in secret, while in public they speak Thy praise and occupy themselves with Thy glorification at every sunrise and sunset.\n\nWhen one appears with clear signs, they draw against him the swords of their souls, hearts, and tongues, striking without delay or hesitation. They have forgotten all that Thou didst command in the Book, though but few days have passed since Thy time. They have reached such a state of pride and heedlessness that they recognize God's grace, signs, and proof, then deny them, thus showing their rebellion against Thy presence. Yet they consider themselves among those who are trustworthy with God's messages.\n\nO my God, by Thy might! No spot remaineth in my body that hath not been struck repeatedly by the swords of Thine enemies. Hearest Thou not the cry of the oppressed, O Thou Who holdeth in Thy grasp the reins of all the worlds? Wilt Thou not answer him who calleth upon Thee? Wilt Thou not dispel the afflictions of this poor, wretched soul whom Thou hast placed at the mercy of all, both high and low? Wilt Thou not stay the hands of the oppressors from my person, when Thou assuredly hast power over all things? When such as these exist in Thy realm, wherefore didst Thou manifest me amongst them and inspire me, O my God, with these words which have aroused such rancor in their hearts that their very hearts and limbs are well nigh torn asunder? And verily Thou encompasseth all things. It is as though they desired naught save to preserve their leadership, which they have seized through their own devices.\n\nThey became joyous within themselves and led those who followed them in heedlessness to such a state that were they to behold the gleaming lights, they would ask if the light was luminous, and were the Sun of Eternity to shine upon them, they would examine a dung beetle and ask if the sun was radiant. Therefore, open your eyes, O concourse of the heedless! These are the lights of the Sun that have encompassed your backs, your right, your left, above you, below you, your south and north. Therefore, O my God, what am I to do with them, and what is the fruit of my appearance amongst these people after Thou hast caused them to stand in the land of limitation while Thou hast elevated me to a station where the hands of unity fall short of reaching? Moreover, how can my Cause accord with their condition? Therefore, O my God, purify the hem of my robe from their clinging, then occupy them with that to which they are attached and with which they are content.\n\nThus am I left, O my God, alone in Thy land and solitary in Thy realm, with no one walking upon this path which is truly straight. How often in the evening, O my God, have mine eyes turned toward the direction of Thy grace and the dawn of Thy relief and bounties, yet found no rising of the morn of Thy gifts. How often in the morning, O my God, have mine eyes watched for a glance of Thy providence and favors, yet witnessed no appearance of the sun of Thy generosity and benevolence.\n\nHow long, O my God, wilt Thou not have mercy upon Thy servant whom none of Thy creatures would show mercy to, and who has spent his life imprisoned in their midst? Praise be unto Thee, O my God, in all of this, and I beseech Thee for patience in what Thou hast decreed and wilt decree, that I may be numbered among the patient ones recorded in the Tablets.\n\nThen I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name through which sorrow is transformed into joy, hardship into ease, and darkness into light, that Thou mayest send down, O my God, at this moment that which will dispel our sorrows and sever us from all else besides Thee, O Thou in Whose hand are bounty and benevolence, and the dominion of might and forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, and verily, Thou art wise over all things.\n\nHe is the Mighty\n\nThe mysteries of God have ever been and will forever remain hidden in the veils of the unseen, especially this Cause, whose essence has been concealed and protected, and none has comprehended it save God, thy Lord. For this reason, this divine Lote-Tree and manifest yet hidden mystery has endured from both friends and foes that which no pen or ink can recount, as thou hast been informed of some of these matters. Thou must now strive with utmost diligence to promote the Cause of God, though verily thy Lord is independent of all the worlds. In all circumstances, keep thy gaze fixed upon the root of the Cause and whatsoever appeareth from Him, ever mindful of all the friends, whether among the emigrants or those who remained, all of whom are present before Us.\n\n=== END BH00677 ===\n\n=== START BH00678 ===\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice for your love and a sacrifice for your service! After visiting your letter which was in truth a dawning-place of joy and a dayspring of delight, it was presented before the Throne and all was laid before His countenance. In truth, the sweet fragrances of the Beloved were wafting from that blessed letter. No other proof or evidence is needed - the very verses sent down from the heaven of Divine Will bear witness to the Most Great Bounty and the Supreme Favor. Therefore you must at all times praise the Beloved of all possibility with the utmost joy and delight. This servant, after the revelation of these exalted verses, with faltering tongue expressed on your behalf our nothingness, evanescence and unworthiness of these infinite divine bestowals, and with a hundred thousand tongues I offer thanks to the Beloved of the world, for He has manifested the perfection of favors toward you. Verily the servant thanks Him with the tongue of all things, the atoms of the world, and the sands of the desert, and with a hundred thousand expressions of powerlessness and supplication I beseech that it may find acceptance with God. In any case, the Divine bounty toward you has been and will be greater than what this evanescent one can mention. For each of the names that was in your letter, one after another, wondrous and exalted verses were revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful's favor and were sent. God willing, may they reach their recipients that they may drink from the Salsabil of revelation and receive their portion from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful's utterance. Happy are they! For some of the souls mentioned, Divine Tablets were sent repeatedly and successively, and specifically for Mulla 'Ali-Jan, one wondrous and exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of utterance and was previously sent. However, it is strange that some souls are very eager and diligent in obtaining Tablets meant for the divine loved ones, and after obtaining them deliver some while keeping others. I beseech God to enable all to be trustworthy and honest. Alas, alas! Then alas, alas! The servant's eye weeps for what has befallen the temple of \\[trustworthiness\\] among the people. Were I permitted, I would mention that which would cause the world to lament, but conceal and be patient. Verily my Lord is the Concealer, the Patient, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nAnd another submission is that the response to the petition of Maneckji Sahib has descended from the heaven of divine will and been sent. And since it was revealed in the Persian tongue, perchance it may influence some and its fruits become manifest. This servant has written a copy of it in clear script and sent it, so that any of the friends who wish may make copies from it, allowing the original Tablet to reach its recipient without defect or flaw. In any case, if copies are made, corrected, and given to some, perhaps it will bear fruit. But in all circumstances act with wisdom. I swear by the fragrance of His garment that if all people were receptive, this one Tablet alone would suffice. And regarding what you wrote about whether to move openly or remain concealed, it was submitted before the throne and He said concealment is better and you will be more at ease. It is strange that people have not yet realized that the Dawning Place of divine revelation and the Dayspring of the Lord's Cause has never intended corruption, conflict and contention. Would that they could perceive even an atom's weight of the fragrance of God's will! In that case they would surely know that what He has willed is more precious than red sulfur and more exalted than all that exists on earth. Since they have not caught a whiff from the rose garden of God's will, they oppose the friends of Truth out of fear for themselves. In all matters and circumstances keep your gaze fixed on wisdom. It is not fitting for anyone to speak an improper word regarding the government at this time. In truth, considering the opposition of the clergy and the hardness that has seized those souls, His Majesty the Sultan has conducted himself very well. In any case, the government shows consideration for the people of the nation, as undertaking anything that would cause general public disturbance has never been and is not acceptable to the government, for it must preserve its throne and sovereignty. This much has been clear to your honor, that in the Most Great Scene mention was made of the Sultan favorably. If one of these oppressive clerics were to become sultan, then the worth of all sovereigns would become clear and evident to you. Would that you could see Sheikh Hussein, the oppressor and oppressed one of Shiraz - one whose name is \"oppressed\" but from whose evil and tyranny hundreds of thousands of oppressors have sought and seek refuge in God. Thus does your Lord speak to you and jest that you may rejoice, and that every insightful servant may rejoice.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning Muhammad-Taqi, yes, he arrived and attained the Most Holy Presence for several days, and at the time of his departure, He specifically told him: \"Be vigilant lest the satans take you from the highest heaven to the lowest depths\" - this was the essence of the blessed words. Now this servant hopes he will return. If anyone sees him, let them say: \"You are a servant of God and I am a servant of God. In utmost poverty and nothingness I say, I swear by the Sun of Sanctity that you were confused and deceived, and I beseech you to return and associate for a time with those souls in that land, but with complete insight until what is hidden from you becomes clear.\" Today you reached that station but were not aware. This servant was with Him for twelve years and engaged in His service by God's command. Would that you had been with me and known what I knew. These few words were mentioned for God's sake that perchance you might not exchange the pure wine for the murky cup. The command is in God's hand - He gives to drink and withholds. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nAs to what you wrote asking whether previous petitions had received replies - whatever has descended from the heaven of grace, before, after and during, will suffice for all. And concerning what you wrote about the fiery Tablets he brought for some - if those same Tablets' owners would reflect upon them, they would testify to the writer's heedlessness and would become aware.\n\nThe mention of Ali-'Askar and Shir-'Ali and Mirza that was at the end of your letter was presented, and divine favors were manifest and dawning in relation to each one. We beseech God to assist them, make them successful, and grant them the best of what lies with Him. Verily He is the Generous Giver.\n\nAs commanded, you must strive greatly to keep matters concealed and in sending mail, for if the internal and external satans discover that news arrives from the Most Holy Presence, they will surely cause mischief, and perhaps some may be moved to attempt service in their imagination and inform certain princes and ministers hoping to gain favor. In any case, concealment is necessary and obligatory, and this has been and will be the main reason for delay in responding to petitions. If some way could be found to keep this matter concealed, wondrous and novel Tablets would always be sent specifically for the friends.\n\nAnother submission: Convey the Most Glorious Ancient Greeting from this evanescent servant to the friends of God - those souls who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and have drunk from the wine of steadfastness. The son of His Honor A.T., upon him and his father be the Glory of God, whose mention was in your letter - countless greetings from this servant dependent on your favors are extended to him. Likewise to Karbila'i Mahdi and the other friends, upon them be the Glory of the All-Merciful. And the Most Glorious Glory be upon you and those with you. The people of the pavilion of divine protection remember your honor with the most wondrous, exalted and glorious mentions and greet you with the most impregnable, holy greeting. Similarly all the friends in the Prison Land, one and all, express their sincere greetings to your honor.\n\nThe Servant\n\n25 Ramadan 1295\n\n=== END BH00678 ===\n\n=== START BH00679 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty!\n\nImmeasurable praise befitteth the peerless and incomparable One Who hath illumined the dawning-points of the hearts of those who have turned towards Him with the lights of the Sun of Divine Unity, and Who hath drawn receptive realities through the magnet of His Creative Word. He is the Omnipotent One Whom no matter can hinder in His power and no thing can prevent His all-encompassing Will from penetrating. Through His pure grace and mercy He hath caused the Sun of Truth to appear in the world and guided those who had lost their way in the wilderness of ignorance and perplexity to the dayspring of grace and favor. Blessed is the soul that hath in this great Day attained unto the recognition of this mighty Cause and found its way to the straight path.\n\nO thou who hast quaffed the crystal waters of divine knowledge in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, who art illumined by the lamp of the knowledge of the Lord of all possibilities, and who dwellest beneath the shade of the Tree of divine grace, the Mighty, the Help in Peril! Thy letter, which bore expressions of love and reflected the subtleties of intimacy and unity, became the cause of joy and gladness. Praise and thanksgiving be unto God that thou art engaged in service to His Cause and art arising to assist it. This is a bounty that hath had no peer or likeness in the divine worlds, for it is the key to the treasures of generosity and favor, and the cause of the manifestation of the subtleties of grace and mercy. It behooveth thee to thank Him at all times with every expression and tongue.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about the letter 60, we beseech God to acquaint him with that which will benefit him and others. In truth, man is unaware of what is beneficial for him unless he is aided by the confirmations of his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. These matters have been discussed repeatedly and were explained in such a way as would suffice any thoughtful and discerning person. We hope that God, exalted be His glory, will guide all to that which is the cause of success and pure righteousness and prosperity. Verily, He is the Gracious, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nAs for what thou didst mention concerning the arrival of him who turned away, reflect upon past ages and bygone centuries. Those who were greater in station and mightier in person arose to extinguish the light of God, yet found themselves in manifest loss. Where are Pharaoh and his hosts, Nimrod and his armies, Abu Jahl and his ignorance and his remoteness from the knowledge of God and his heedlessness? Should all who are on earth arise to extinguish this Light that shineth from the horizon of Sinai, and should they assist one another and grasp at every means, they shall find themselves in evident loss, and the Cause will remain God's, the Lord of all worlds. It is most clear that even if the whole world should unite and strive with utmost effort to extinguish this Fire, they shall surely find themselves powerless. The Fire that hath been kindled by divine power in the world of existence shall never be extinguished by the winds of the vain imaginings of heedless souls, nor shall it be quenched by the waters of the doubts and intimations of deluded forms. Yea, every Cause hath an appointed time for its manifestation in the world of existence. When its time cometh, the standards of the Cause shall be raised, and the believers shall say: The dominion belongeth unto God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned concerning the deception of the veiled ones and their dissembling, and their striving to conceal the Cause through their vain imaginings - this is their way and the way of those who follow them, and this befits them and those who walk in their footsteps. The way of the people of certitude is to remain steadfast on the path of divine knowledge and to stand firm in the Cause of their Lord, the Sovereign of all religions. By thy life! Through their steadfastness are broken the backs of the people of vain imaginings, and severed are the cords of hope of the idol-worshippers. I beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to adorn His loved ones with the ornament of steadfastness and to establish them firmly upon the path of divine knowledge. Steadfastness is a shield that rendereth ineffective the swords of tyranny and oppression and the arrows of vain imaginings. Blessed is he who is adorned with its robe and armed with its weapons. He hath indeed achieved salvation and caused others to be saved, and hath attained unto good in this world and the next.\n\nRegarding what was written about the question of the veiled ones and its answer - assuredly whatever is mentioned of such matters and whatever comprehensive and sufficient answer is given is most beneficial and profitable. We hope that thou wilt ever be successful and confirmed in all circumstances, and arise to celebrate the praise and serve the Cause of the Lord of all names. After thy letter was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, and mention was made of that beloved one, the tongue of bounty spoke these resplendent words - exalted be His utterance and magnificent His favor:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy! Thou hast ever been blessed with the mention, praise, bounty and grace of the True One, exalted be His glory. This is a great bounty - know thou its worth. I swear by the light of the Day-Star of Utterance which shineth from the highest horizon of the world that the worthless ones of the earth and the weak-natured ones of this world were not and are not worthy to hear this utterance. For twelve hundred years they were worshippers of vain imaginings, and the people of the Bayan, despite having witnessed with their own eyes the deeds and actions of those souls and their fruits on the Day of Judgment, again clung to the same vain imaginings. All testify that not a single one of the divines, from the inception of Islam until now, was aware of the nature of His appearance. The eyes, both outer and inner, were fixed and gazing upon the mythical Jabulqa while the Countenance of the Desired One appeared from the womb of His mother in Persia. The power of God made manifest the loss of all. Now Hadi of Dawlatabad, through names and past vain imaginings, hath in his own estimation established the straight path. Shame upon him, his fidelity, his knowledge and his understanding! Say: Be fair, by God! Look at what hath been sent down in truth and be not of the wrongdoers. By God's life! What hath been revealed in this Revelation is not equaled by what was revealed in the past. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning one, and every learned and informed one. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy word concerning this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord and my Hope! With what tongue can I make mention of Thee in a manner worthy of Thy sanctified court, and with what utterance can I thank Thee in a way befitting the gate of Thy detachment? By Thy glory, I see my pen powerless to render thanks for even the least of Thy favors, and my tongue unable to express praise for the manifestations of Thy bounty and generosity. Through pure grace and bestowal, Thou hast made known to us that which remained hidden from the learned and the mystics, and which was denied by the divines and the eloquent. This is solely through Thy might and power and Thy grace and mercy; else who is capable of knowing Thy Cause as it is, and who can comprehend Thy Manifestation as Thou art? I beseech Thee to assist us in raising the banners of gratitude and praise amidst all created things, and to grant us the Kawthar of steadfastness in Thy Cause and the Salsabil of firmness in the path of Thy love. Enable us to teach Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance throughout the contingent world and to guide the followers of all religions to the city of knowledge and understanding. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Triumphant, the Glorious, the Helper. Preserve, O my God, those who love Thee and who have arisen to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, who have devoted themselves to the service of Thy Cause in the cities of Thy creation. Honor them at all times with the robes of Thy bounty and generosity, and aid them in that which they desire. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the Everlasting, the Most High, the Most Great. O Lord! Thou seest those who are heedless of Thy remembrance and are veiled from the effulgent rays of the Sun of Thy Revelation, wandering in the wilderness of allusions and bewildered in the desert of veils. I beseech Thee, by Thy pure power, to manifest in the kingdom that which will draw all unto the court of Thy knowledge and bring them near to the city of Thy wisdom and knowledge. They are Thy servants and are in the grasp of Thy power. They know not what profiteth them and what harmeth them. I beseech Thee to make known to them that which is best for them in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Moreover, remember and glorify the friends of God who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and who utter His praise and remembrance with pleasing words and exalted glorifications. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon the steadfast servants of God, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. 202\n\n=== END BH00679 ===\n\n=== START BH00680 ===\n\nJinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-i-Milani, upon him be the Glory of God\n\nIn the blessed month of Ramadan 1299\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, and His is the might, the grandeur and the dominion. He sendeth down what He willeth and withholdeth from whom He willeth. His Most Exalted Pen hath appeared and through it He hath ordained for whomsoever He desireth whatsoever He desireth. He is the Interpreter, Whom the All-Merciful hath described and made to move among the religions. Exalted is the Desired One Who hath come with the truth and hath spoken that which was the pure wine of divine knowledge for all who dwell within the realm of possibility. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd now, thy letter was received which, praised be God, was adorned with the sweet-scented breeze of the Beloved of the worlds. This evanescent servant hath ever mentioned and continueth to mention the friends of God. They have always been and remain before mine eyes. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid them and enable them to achieve that which is the cause and means of drawing near unto Him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nAfter perusing and becoming acquainted with the contents of thy letter, this servant turned towards the most holy, most exalted Court and presented a detailed account. These sublime words were revealed and sent down from the Dawning-Place of divine favors, the Source of verses. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\n\"O 'Ali! The whole world hath been created for the knowledge of God, yet most are deprived of recognizing the Ocean of His Revelation. Whosoever hath today attained unto this supreme gift must render thanks unto God, exalted be His glory, throughout the endurance of His earthly and heavenly kingdoms. This dependeth upon divine grace and assistance. We counsel all the friends to that which is the cause of progress and the means of elevation. Jinab-i-Alif and Ha and all other friends are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. God willing, may they be assisted through His grace to achieve goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Man is like unto a sword, and its essence is forbearance and godliness. So long as it remaineth sheathed in the scabbard of self, its true quality remaineth unknown. Supplicate God, exalted be His glory, that He may enable all to attain unto the station of maturity, which is the station of certitude and divine knowledge. From this station We send Our greetings upon thee and upon My loved ones who have turned unto Me and have attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds.\" The Word hath ended.\n\nPraise be to God that thou hast been favored with divine grace, for thy mention hath repeatedly been made in the Most Holy Court. This is a great bounty; were its station to be made manifest, all would be amazed.\n\nA letter from Haji 'Ali-'Askar, upon him be the Glory of God, reached this servant. After perusing it, it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court. He said: \"May he, God willing, be assisted in that which God loves.\" That which was indicative of the favor of God, exalted be His glory, was revealed specifically for him. Verily We have mentioned him and will mention him, and We counsel him to show forth the greatest steadfastness in this mighty Cause. The people of the world have been prevented from recognizing God, exalted be His glory, and turning towards Him by the promptings of self and desire. Blessed is the soul who has today drunk from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful and attained that which was intended. Praise be to God in all conditions. The friends must today know their worth and preserve their stations through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. Verily, He is the Preserver, the Observer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily God has forgiven thy father and thy mother. He is indeed the Forgiver, the Mighty, the Generous. Rejoice thou in thy Lord's favor, then render thanks unto Him at morn and eventide. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nGod willing, may you ever be blessed with the outpourings of the ocean of inner meanings and be confirmed in that which God loves. This evanescent servant at all times beseeches assistance and favor from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted, on behalf of the friends, especially those friends who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. I request that you convey my greetings to the friends of God.\n\nLikewise, mention was made of Aqa Muhammad-Rida at the Most Holy and Exalted Court, and these words were revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful's favor concerning him. His exalted Word: \"O Rida! We have heard thy call and beheld thy turning and attraction, and We make mention of thee with these sublime words that thou mayest, with the utmost joy and gladness, engage in the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory, in this Day of Manifestation. Contingent existence is observed to be like unto a mirage, or like the remnant of the sun's reflection upon the mountains which will soon be overtaken by extinction. Blessed is the soul that in these blessed days has attained unto that from which the fragrance of eternity is wafted. Heedlessness hath encompassed the world. All are seen to be clinging to that which is transient and deprived of that which is everlasting, save whom God willeth. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued what was and what will be, to ordain for me that which befitteth Thy bounty and Thy generosity, and to decree for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the One with power over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThat which was mentioned by Karbila'i 'Ali -- upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory -- those very passages were presented before His presence. He said: \"The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison. He is the All-Seeing, He heareth and answereth, and He is the Hearing, the Responding One. As to thy request from God, exalted be His glory, for true vision, praise be to God, this desire was granted even before being expressed. For hadst thou not possessed true vision, thou wouldst have been found heedless of the Truth, even as most of the world's people -- whether divines, rulers, or others -- are today deprived and unaware. How many kings today remove their hats at the mention of one of God's names, yet remain deprived of, barred from, and heedless of God, exalted be His glory, Who is the Creator of names and their Quickener. Whosoever hath today attained unto the recognition of God is and shall be regarded as the most exalted of all creation in the sight of the Truth. Blessed are they who have attained unto this most exalted station. Soon shall the station of those who have turned unto Him become evident and manifest to all others. We beseech God to assist thee in that which causeth steadfastness, the manifestation of grace, and service to His Cause.\"\n\nRegarding what thou didst write about journeying to the Holy Land, thou hast permission, but He said: \"Be patient, for verily He is with His patient servants.\" Praise be to God that thou didst attain unto His presence and drink from the cup of meeting. At present, due to the upheavals in these parts, such a journey is not permitted. He commandeth thee with that which is best for thee. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nConcerning the sum thou didst write about, let nine tumans thereof be delivered to Nabil-i-Akbar -- upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory -- who is in the Land of Ta \\[Tehran\\], that he may, on behalf of the Truth, host the friends of God. The remainder should be given to Muhammad-'Ali from the Land of Sad. This evanescent servant beseecheth God that He may shelter beneath His grace those souls who have turned to Him and remained steadfast, as well as those who act according to what hath been revealed in the Book and pay the Rights of God.\n\nO my God, my Hope, my Beloved, and my Desire! I beseech Thee to assist the servants of Thy path in benevolent matters. In this matter, bestow Thy special grace upon the giver, the recipient, the partaker, and the one who administers. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nPraise be to God, all the names mentioned in thy letter have been blessed with special favors, and for each one, clear verses have been revealed from the heaven of grace. His is the praise and the bounty. Ever are those who turn unto Him, the sincere ones, the unitarians, those who remember Him, those who seek Him, and those who hope in Him -- all are mentioned before His presence and are blessed with infinite favors. May God, exalted be His glory, assist all to recognize this Most Great Station. The Glory be upon thee and upon those whose names thou didst mention before His presence, and upon every one who hath turned unto Him and remained steadfast. And praise be to God, the Single, the All-Knowing.\n\n=== END BH00680 ===\n\n=== START BH00681 ===\n\nThe Most Glorious One witnesses His friends and guides them all to the straight path. Today the straight path is manifest and the hidden mystery that was forever concealed in the divine treasuries of infallibility is now evident. Blessed are they whom the outward circumstances of the world and its ornaments have not deprived of the Most Exalted Horizon. The waves of the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance have reached their highest surge, and the horizon of the world is illumined and radiant with the lights of the Greatest Luminary, yet the various sects and heedless souls remain deprived and forbidden. Those servants who considered themselves the most exalted, most excellent and most learned of all creation, on the Day of Manifestation prevented people from turning to the Truth and encouraged them to turn away. These are the ones who, throughout all ages and centuries, have done to the Manifestations of God's Cause and the Dawning Places of His Divine Revelation that which caused grief and sorrow to the world. By God's life! Had the Sources of Divine commandments not been saddened, you would have beheld all the world rejoicing. From the sorrow of those holy souls, the fire of grief was kindled in the world and the light of joy was veiled.\n\nO Allah-Virdi! The Wronged One of the horizons mentions thee from this Most Great Prison, and likewise His loved ones - those souls who have drunk from the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting God and who are gazing toward and are turned to the Most Exalted Horizon. All must recognize the worth of this most exalted station and supreme rank, and must occupy themselves with the praise and glorification of the Peerless Beloved. They must hold fast to the cord of unity and cleave to the hem of concord, for through unity the light of the Cause will encompass the horizons and illumine hearts. Today the springtime of utterance hath made the world fresh and adorned, and the true door of inner meanings hath been opened in the name of the Divine \\[...\\]. All things and the Concourse on High speak in remembrance of the Lord of Names and make mention of His praise. Today every secret is made manifest and every hidden thing is revealed. The loved ones of God must arise with the utmost endeavor and striving to exalt the Word of God - an arising that neither the calumnies of the world nor the doubts of the nations can prevent.\n\nWe previously informed all of the braying of the brayerers who will soon pass through that land. These are the manifestations of Satan who, with the utmost cunning, deception, and outward humility and submissiveness, prevent the servants from the Dawning Place of the Light of Oneness. All must drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness and from the cup of assurance in such wise that the braying of the brayerers will not affect them. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and hold fast to that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen. Verily, He sufficeth you, by the Lord of all the worlds.\n\nWe counsel all to such deeds as will guide humanity and to such character as will deliver the servants from the wilderness of error. Religion is as a lamp, and trustworthiness is as a kind companion, and truthfulness is as a garment for the temple of man. The doer is known by his deeds, not his words. Deeds are as a mirror that telleth the story of the doers. Acceptable deeds are clearly distinguished from those that are rejected. Some, with perfect adornment, consider themselves superior to all creation, though they are not worthy of mention - they are as a straw before the fierce winds of self and passion, which carry them wheresoever they list. From the beginning of days until now, We have mentioned the servants with clear utterance \\[...\\]\n\nWe have imparted the Word and shown the Way, and commanded that which leads to success and prosperity. Blessed are they whose evil deeds have not prevented them from good and pure deeds. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One, and beseech God to protect you from the hosts of self and passion, and to aid you in that which befits His days.\n\nMuhammad and Muhammad attained the Most Holy Court and achieved that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. The first Muhammad twice partook of the cup of reunion, and the second once. Their reward is with God, their Creator. Every pure deed is a treasure for its doer with God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is he who has attained, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nThey mentioned the friends of that land, both men and women, and each has been blessed by God's favors. Some have sought permission for attainment of His presence. In these days this is not permitted, as the transgressors and idolaters lie in wait. However, for every soul who is today enkindled with the fire of divine love and stands firm on the path of His Cause, the Supreme Pen records for them, should God will and desire, the reward of attainment. O people of God! Strive that ye may achieve that which befits this most great bounty.\n\nFrom this station We send Our greetings upon you and upon those who have testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the creation of the heavens and earth. These are indeed among the triumphant in God's Book, the Lord of the worlds. They who have acted according to what God has revealed - these are the successful ones. And they who have held fast to the Book when it was sent down in truth - these are the near ones. O people of God! Take hold of God's Book with the strength that comes from Him, then act according to what is revealed therein. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, hears and sees, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who turned to the Most Glorious Horizon, who arose to serve his Lord, attained His presence, and drank the choice wine of life from the hands of His bounty. He was named Varqa in the Book of Names. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, to strengthen him, draw him nigh unto Him, and ordain for him what He has ordained for His chosen ones who were not frightened by hosts and multitudes. O Varqa! Hear the call of thy Lord, then remind the people of what has been sent down from God, the Lord of existence. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee. Set aside what the people possess and hold fast to the Book of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. He has remembered thee at this hour and adorned thy temple with the ornament of grace. Be thankful and say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and all glory be to Thee, O Thou the Beloved of all that was and shall be.\n\nWe make mention of Alif and Ha \\[Ahmad\\] who turned to the Countenance on a day wherein trembling seized the inhabitants of earth and the tribes wailed out of fear of God, the Lord of this promised Day. O Ahmad! Rejoice in My remembrance of thee, then thank thy Lord. We have remembered thee with that which nothing in all creation can equal, as attesteth He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. O Ahmad! Thank God for having enabled thee and thy sons to recognize the Dawning-Place of His verses, the Dayspring of His Cause, and the Manifestation of His Self, Whose appearance was heralded in God's Books of the past and future, and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur in this praiseworthy station. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon you, O My handmaidens, and upon every servant who has attained and every maidservant who has turned to and believed in God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO my God and my Lord! Thou seest Thy servants turning unto Thee, acknowledging Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and confessing that which Thou hast sent down unto them from the heaven of Thy Will and the clouds of Thy Purpose. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which all created things appeared and all contingent beings emerged, and through which the breezes of Thy bounty wafted over Thy creation and the streams of Thy mercy flowed amongst Thy servants, to aid them to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. Then inscribe, through Thy Most Exalted Pen, for the people of Sin and Ya and their surroundings that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. Then ordain for those who have lamented in their separation from Thee and cried out for reunion with Thee the recompense of meeting Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom the conditions of the world cannot frustrate. Strengthen the limbs of Thy loved ones to serve Thee. Thou art He to Whose power every possessor of a tongue hath testified, and to Whose sovereignty every person of grandeur hath confessed. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy command, and decreest what Thou desirest by Thy will. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. Within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\n=== END BH00681 ===\n\n=== START BH00682 ===\n\nThis hath been sent down for Muhammad, that he might praise his Lord and be numbered among them that render praise, mentioned in the Tablets of Glory. He is the Ever-Abiding, the Most Glorious.\n\nThis is a Book wherein is mentioned that which the Spirit hath inspired Me, and verily it is a revelation from God and a sign of His remembrance unto them who have acknowledged God and His verses. It guideth them unto the Path, and increaseth naught for the idolaters save manifest loss. This, verily, is the Path of God in the heavens and on earth, and His Hidden Book for them that are in the kingdom of Command and Creation, and His Treasured Scripture for them that are in the realm of the All-Glorious, and the Manifested Tablet for all who dwell on earth. Through it God's favor unto His creation is perfected, and His mercy encompasseth all worlds.\n\nO peoples of the earth! Hearken unto that which God teacheth you in the Tablets, and follow not the ways of the most abject. Do that which ye have been commanded in the Book, then shun the ways of the corrupt ones who, when they found Us possessed of sovereignty and power, said \"We believe in God and in what hath been sent down unto Thee,\" but when We entered prison they turned away and disbelieved, and were among the idolaters.\n\nSay: God hath dominion over His creation and is supreme above His creatures, and nothing escapeth His knowledge. He watcheth over every soul. Say: Do ye deny the verses of God after which, were God to erase their traces and remove what ye have been given of the verses, ye would find no way for yourselves, nor any guidance? Fear God, O people, and deny not the proof whereby ye have known the path of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nSay: O people! When We found you heedless of God's Cause and envious in your hearts, We departed from your midst and changed Our garment, that ye might rest in your places and not commit that which would cause the Cause to lose its sanctity and honor among the servants. Thus were We among the doers. Yet ye showed no shame, but rather imputed to the Beauty of the All-Merciful that which Satan had whispered in your hearts, and were among the slanderers. From you and from your pens came that from which the denizens of the heavens and earth declared themselves clear. Ye attributed every evil unto Me, though God had made Me sanctified above all things and purified from aught else but Him, and sent Me from the Dayspring of Holiness with manifest sovereignty.\n\nSay: Fear God! If ye believe not in Him and in the Manifestation of His Self, war not against Him, and be among the God-fearing. Attribute not what is within your souls unto the Self of God, and follow not the path of those who turned away from the Manifestations of the Cause and denied them until they slew them with grievous wrong.\n\nO people of Baha! Keep yourselves apart from such as these, and turn not unto a people with whom God is wroth and whom He hath seized with vengeance from His presence. He, verily, is the most severe in punishment. Hasten unto God's good-pleasure and His satisfaction, then take up your abode in the secure station of this mighty Stronghold. Beware that ye draw not nigh unto them who have denied all the verses, whose eyes are veiled from My remembrance, and whose ears are wrapped in coverings from hearkening unto My holy, wondrous Words.\n\nSay: When We found the earth of hearts barren of the vegetation of knowledge and wisdom, We then caused to descend from the clouds of grace that which made them stir and swell, bringing forth every noble kind. Rejoice, O people of the Bayan, in this Garden which hath appeared at the heart of Paradise, and deprive not yourselves of the wondrous knowledge ordained for you. I am but a servant who hath believed in God \\[...\\]\n\nI am but a servant who has believed in God and His verses, and I remind you of what God has inspired me through His grace, and guide you to the paths of those who are near. He who believes in Him and turns to God does so for his own sake, and he who turns away does so to his own detriment. My duty is but clear delivery of the Message. O people! By God, besides Whom there is no god, I have indeed sacrificed my soul and spirit for the Cause of God, my Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have raised the Cause to a station beyond the reach of the hands of harm and the hands of the idolaters. Thus has God established His Cause through His words and His sovereignty, and the deeds of the corrupt have been rendered vain. When my brother witnessed that the sun of certitude had dawned from the horizon of utterance through this Youth, Who stood at the center of all creation with the adornment of the All-Merciful, he emerged from behind the veil of concealment and rose up to war against the Beauty of the All-Glorious, becoming one of the antagonists. He pronounced against me what his self and passion commanded him. Then the hosts of victory descended from the direction of a mighty throne, and the vanguards of divine protection appeared from the horizon of glory. God thereby protected me in truth and aided me through the power of might and authority, and His victory was near to those who do good. When he found himself disappointed in what he desired and dejected in what he sought, he devised another stratagem, whereby all names were disturbed in their kingdoms, and all existence, both seen and unseen, wept at what befell my soul - and God was witness over him and me. When We found him in such a state, We departed from among them alone, relying upon God, the Powerful, the Almighty. When he saw that the Cause had become renowned among these emigrants who had believed, he wrote tablets to various lands wherein he mentioned what he had perpetrated, seeking thereby to instill hatred for the Youth in people's hearts. Would that he had been content with this and been among those who rest! Thereafter he complained about the Youth to every soul to cause confusion about the Cause among the servants, thereby violating my honor and the honor of God, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Wise. O people of the Bayan! Be fair within yourselves, speak with pure truthfulness, and be among the truthful ones. Most of you have associated with me and know my character - has anyone witnessed from me anything that would trouble their soul? No, by Him Who sent me with the truth, if you are among the fair-minded! I have been forgiving to the penitent, concealing toward the transgressor, merciful to the one who returns and repents, compassionate to the disappointed, and a refuge for the fearful - to this every fair-minded and discerning one bears witness. Is there anyone among you who would deny this bounty? No, by my true Self, except one who denies all God's favors and follows the paths of the deluded! Would one who desires neither harm nor sorrow for anyone desire harm for his brother? Therefore, investigate and be among those who speak the truth and do not transgress the decree of truthfulness, even if the swords of the idolaters should fall upon him. By God, the Truth! When my brother found that the hearts of the pure ones were filled with the love of God and the Manifestation of His Self, he desired to turn hearts away from the holy direction, after We had protected him for twenty years from the harm of every harmful one - and you were among the witnesses. Say: O people of the Bayan! Deny not what you have witnessed with your own eyes \\[...\\]\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Deny not what ye have witnessed with your own eyes, and follow not the paths of fancy. Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through the power of might bestowed by Us, then enter the paradise of certitude and be among those who rejoice therein. Thus have We informed you in brief concerning that which hath befallen Us, lest ye be heedless thereof and your feet slip from the path of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd thou, O servant, arise to serve the Cause of God and fear no one. Convey unto the people that which God hath conveyed unto thee through His messengers. He will verily protect thee from the harm of all peoples. Strive thou to purify thyself from the defilements of the world and to adorn thyself with the attributes of God, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful, the All-Seeing. Verily, if thou doest that which We have commanded thee, thou shalt become one who teacheth the people through deeds rather than words - and this is the most excellent teaching, if thou be of them that know.\n\nSay: O people of the earth! Come with deeds done purely for God, the True One. The days of words have passed and the time for deeds hath come. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Sovereign of all causes, if ye be of them that act.\n\nSay: O people! Be as the signs of God amongst His servants and His traces in His lands, that through you the face of His Cause may be illumined amongst all creation. Thus have We informed thee and counselled thee that thou mayest take counsel within thyself and counsel the people with that which thou hast been commanded by the All-Knowing Judge. May the mercy that hath encompassed all created things rest upon thee, that thou mayest remain steadfast in the Cause of thy Ancient Lord - thou and those that are with thee among them whom God hath brought forth from behind the veils of fancy and guided unto the shore of mighty certitude. Praise be unto Him Who guideth all the worlds to the paradise of His wondrous Name.\n\n=== END BH00682 ===\n\n=== START BH00683 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the All-Wise, the All-Eloquent!\n\nO Buzurg! The ocean of utterance has surged, yet the people perceive not. The fire has appeared in the Divine Lote-Tree and speaks with truth, yet the people understand not. The Herald has called out in the midst of heaven, yet the people hear not. The Light has shone forth from the horizon of Manifestation, yet most of the factions know not. The Interlocutor of the Mount has been established upon the throne of Revelation, yet the people turn away from Him. By God! The Promised One has come and speaks before all faces - blessed are they who recognize Him. The Truth has appeared and revealed whatsoever He willed, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Nothing escapes His knowledge, nor can the might of kings and subjects render Him powerless. He has arisen before the faces of the world with an authority that the Daysprings of justice and fairness cannot deny. To this bears witness the Pen of God in this praiseworthy station.\n\nSay: O people of the earth! Do you know Him Who mentions you from the direction of the Prison? Do you hear that which has been raised in truth from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be? By God's life! Had you known, you would have hastened to God, the Possessor of this witnessed Day. Say: Fear God and dispute not the signs of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Be fair in what has appeared and follow not every ignorant rejected one. The Desired One has come from the horizon of power with a Cause before which the world cannot stand, as you know. The might of the mighty cannot frustrate Him, nor can the power of princes prevent Him. He speaks at all times at the heart of possibility: \"Verily, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Supreme over what was and what shall be.\" Thus has surged the ocean of utterance while the Wronged One was in His mighty prison.\n\nO Buzurg! Rejoice in the favors of thy Lord and say: \"Praise be to Thee, O Desired One of the world and Beloved of the nations! I testify that Thou hast come from the heaven of proof with the banners of knowledge, such that neither the oppression of the aggressors, nor the turning away of the deniers, nor the learning of the learned, nor the power of princes could prevent Thee. Thou didst speak before all faces with the most exalted call: 'Verily, there is no God but I, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.'\"\n\nO Muhammad! Thou hast attained unto the mention of the Wronged One time and again. He remembers whoever remembers Him and turns to whoever turns to Him. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Hearken unto the call which has been raised from the blessed White Spot, the place wherein the atoms speak what the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken: \"The Kingdom belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds.\" We have remembered thee and those who have believed with a mention whose radiance shall never set, by the command of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have aided thee, taught thee, and made known to thee My manifest and straight path. How many a learned one has been prevented from recognizing Me, though he was created to serve My mighty and wondrous Cause! And how many a knowledgeable one have We adorned with the ornament of being, that he might appear and stand before My exalted gate! They were deprived of the greatest favor in the days of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. But thou hast attained unto acceptance and heard the call of thy Lord, the Lord of the end, while every remote scholar turned away. Thou hast witnessed in His path what the Wronged One witnessed. Nothing escapes His knowledge of what befell you from the hosts of the aggressors who denied God's grace and mercy and disbelieved in the Day of Judgment. We have forgiven thee and adorned thee with the ornament of acceptance, as a grace from My presence, and I am the Bountiful, the Generous. Preserve My verses, then recite them with the melodies of those near unto God and the songs of the sincere ones.\n\nWe make mention of the Martyr's wife, that Leaf whom We have mentioned in diverse Tablets, and all the handmaidens and servants whom God hath related to His Name - he who was martyred in His path, detached from all who are in the heavens and on earth. O My handmaidens and servants! Rejoice in God's remembrance in the Most Great Prison, then render thanks unto Him at all times. Upon you be My glory and the glory of them who are in My Kingdom and My Dominion, and the glory of those who circle round the Throne at dawn and at eventide.\n\nO Husayn! The Countenance of the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison, making mention of thee and counselling thee with that which beseemeth this glorious and wondrous Day. Thou hast attained unto the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and His gracious remembrance. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath remained faithful to God's Covenant and His Testament, when the people were wrapped in strange delusion. They worship idols and perceive it not; they deny Him Who hath been remembered throughout the nights and days, yet they understand not. They say that which causeth the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament, yet they comprehend not. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they perceive it not. O My Most Exalted Pen! Set aside mention of these and make mention of My loved ones, then forgive them as a token of My grace. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Forgiving.\n\nO companions of the Prison! Your Lord, the Most Merciful, maketh mention of you in recompense for what ye have witnessed in His path. Recognize this most exalted station, then give thanks unto Him throughout the nights and days, at eventide and at dawn. We have purified you with the water of grace and forgiven you as a mercy from Our presence, for We are the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Rejoice in that which the Tongue of the Ancient Beauty hath uttered, and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, for having remembered us in Thy Prison when Thou wert in the hands of those who denied the Witness and the Witnessed. And thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Lord of all names, for having sent down unto us that which shall never be exhausted throughout ages and centuries.\"\n\nO Rida! The Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of thee. By the life of God! Didst thou know the fruits of My remembrance and its effects, thou wouldst call upon thy Lord throughout the nights and days, and wouldst find thyself in a joy unequalled by any joy in the world, and in a delight that no delight in the seen or unseen can match. Verily, My remembrance is a tree We have planted with the hands of grace and bounty, and it hath fruits that perish not so long as the kingdom and the realm endure. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto it, for he hath attained unto all good in the Book of God, the Lord of all creation. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon thee and upon thy family, and We give you both glad tidings of God's tender care, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We manifested the pearls of wisdom from the ocean of the mercy of your Lord, the Possessor of all that was and shall be. And We make mention of My handmaiden who hath ascended unto God, and give her glad tidings of her Lord's tender care, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm. By the life of God! She hath attained unto that which the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise have attained, when her mention flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in this Ancient House. Were We to mention for My servants the fruits of My remembrance, they would sacrifice their souls in hope of a word from their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus hath My mercy preceded and My grace encompassed all, yet most of the people know it not.\n\nVerily We make mention of the remnant of My party and give him glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for him from God, the Lord of all worlds. We have remembered him and do remember him, and have ordained for him that which gladdeneth hearts and solaceth eyes. We have written for him the reward of martyrdom in My path, and I am the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And We counsel Our loved ones and friends to perform such deeds and show forth such character as befitteth their relationship to God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom. The splendor from Us be upon him and upon My party who have been martyred in My path and who have sacrificed their spirits for the glory of My straight path. O Ali, rejoice in the verses of God. He hath made mention of thee and of His servants who have turned toward His countenance with a steadfastness that neither guns nor armies could prevent. We have remembered them and revealed for them that which shall endure as long as My most beauteous names endure. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Supreme over what was and what shall be. O Khalil, the Wronged One maketh mention of thee and commandeth thee and those who have believed to observe the wisdom which We have sent down in the Scriptures and Tablets. Blessed is the servant who hath heard My call and turned to My horizon and arose to serve My Cause and performed that which was commanded in the Book. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty. By God! That which the peoples possess cannot equal it. To this testifieth He Who speaketh at all times that there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Bestower. And We make mention in this station of him who was named Ali, whom We mentioned before, and We give him the glad tidings of his Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all men. Blessed art thou, O Ali, and blessed are they who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords. The word of forgiveness hath at this moment been revealed for whomsoever desireth the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of all religions. The ocean of forgiveness hath surged as a token from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The splendor be upon thee and upon him and upon those who are with thee and have believed in God, the Lord of all beings. We have forgiven the one who hath ascended, then those who sought forgiveness from the ocean of their Lord's loving-kindness, the All-Merciful.

I bear witness that Thou hast, at all times, called out to all who are in the realm of creation, summoned them unto God, and guided them to His straight Path. Not for less than a moment did I pause, but rather did I speak forth in the Kingdom of utterance that which drew the hearts of them that know. Through thy scratching every soul that turned to God, the Lord of all worlds, was drawn nigh, and through thy movement were all created things stirred to motion in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Through thee were made manifest the hidden mysteries in the Books of God, and that which was treasured in His all-encompassing knowledge was unveiled.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of that which was visited upon My person by the hosts of the oppressors who turned away from Us and rose up against Us without any clear proof from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Say: O peoples of the earth! The promised Day is come, and He Who was promised calleth aloud with most exalted call. In every state doth He proclaim: \"There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Beware lest ye oppose Him through Whom every Book was sent down, every Messenger dispatched, and every wondrous Cause made manifest. Beware lest the cawing of the crows and the turning away of the opposers debar you from the Most Exalted Horizon and this clear and manifest Path.\n\nBy God's life! My Pen lamenteth and saith: \"O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and say not that which the idolaters said of old. Fear ye the Day whereon ye shall be questioned concerning your deeds in this vain life.\" He, verily, is the Commander, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Say: If ye oppose this Cause with any proof that would establish what ye possess, then bring it forth, and be not of them that tarry. This is the Cause of which the Bayan gave tidings, and before it Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before him the Spirit, and before him He Who conversed with God. The Point of the Bayan standeth before the Throne, giving utterance to this Name whereby the limbs of all names have quaked and the foundations of the idolaters who cast the Book of God behind their backs have been shaken, having followed every heedless and remote one.\n\nO Pen! Leave the mention of such people and turn thy face toward those who have turned unto God and believed in Him on a Day wherein the learned ones of the earth and their divines turned away, and those who followed them without My command before God - these are indeed among the abased ones. Make mention of the martyr who sacrificed his spirit with joy and fragrance in the path of My Name, the All-Merciful, with such steadfastness as amazed the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. Then make mention of him who was named Buzurg, who heard the scratching of My Pen and soared in My atmosphere and turned toward My face and spoke forth My beauteous praise. We have made mention of him in numerous Tablets and have revealed for him from My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book that which shall never cease to shed its fragrance as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. To this beareth witness He Who is established upon the throne of grandeur with mighty sovereignty.\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hear thou once again the call from the Lote Tree raised up above the luminous spot, as a bidding from God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O Buzurg! The Ancient Countenance hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and remembereth thee with that which hath caused the sweet savors of revelation to be diffused throughout the world. Blessed is he who hath found and recognized and hath said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Lords!\" My Most Great Branch hath presented before Me thy letter when the Wronged One was seated upon the throne of sorrow by reason of that which the hands of the deniers of God, the Lord of creation, have wrought. That which thou didst send through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, hath come before the Wronged One. We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that which shall rejoice thy heart and the hearts of them that have turned with spirit and fragrance toward My most exalted horizon. At this moment the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh, and My Branch writeth it as a token of grace from Me, and I am the Powerful, the All-Choosing. We make mention of thy sister, the consort of him who was martyred in My path, with a remembrance from My Most Exalted Pen before which all mention must bow down. O My leaf and My handmaiden! By God, all things have lamented for you, and the Most Exalted Pen, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise. Blessed art thou and blessed every handmaiden who hath loved thee and attained unto thy presence, and blessed thy mother whom We mentioned before, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We were with thee and with her and witnessed what befell you both, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge and with Him is the Mother Book. This is the Day wherein the banner \"He is God\" hath been raised aloft and the standard of divine power hath been hoisted upon the highest mountains. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call from the direction of the Throne, and blessed is he who hath beheld My Most Great Sign when it shone forth from the horizon of God's Will, the Revealer of verses. This is the Day wherein the ocean of My loving-kindness hath surged, and the sun of My grace hath shone forth, and the heaven of My mercy hath been upraised. Behold then, O ye who are endued with vision! O Buzurg! Say: O people of God! Beware lest the doubts of the divines or the allusions of them that have denied the Beginning and the Return withhold you. The Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery hath come, yet the people are in doubt and dissension.\n\nWe have desired at this moment to make mention of My leaf and My handmaiden whom We have caused to ascend unto the Most Exalted Companion, that it may be a treasure for her and a store with her Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. I bear witness that she turned unto God and hearkened and responded to her Lord whilst the people were in a strange sleep. By My life! The dwellers of the most exalted chambers in the highest Paradise and the celestial garden welcomed her - to this doth the Lord of Names bear witness at this moment, He Who proclaimeth that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Were her station to be revealed even less than the eye of a needle, all the tongues of the world would speak forth. Blessed is God Who hath preferred her and honored her and exalted her to such a degree that the leaves circle round her. The testimony of her Lord sufficeth her. By My life! Nothing that is seen or witnessed can equal it. Blessed are they who have recognized, and woe unto every obstinate denier!\n\nO Muhammad! The Wronged One makes mention of thee at a time when the wicked have encompassed Him from every direction. He speaks the truth before the faces of the world even as He spoke before, in such wise that neither the clamor of the peoples nor the might of the princes of the earth and their divines could deter Him. Thus have We made manifest the Cause with clear proof and evidence. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, inasmuch as thou hast attained unto My days, hast heard My call, and hast done that which was acceptable in the sight of the Wronged One. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty which hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's will, the Illuminator of all regions. Thou hast at this hour attained unto a grace from Us and a pardon from Our presence, and verily I am the All-Powerful, the Compeller. Blessed are ye for having shown patience in the path of God and borne that which none before you hath borne. To this beareth witness the Mother Book which is with Him. Thus have We purified you with the water of Our loving-kindness and made mention of you through My utterance whereby the horizons have been illumined. The glory shining from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of earth and heaven.\n\nWe make mention at this hour of My loved ones there who have testified to that whereunto God Himself hath testified: that there is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. O people of God! We counsel you to be trustworthy, religious, chaste and faithful, and to that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be, may be exalted. When ye have attained unto My verses and perceived the breezes of revelation, arise from your seats, turning toward the Wronged One, and say:\n\nO God of earth and heaven, Lord of the world to come and of this world! We testify to that whereunto Thy tongue hath testified in the Most Exalted Horizon, and we acknowledge that whereunto Thy Pen hath confessed. We beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the stars in the heaven of Thy wisdom to aid us to stand firm in Thy Cause and to strengthen us in that which beseemeth Thy days. O Lord! We are consumed by separation from Thee and our hearts are melted in our remoteness from Thee. We perceive the fragrance of Thy manifestation yet know not from what place the fragrance of Thy garment wafteth, nor where the rustling of the Tree of Thy Cause and the murmur of the waters of Thy loving-kindness are heard. We beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and by the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation to ordain for us, by the pen of Thy bounty, the reward of attaining Thy presence, of standing before Thy throne, and of appearing at the door of Thy majesty. Thou art He by Whose generosity all created things have testified and by Whose power all beings have borne witness. We implore Thee not to deny us that which is with Thee and that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have offered up their spirits in Thy path. By the Martyr whom the Concourse on High doth visit, we beseech Thee to ordain for us what Thou hast ordained for them. Then protect us from the evil of those who croak and who hinder people from the ocean of Thy utterance, the sweet waters of Thy bounty and the choice wine of Thy loving-kindness. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.

After its reading, We repaired to the Sacred Place where it was presented, and the tongue of favor spoke these words:\n\nO thou who gazeth upon the Countenance! The letters which thou didst send to the Branches and to the servant who is present were all laid before this Wronged One and their contents were made known. Praise be to the Lord of existence Who hath assisted and continueth to assist His loved ones in all matters, and Who hath opened wide the gates of nearness and reunion before their faces. This is among the great bounties of the Truth, exalted be His glory. In the days when the fire of the calumnies of the opposers and deniers was ablaze and the doors of joy, gladness, delight and expansion were shut, this Wronged One was and is occupied with the remembrance of His loved ones.\n\nO thou who art mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One! Know thou with clear certainty that varying winds have encompassed the Lamp of the world; nevertheless, It hath had and hath no purpose save reformation. It behooveth that honored one and the friends to occupy themselves with the remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, by night and by day, and to beseech Him to preserve the Lamp. However, in one station, the Kingdom of utterance speaketh these words: \"Thou seest, O my God, that the winds of hatred have encompassed Thy Lamp from all sides, and It declareth: 'O my God! I have surrendered my will to Thy will and my desire to the revelation of Thy desire. By Thy might! I desire not myself and my survival except to arise to serve Thy Cause, and I love not my being save for sacrifice in Thy path. O my Lord! Thou seest and knowest that they from whom we desired justice and fairness have arisen against us with tyranny and oppression. Outwardly they were with me, but inwardly they aided mine enemies who arose to violate my honor. My God, my God! I testify that Thou didst create the princes and ministers to champion Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word, yet they have aided Thine enemies. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause that hath encompassed existence and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the seen and the unseen, to adorn the people of the earth with the light of Thy justice and to illumine their hearts with the radiance of Thy knowledge. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I testify to Thy unity and Thy singleness, and to the sanctity of Thy Being and the detachment of Thine Essence. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy trusted ones in the hands of the treacherous among Thy creatures and the slanderers among Thy creation, and Thou knowest what hath befallen us from those of whom Thou art more aware than we are. They have committed that which hath rent asunder the veil of them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee to aid them to regain what hath escaped them in the days of the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thine inspiration. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\"\n\nO thou who gazeth upon the horizon of Revelation! Upon thee be My glory! We have beseeched and continue to beseech from God good, blessing, attention, detachment, confirmation and success for His loved ones. We hope that all may attain to that which is the cause of the glory of existence and the exaltation of the servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The loved ones of that land have ever been and are beneath the glances of favor. Convey to each one of them greetings from the Wronged One. We beseech God to adorn them all with the raiment of trustworthiness and righteousness and to illumine them. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most High.\n\nPraised be God! His grace hath at all times encompassed and continueth to encompass all things. We cherish the hope that through His bounty the gates of mercy may be opened from every direction, and all may be enabled to achieve that which will exalt His blessed Word.\n\nAs regards what was written concerning the son of that departed and exalted soul upon whom be the Glory of God and His mercy, it was presented and gained the honour of being heard. Thus hath the Kingdom of Utterance spoken. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\n\nO thou who gazest upon His countenance! The world hath been encompassed by successive and interlinked tribulations. I do not complain of My distress and sorrow to anyone. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before the faces of His loved ones the gates of His grace and mercy, and to confirm them in trustworthiness and religious devotion, and in that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nThey have surely heard of the affairs of the Afnan. Conditions have become so unstable that when some of the friends make drafts for the Huquq, the Afnan are unable to honour them. This matter hath caused visible impediments. In these days, a sum was owed on the house. Finally, matters reached such a state that We had to request funds from the Land of ?a. According to the letter of the Trustee written in the name of Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, he had collected from some and in every city he must deliver profits to their owners. Now affairs here are as described, therefore nothing can be drafted to the Afnan, nor can they be charged with matters requiring immediate payment. Thus is this Wronged One perplexed. Aqa 'Ali-Haydar and the Trustee have also been afflicted. The honored Afnan Haji Siyyid 'Ali has gone to 'Ishqabad where, as bidden, all properties have been put up for sale that perhaps \\[...\\]\n\nThis Wronged One beseecheth God to grant relief to all. He is the Bestower, the Almighty. The Afnan have not, until now, squandered anyone's property. They have many claims of various kinds, but their collection has been delayed. This Wronged One, and that soul, and all the loved ones should beseech from God whatsoever will cause the fragrance of trustworthiness and detachment to be diffused. God, exalted be His glory, hath said: \"Verily, with hardship goeth ease.\" It is hoped that affairs will be set right. With the generous, tasks are not difficult. That soul should not be sorrowful. The affairs of the world have ever alternated between hardship and ease, yet bounty is from God and generosity from Him. Assuredly these hardships will be followed by mercy, and this difficulty by ease. Soon will He fulfill His promise and manifest that which beseemeth His might, His majesty and His generosity.\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. God willing, may all be enabled to accomplish such deeds and actions as will cause their eternal remembrance. Verily, He loveth His servants, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nIn truth, matters have been greatly disturbed, and that which some have referred has remained delayed. However, now the honored Afnan gentlemen--His Honor Haji Siyyid Mirza, His Honor Haji Siyyid Muhammad, and His Honor Haji Siyyid 'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God--have firmly girded up their loins to settle the debts, and the imperative command has been issued from the Source of Authority that all properties should be sold and the debts paid. Indeed, all have adhered to this and there has been no laxity in carrying out the decree. They have announced that they will sell whatever they possess in 'Ishqabad, and seekers from every direction have come forward for the purchase of the properties. Now, according to the news received, they are occupied with this matter day and night. The Servant beseeches His Lord to assist them and to open before their faces the gates of His mercy and grace. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The loved ones of that land are, by God's grace and mercy, mentioned in the presence of their Lord, and the glances of His loving-kindness are directed towards them. It is certain that ere long that which shall cause the greatest joy will become manifest, for their intentions are all pure, and God, exalted be His glory, loves His servants, especially His trusted ones. If all attain unto this station, divine relief will assuredly come and encompass all. Verily, He has power over all things. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon God's loved ones there.\n\n=== END BH00685 ===\n\n=== START BH00686 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Learned, the Most Powerful, the Most Mighty!\n\nO thou who gazest toward the direction of God and art immersed in the ocean of His nearness and good-pleasure! Know thou that the Manifestation hath not emerged from the four elements, but rather is the Mystery of Oneness, the Pre-existent Essence, the Self-Subsisting Reality, and the Hidden Identity. Indeed, He cannot be known through aught else, nor can it be established for anyone that He hath appeared from the four elements, or from the basic substances mentioned in the language of the philosophers, or from the four natures - for all these were created by His command and will. He hath ever been, and there was naught else besides Him. Even now He exists in truth and is established upon the throne, revealing verses unto thee inasmuch as the fire of His love hath been kindled in thy heart. Is there any possessor of utterance in all existence who could speak with Him, or any revealer who could stand with Him in His Cause, or any being who could claim existence for himself? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! All are non-existent and void.\n\nWere He to be known through any other than Himself, His essence could not be proven free from similitude, nor His being sanctified from likeness, nor His uniqueness from the manifestations of creation. This is an ocean which none can enter, for all that thou beholdest in the heavens and on earth was created by His Word. By My very Self, the True One! Were He to make Himself known to His servants as He truly is, all would be severed from everything and would abide in His presence, to such extent that kings would glory in their servitude to their Master, and monarchs would cast their crowns behind them and hasten toward His direction and the paths of His good-pleasure. But since He is veiled from them, they have turned to other than Him and soar on the wings of self in the atmosphere of their conjectures and imaginings.\n\nTherefore bear thou witness with thine own essence, then with thy soul, then with thy tongue, that there is no God but Him. None can know Him save through Him, and none can draw near unto Him. He was not a manifestation in Himself, but rather a manifestation in His essence. This is what We have mentioned unto thee concerning the mystery of Divinity, the essence of Lordship, and the reality of Self-Subsistence.\n\nAs for the physical bodies, they are thrones for this Manifestation which none hath comprehended save Himself. Though these bodies have appeared in the world of creation in forms which ye behold, wert thou to regard them with the eye of reality and innate nature, thou wouldst witness that although they were created from the elements, they are sanctified therefrom such that no similarity exists between them. Observe the diamond - can stones compare with it? Thus hath it been revealed in the Bayan from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.\n\nWere it not for their temples, the temples of the servants would not have been created. If thou wert to look carefully, thou wouldst see that all in the heavens and earth were created from the outward appearance of their temples. All the worlds draw sustenance from the worlds of thy Lord through the appearance of the Manifestations of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. In each world He appeareth according to the capacity of that world. For example, in the world of spirits He shineth upon them and appeareth unto them through spiritual effects, and likewise in the worlds of bodies, the worlds of names and attributes, and worlds which none hath known save God. Each hath a portion from this Manifestation, appearing unto them in His image to guide them unto God their Lord, draw them nigh unto the seat of His command, and bring them to what hath been ordained for them. Even as His reality cannot be known, likewise nothing that is attributed to Him can be known except to a prescribed degree. Reflect upon thine own self - were it not for Him, the existence of \\[...\\]\n\nThe essence and pillars are such that the eye cannot see, nor can the ear hear, nor can the tongue speak, nor can the hand grasp, nor can the foot move. Yet He is the sovereign ruler over all, such that God has made all things dependent upon Him. Nevertheless, it is through the eye that He sees, through the ear that He hears, and through the tongue that He speaks. If you ponder upon this, you will find it to be among His greatness, such that His station is not diminished by these manifestations and descents. Consider then the jeweler who crafts a ring - though he is its maker, he adorns his finger with it. If the Most High appears in the garment of creation, this is of His grace, lest His servants flee from Him. Rather, they draw near to Him, sit before His face, hear His wondrous melodies, take delight in what proceeds from His mouth, and in what descends upon them from the heaven of His will. In this there is wisdom - were you to contemplate it throughout the duration ordained by God, you would discover at every moment what you had not found before. If the Most High were to appear in His true station and form and as He truly is, none would be able to draw near to Him or find intimacy with Him. For example, consider the throne or seat or chair and their like - these are crafted by one of His creatures through the confirmations that descend upon them from the heaven of His grace and the clouds of His bounty. He takes His seat upon them, though before His sitting none recognize them, seeing them merely as the work of their hands. But after He takes His seat upon them, all relations are severed from them - they become the Throne of the All-Merciful, around which circle the realities of all things created in the heavens and earth. Their recognition then depends upon the gaze of the observers and the insight of those endowed with luminous, radiant vision who bear witness that they were created before the creation of the heavens and earth, that they have ever been the Throne of the All-Merciful and will ever continue to be as they have been, having no relation, connection, direction or indication to anything else. All things testify with their inner tongue that these are the Thrones of the All-Merciful, having no likeness in creation and no peer in invention. From their elements appeared the elements, such that you see that from their fire appeared the fire in all realms of being, which spoke from the blessed Branch of Unity on the exalted Sinai to Moses the Interlocutor. From their water, every soul finds permanence and life. Likewise, consider what is beneath them and be assured with clear certainty. This is a description of the station of that upon which He sits - how much more exalted then is the station of His Temple and that which stands upon it! Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth that thou mayest ponder upon it and attain unto what thou desirest from God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. O Hadi! All that We have cast upon thee and mentioned in this Tablet is in the language of creation; otherwise, by Him Who holdeth all things in the grasp of His power, We have regarding that station such utterances as are not befitting to mention in these days wherein people have differed and cast the Lord of Lords behind their backs, fashioning with the hands of idle fancy an idol which they then worshipped and became of those who worship idols. Blessed art thou for what God hath desired for thee, and for having walked in the path of His good-pleasure until thou didst attain the presence of His shining and exalted countenance. His manifestation has ever \\[...\\]\n\nHe manifests Himself unto His creation through His creation, even as He revealed Himself unto thee with truth and delivered thee from the depths of the allusions of those who disbelieved in God and warred against His Self and took unto themselves lords other than God at all times, and were among the people of tyranny and error in a glorious and perspicuous Book. And wert thou to be immersed in the ocean of might and power, thou wouldst surely know that He is able to make any one of His creatures the creator of whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. All power lieth therein, if thou be of them that ponder, and all grace lieth therein, if thou be of them that witness. Ask thou God, thy Lord, that He may manifest His Cause throughout all lands and raise the servants to such a station wherein shall be mentioned unto them what He desireth, without veil or hindrance, and teach them from the wonders of His knowledge, and nourish them with the fruits of the Tree of His grace and bounty, that all may be enriched through His riches and empowered through His transcendent and glorious might. By Him Who moveth all things by His command! Were I to find the people as We created them, I would surely open a gate from the gates of mercy and inner meanings, that all might witness all mysteries with their own eyes and subdue all lands through the names of their Lord. But thou seest the creation and hearest what proceedeth from their mouths; therefore grace hath been restricted save to the measure whose dewdrops ye find, and thy Lord is, verily, witness and well-informed of this. And were We to manifest Our Self more than what We have manifested it, the dogs and swine would surely encompass Us. Thus crowed the Cock of the Throne and warbled the Dove, out of love for thee, that thou mayest be of the thankful. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00686 ===\n\n=== START BH00687 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Great.\n\nIndeed the hearts of the sincere are consumed in the fire of separation: Where is the gleaming of the light of Thy Countenance, O Beloved of the worlds?\n\nThose who are near unto Thee have been abandoned in the darkness of desolation: Where is the shining of the morn of Thy reunion, O Desire of the worlds?\n\nThe bodies of Thy chosen ones lie quivering on distant sands: Where is the ocean of Thy presence, O Enchanter of the worlds?\n\nLonging hands are uplifted to the heaven of Thy grace and generosity: Where are the rains of Thy bestowal, O Answerer of the worlds?\n\nThe infidels have arisen in tyranny on every hand: Where is the compelling power of Thine ordaining pen, O Conqueror of the worlds?\n\nThe barking of dogs is loud on every side: Where is the lion of the forest of Thy might, O Chastiser of the worlds?\n\nColdness hath gripped all mankind: Where is the warmth of Thy love, O Fire of the worlds?\n\nCalamity hath reached its height: Where are the signs of Thy succor, O Salvation of the worlds?\n\nDarkness hath enveloped most of the peoples: Where is the brightness of Thy splendor, O Radiance of the worlds?\n\nThe necks of men are stretched out in malice: Where are the swords of Thy vengeance, O Destroyer of the worlds?\n\nAbasement hath reached its lowest depth: Where are the emblems of Thy glory, O Glory of the worlds?\n\nSorrows have afflicted the Revealer of Thy Name, the All-Merciful: Where is the joy of the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, O Delight of the worlds?\n\nAnguish hath befallen all the peoples of the earth: Where are the ensigns of Thy gladness, O Joy of the worlds?\n\nThou seest the Dawning Place of Thy signs veiled by evil suggestions: Where are the fingers of Thy might, O Power of the worlds?\n\nSore thirst hath overcome all men: Where is the river of Thy bounty, O Mercy of the worlds?\n\nGreed hath made captive all mankind: Where are the embodiments of detachment, O Lord of the worlds?\n\nThou seest this Wronged One lonely in exile: Where are the hosts of the heaven of Thy Command, O Sovereign of the worlds?\n\nI have been forsaken in a foreign land: Where are the emblems of Thy faithfulness, O Trust of the worlds?\n\nThe agonies of death have laid hold on all men: Where is the surging of Thine ocean of eternal life, O Life of the worlds?\n\nThe whisperings of Satan have been breathed to every creature: Where is the meteor of Thy fire, O Light of the worlds?\n\nThe drunkenness of passion hath perverted most of mankind: Where are the daysprings of purity, O Desire of the worlds?\n\nThou seest this Wronged One veiled in tyranny among the Syrians: Where is the radiance of Thy dawning light, O Light of the worlds?\n\nThou seest Me forbidden to speak forth: Then from where will spring Thy melodies, O Nightingale of the worlds?\n\nMost of the people are enwrapped in fancy and idle imaginings: Where are the exponents of Thy certitude, O Assurance of the worlds?\n\nBaha drowning in a sea of tribulation: Where is the Ark of Thy salvation, O Savior of the worlds?\n\nThou seest the Dayspring of Thine utterance in the darkness of creation: Where is the sun of the heaven of Thy grace, O Lightgiver of the worlds?\n\nThe lamps of truth and purity, of loyalty and honor, have been put out: Where are the signs of Thine avenging wrath, O Mover of the worlds?\n\nCanst Thou see any who have championed Thy Self, or who ponder on what hath befallen Him in the pathway of Thy love?

The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined, and the Mount hath called out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds!\"\n\nO peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the call of Him Who is the Fashioner of the heavens, Who hath come with the Kingdom of Names. He speaketh at the heart of the world and summoneth all unto His Most Great Name, through which all things proclaimed when it was made manifest: \"The Promised One hath come with His All-Compelling Name and hath spoken: 'There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.'\" Every ear hath been blessed by the melodies of Revelation, yet the heedless are in manifest error.\n\nO concourse of men!

Make mention of him who is named Hassan, that he may rejoice in Thy remembrance and speak forth with wisdom and utterance among the concourse of creation concerning \\[this Cause\\] which, when sent down from the heaven of Revelation, the books of the past submitted unto it. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Arise to praise and glorify with such steadfastness as the hosts of the earth, who follow vain imaginings and idle fancies, cannot hinder thee. Say: This is the Day of Utterance, did ye but know, and this is the Day of praise and glorification, could ye but understand. The appointed time hath come and the Promised One hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. He calleth unto the peoples from within the Most Great Prison and summoneth them unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus hath the tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in the kingdom of utterance that thou mayest hear and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of the Promised Day.

Hold thou fast unto the Sure Handle, then aid thy Lord through deeds and virtuous character. Thus was it revealed aforetime and at this hour. By the life of God! The treasures of the world cannot compare with a single word from thy Lord. To this testifieth the Lord of Eternity, Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison: \"There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Informed.\" Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the All-Merciful and hath taken from the hand of His bounty the Kawthar and Salsabil. How many a learned one hath lamented My separation, yet when the ocean of My presence surged, turned away and was numbered among the idolaters. How many a mystic hath spoken My Name and yearned for My days, yet when the horizon of Revelation was illumined, pronounced judgment against Me without clear proof or perspicuous Book. How many a prince hath sought My house and circled round it in My name, yet when I manifested Myself, desired to shed My blood, following those who turned away from the Truth and advanced toward every remote scholar. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken that thou mayest hear and be among the thankful. And We make mention of thy brother who is named Hussein that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Remembering, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of 'Ali, that the rapture of his Lord's verses may draw him to the station whereon is established the throne of My Most Great Name. O 'Ali! By My life, wert thou to taste the sweetness of My utterance, thou wouldst soar upon the wings of longing in the atmosphere of My Will and speak forth My praise amidst My servants with the wisdom We have enjoined upon all in My perspicuous Book. Beware lest the intimations of the ignorant grieve thee - they by whom every Prophet hath mourned and every faithful Messenger hath cried out. They made mention of Me by night and day, yet when I manifested unto them My Beauty, they turned away and perpetrated such wrong as caused the Concourse on High to lament, and those who bear the Throne of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Say: O concourse of the earth! Take hold of the Book with the power of God and follow not your idle fancies. Fear God and be not of them that turn aside. This is the Day of Recognition, unto which the Concourse on High hath turned, and a company of the near-stationed angels. This is the Day whereon the Spirit proclaimeth before the Face: By God! He Who was hidden within the veils of the Unseen hath appeared. Hasten, O peoples of the earth, and be not of the wrongdoers.\n\nO My loved ones in the West! Rejoice at My turning toward you, My drawing nigh unto you, and My remembrance of you. Beware lest the veils of the powerful withhold you. Be as mountains in the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Ye have heard the taunts of the enemies in My path; now hearken unto that wherewith the Tongue of Grandeur praiseth you in this station which God hath sanctified above all names. Blessed are ye and your fathers and your mothers, and those who love you and make mention of you and walk in My straight Path. The ocean of forgiveness hath surged in the name of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Give thanks unto Him for this great bounty. He hath indeed forgiven you and your fathers and mothers, and hath absolved you and them of evil deeds. He is verily the All-Merciful, the Gracious. My favor is complete, My proof perfected, the cock of My Throne hath crowed, and My testimony hath appeared, yet most of the people are deniers. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those women who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.\n\nO handmaidens of God in that place! We make mention of you as a bounty from Our presence and a mercy from Our court, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Merciful. Rejoice in My mercy and My loving-kindness and My generosity and My grace and My bounty which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\n=== END BH00688 ===\n\n=== START BH00690 ===\n\nHe is God! Quintessential gems of divine unity and delicate pearls of holy praise ascend unto the court of the peerless Sovereign and glorious King, Who hath caused the realities of all created things and the subtleties and refinements of the essences of beings to emerge from utter nothingness into the realms of existence and immortality, and Who hath rescued them from the abasement of remoteness and extinction, exalting them to the kingdom of glory and eternity. This was naught but His Own prior grace and all-embracing mercy, for it is evident that absolute nothingness hath no capacity or receptivity for existence, and utter extinction hath no worthiness for being and creation.\n\nAfter creating all contingent beings and bringing all things into existence, through the revelation of His Name \"the Choose\", He selected man from among all peoples and creatures for His own knowledge and love, which was the ultimate purpose and cause of the creation of all beings, as mentioned in the well-known sacred tradition. He honored and distinguished man with the robe of honor - \"We have created man in the best of forms\" - and with the mantle of grace and favor - \"Blessed be God, the most excellent of creators\" - for while He revealed Himself to the essence and reality of each thing through one of His names and shone forth through one of His attributes, to man alone did He make the manifestation of all names and attributes and the mirror of His own Essence, distinguishing him with this supreme bounty and ancient mercy.\n\nHowever, these effulgences of the light of guidance and these outpourings of the sun of grace lie hidden and concealed within human reality, even as the flame, rays, and light are hidden within the reality of the candle and lamp, and as the radiance and brilliance of the world-illumining sun remains concealed in mirrors and reflecting surfaces that have been darkened by the rust and dust of human limitations. Now this candle and lamp needs one to light it, and these mirrors and surfaces require one to polish them. It is evident that unless a fire is kindled, the lamp will never be lit, and unless the mirror is cleansed of rust and dust, the image, likeness, revelation and effulgence of the eternal sun will never be reflected therein.\n\nAnd since there hath never been and can never be any connection, relationship, harmony or resemblance between the created and the Creator, between the temporal and the eternal, between the contingent and the Absolute, therefore in every age and dispensation He manifesteth a pure essence in the realm of earth and heaven, and createth this divine subtlety and heavenly mystery from two elements: the outward physical element and the hidden divine element. And He createth in him two stations: one the station of reality, which is the station wherein he speaketh only by God his Lord, concerning which it is said in the tradition, \"I have states with God wherein I am He and He is I, except that I am I and He is He,\" and likewise, \"Stand still, O Muhammad, for Thou art the Beloved and Thou art the Love,\" and also, \"There is no difference between Thee and them, save that they are Thy servants\"; and the other the station of the human, concerning which He saith, \"I am but a man like unto you,\" and \"Say: Glory be to my Lord! Am I aught but a mortal messenger?\" These pure essences and luminous realities are the universal intermediaries of divine grace, and are sent forth with supreme guidance and \\[...\\]\n\nThat these pure and yearning hearts and these sanctified realities might, through divine inspiration, heavenly grace, and holy breezes, be rendered pure and luminous, cleansed from the turbidity of earthly realms; that the hearts of those drawn nigh might be purified from the rust of limitations; so that the divine trust, which lies hidden and concealed within realities, might emerge from behind the veil of secrecy like the radiant sun dawning from the divine daybreak, raising the banner of manifestation upon the hills of hearts and minds.\n\nFrom these words and allusions it has become clear and established that there must needs appear in the realm of earth and heaven a Reality and Essence Who would be the channel of universal grace and the Manifestation of the Name of Divinity and Lordship, that all people might be educated under the shadow of that Sun of Reality, and thereby attain to this station and rank that is deposited within their realities.\n\nThis is why in all ages and times Prophets and holy ones have appeared among men with divine power and eternal might. No sound mind would ever be content to consider this door of guidance closed merely because it fails to comprehend certain words, nor would it imagine a beginning or end for these Suns and Lights. For there is no grace greater than this universal grace, nor any mercy greater than this all-encompassing divine mercy. There is no doubt that were His grace and favor to be withheld from the world for a single moment, it would surely cease to exist.\n\nTherefore, the doors of God's mercy have ever been open to the face of creation, and the rain of His grace and bounty will forever pour forth from the clouds of Truth upon the lands of capacity, realities, and entities. This is God's way from all eternity to all eternity.\n\nHowever, after the appearance of these holy Countenances in the world of manifestation and witness, some souls and people become afflicted with the darkness of ignorance - the fruit of their own deeds - while others become occupied with passing vanities. And since that hidden Beauty calls all people to complete detachment and sacrifice, they therefore turn away and stretch forth their hands in harm and injury.\n\nAnd since these Monarchs of existence, in the world of the spirits, accepted with utmost desire and yearning all tribulations in God's path, they therefore deliver themselves into the hands of their enemies, such that whatever harm and injury they can inflict upon the bodies, limbs and members of these sanctified Essences in the realm of earth and witness, they carry out. And since the believers and loved ones are like the branches and leaves of this blessed Tree, whatever befalls the root of the Tree must surely befall its branches, twigs and leaves.\n\nThis is why in all ages such tribulations and afflictions have been and will be the portion of the lovers of the All-Glorious Beauty. There has never been a time when these Manifestations of Divine Unity appeared in the earthly realm without such tribulations, afflictions and ordeals. Though outwardly imprisoned and \\[...\\]\n\nThough they have become the victims and outcasts of the land, yet inwardly they are the recipients of God's hidden favors. And though they are deprived of physical comfort and bodily pleasures, yet they partake of spiritual comfort and the delights of the fruits of inner meaning and the holy celestial yields. Were people to observe with the eye of insight, it would become evident that these trials and tribulations, these hardships and calamities, which have descended upon the sincere ones and the believers, are the essence of comfort and the reality of bounty, while this comfort and glory of those who have turned away from the truth is itself affliction, torment and hardship. For the consequence and fruit of these tribulations is the supreme comfort and the cause of attaining the highest horizon, while the recompense and effect of this comfort is great hardship and affliction, and the cause of descent to the nethermost depths. Therefore, at no time should one be saddened by the descent of trials and tribulations, nor should one be sorrowful and grief-stricken by the manifestation of ordained events and calamities. Rather, one must hold fast to the firm handle of patience and cleave to the strong cord of forbearance, for the Lord hath ordained a measure and reckoning for the reward of every good deed except patience, concerning which He saith: \"Verily, the patient will be paid their recompense without measure.\"\n\nI remember and long for Aqa Mirza Ismail with the utmost yearning and attachment. God willing, may you ever abide secure and at rest beneath the shadow of God's grace.\n\n=== END BH00690 ===\n\n=== START BH00691 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance!\n\nUpon thee be Glory, O Samandar! Ism-i-Jud, upon him be Glory, forwarded your letters to the Most Holy Court in the days when we were at the Most Great Scene at the Mansion of Bahji. All were honored to be beheld and favored to be heard. Blessed are they who are engaged with spirit and fragrance in the remembrance of the Best Beloved of the worlds and are steadfast in service. The Supreme Pen hath from the earliest days until now borne witness to thy acceptance, thy devotion, thy steadfastness and thy service. We praise God, blessed and exalted be He, for having aided thee to hold fast unto His cord in His days and to cling to His robe. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful.\n\nMention hath been made of Andalib, upon him be Glory. We have verily aided him and will continue to aid him. Thy Lord is indeed the Helper, the All-Wise. We send him greetings from this Station and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded existence both seen and unseen.\n\nThe servant present before Us submitted the pages of proofs, and they were graciously accepted. Verily he hath spoken the truth regarding this Great Announcement and this firm, sound, and mighty Cause.\n\nConcerning what thou didst mention about the compilation of verses and epistles - this deed is regarded and recorded as among the most great works in the sight of the Self-Sufficient. In these days the revealed Tablets are being read in Our presence, for many Tablets written both before and after were dispatched to various regions without being compared. Therefore, in these days they are repeatedly being read in Our presence, that what God hath intended and what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken may become manifest. Many verses and evidences have fallen into the hands of the idolaters, both in the Land of Ta \\[Tehran\\] and other lands. The people of God must make a mighty effort to preserve and protect the Tablets. In the Land of Ta, whatever was found in certain homes was seized and fell into the hands of the heedless. We have commanded all to preserve what hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to aid them to do what He loveth and pleaseth and to draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nLetter of Khalil, upon him be Baha, was presented before the Most Holy Court and was honored with attention and favor. We beseech God to assist him and those with him to exalt His Word and to make his mention penetrating in the hearts and effective in the souls. On the last night of Jamadi'l-Avval, this servant presented his letter. Blessed be he! O Samandar! You mentioned Nabil-i-Akbar who has turned to various regions specifically for the service of the Cause and exaltation of the Word. Ask God that fruit may appear and it may not be without effect. We have revealed from the Kingdom of Our utterance in the Tablet of Wisdom, addressing him: \"Be thou as the throbbing artery in the body of creation, so that through the heat generated by this motion the souls of the hesitant may be quickened.\" Blessed is he who hath attained to the outpourings of this Ocean in the days of his Lord, the Most Generous, the All-Wise. Be thou a promoter of the Cause of God with an utterance which will set ablaze the trees and cause them to speak: \"Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\" Say: Utterance is a substance that seeketh penetration and moderation. As for penetration, it dependeth upon pure and unencumbered hearts, and as for moderation, it must be combined with wisdom which We have revealed in the Books and Tablets. And in another connection: \"Walk with the power of the Most Great Name above the world that thou mayest witness the mysteries of eternity and discover that which no one hath discovered. Verily thy Lord is the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Were all the powers of the seen and unseen to be concentrated in the power of hearing, then perchance it could be said that it would be capable of hearkening unto this Call which is raised from the right hand of the Throne; and were the strength and brilliance of all eyes to be concentrated in one eye, then perhaps it would be worthy to behold these signs. With utmost humility and supplication beseech ye the Self-Sufficient One that He may not deprive His servants and that He may bestow upon them the Kawthar of immortality from the chalice of His bounty. We beseech God to assist His servants and confirm them in that which beseemeth His days. Verily, He is the Bountiful, the Generous. O Samandar! The hosts of victory are goodly deeds and praiseworthy attributes. In the divine Tablets this word hath repeatedly been revealed: We have enjoined upon all the fear of God and that whereby stations and ranks are elevated. Blessed are they that act. One word setteth ablaze, and another extinguisheth. Today the ocean of grace is surging and the sun of bounty is shining. Whosoever speaketh for the sake of God, its effects shall be manifest in all regions. Through the movement of the Supreme Pen We have set the world aflame and raised the banner of \"He is God\" upon the highest station of the world without concealment or hindrance. From the beginning of the Cause until now We have stood before the hosts and spoken. The oppression of the world did not prevent Us and the clamor of nations did not hold Us back. We beseech God to confirm all to teach His Cause with joy and fragrance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Javad, upon him be My Baha. He and his kin have ever been and continue to be remembered. Blessed is he, for he hath been faithful to God's Covenant and Testament, and hath arisen to serve Him and His loved ones over successive years. We have revealed for him that which hath brought solace to the eyes of them that are nigh unto God. Convey My greetings to Jinab-i-Muhammad-Karim. He hath attained unto My mention and My favor, and is under the glances of My grace, the Mighty, the Great. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to him and remind him of that which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of all worlds. Mention was made of Jinab-i-Yahya, upon him be the Glory of God, in the Most Holy Court. The answers to his questions were sent in both the revealed and written scripts. God willing, may they discover the fragrance of God from His words, and drink and give to drink from His ocean of meanings. Ye made mention of Jinab-i-Amin and Fay?u'llah, upon them both be My Baha. Each hath attained unto the mention of the Wronged One. We make mention of Fay? and give him glad tidings of the favors of his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. As for Amin, upon him be My Baha and My favor, he hath repeatedly mentioned that land and the hardships and hospitality shown, and previously mention of these matters was revealed from the Supreme Pen and sent forth. All the women of that land are adorned with the ornament of mention. We beseech God to adorn them with the garments of virtuous deeds and to ordain for them the good of both this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of the Throne and earth. We make mention of the teacher who turned towards God when the servants turned away, and who acknowledged when the people of the land denied. We verily send Our greetings unto him from this manifest station. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Ye made mention of Jinab-i-Amin's journey on foot from the land of Rasht to the land of Qaf. O Samandar! We bear witness that he was mounted upon the finest steed in all the world and was seated in the most exalted carriage of all nations, for this walking on foot is a testament to humility, submissiveness, resignation, contentment and detachment. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing Expositor, the All-Wise Rememberer. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to all the kinsmen and give them glad tidings of God's favor. All are mentioned before the Wronged One and have attained unto the traces of the Supreme Pen. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon My loved ones there who were not kept back from God, the Creator of heaven and Lord of the Throne and earth, by the might of the enemies. O Samandar! At the end of the book We make mention of the kinsmen and of Jud, upon him be My Baha, and convey greetings and give glad tidings of the favor of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to aid them, to grant them success, and to ordain for them the good of both worlds and that which shall be a treasure with Him. He verily is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. He ordaineth for His loved ones that which shall benefit them in all the worlds of His worlds. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Choosing. The prayer shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance and the glory gleaming from the direction of My prison be upon My loved ones who have arisen in their days to serve My Cause and have done that whereby My Word was exalted. These are they upon whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise send their prayers, and they who circle round the Throne in My mighty prison and in the Land of Mystery and in Zawra, the place from whose horizon hath shone forth the Day-Star of My Revelation, the Mighty, the Wondrous. And praise be to God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.\n\n=== END BH00691 ===\n\n=== START BH00692 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Glory!\n\nImmeasurable praise befitteth the threshold of the Peerless One Who, through the effulgence of the Sun of inner meanings, hath adorned human hearts with the ornament of divine knowledge and embellished the temples of human existence with the robe of His recognition, rendering them distinguished thereby. The tongues of the world are powerless to mention the wonders of His bestowals, and the pens of all nations fall short in recording the subtleties of His favors. His grace hath encompassed all horizons, and His bounty hath pervaded all existence. Should one gaze with the eye of insight upon the wondrous ordering of creation, he would be astonished and bewildered by the subtle favors of the Desired One towards him. In the divine tradition He saith: \"O son of man! I created all things for thy sake, and thee for My own sake. Flee not from Me.\" Alas and regret that they are deprived of that for which they were created, occupied with their own idle fancies, and prevented from receiving the lights of the Sun of Truth. In this spiritual springtime, when all the world is verdant and flourishing from the divine breezes of knowledge, the trees of human existence have not stirred nor become verdant. Glory be to God! The heedless ones have not discovered that which is the good of existence and the tranquility of humanity in both the seen and unseen realms. All these trials and hardships are for the sake of guiding people to eternal good and perpetual ease, and for the elevation of the servants to spiritual realms and their attainment to the luminous heights of holiness. Yet the possessors of selfish desires have prevented the people from entering the precinct of acceptance and arriving at the city of attainment. We beseech God--exalted be His glory and magnificent His favors--to rend asunder, through His complete power, the veils that hinder, and to guide all to the direction of guidance and the dawning-place of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nO thou who art turned towards the realm of immortality, who drinketh from the pure waters of the Salsabil of reunion, and who hath laid hold of the hem of faithfulness! Thy first and second letters arrived in succession and brought the utmost joy and delight. However, at that time, due to the frequency of occupations, the sending of a reply was delayed. In these days, while intending to write, thy third letter arrived and added joy upon joy. After reading thy letters, thou wert present before the Face and mention was made of thee. The Tongue of the Divine Will, addressing thee, spoke these exalted words, His word, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn My Name, which controlleth the Tablet and the Pen \\[...\\]\n\nO Leaf! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of all names, and the loving-kindness of God, the Creator of heaven, and upon the 'Ayn and the Ba who have attained unto the love of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, who have arisen to serve the Cause and performed that which brought joy to all hearts and souls. The river of names hath deprived people of the ocean of inner meanings. At times the word 'successor' became a veil, at other times the word 'mirror', and yet at other times words such as 'chief', 'noble', 'learned' and the like. Although through the power of the Supreme Pen some veils were rent asunder, others remain, for people are heedless and veiled. Until now they have not found true unity and have not comprehended the station of the Day of God. They cling to vain imaginings, return to vain imaginings, and are oriented towards vain imaginings. Praise and gratitude be to Him that thou hast attained and beheld the Most Exalted Horizon, and been honored to hear that for which ears were created. Strive that perchance thou mayest, with joy and fragrance, illumine the people of the world with the effulgent rays of the Sun of true unity. Say: O people of God! Wisdom is a mighty shield; hold fast unto it and be occupied with rendering assistance to the Cause. By the life of the All-Merciful! Victory is through wisdom and utterance, and naught else is acceptable in the sight of God, for the people of God are for the betterment of the world. They must arise to that which will conduce to the exaltation and advancement of governments and peoples. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. Certain Tablets have been revealed from the Supreme Pen in answer to some, and have not yet been sent. We beseech God to confirm them in the Greater Steadfastness, lest doubts and allusions prevent them from the Source of verses and the Revealer of clear proofs. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon My loved ones there.\n\nWe hope that you may ever be blessed with the favors of the All-Knowing King and be confirmed and assisted in teaching the Cause of the All-Merciful with wisdom and utterance. In truth, if in this glorious Day one renders a service and becomes the cause of guidance and enlightenment of one of his fellow beings, the mention thereof shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Say \\[...\\]\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord of the world and Sovereign through Thy Most Great Name! I beseech Thee by the dominion of Thy power and the kingship of Thy might to make me steadfast in Thy service and to aid me at all times to guide Thy creatures to the source of Thy knowledge and the wellspring of Thy wisdom. O my God, my Lord and my Hope! Thou knowest that I desire naught but Thy mention and praise, and to arise in service to Thy Cause in Thy lands. I beseech Thee to withhold not from me Thy outpourings in Thy days, and to assist me in what I have purposed in Thy path. Grant me, through Thy all-encompassing grace upon all who dwell on earth and in heaven, the Kawthar of bounty and the Salsabil of immortality. O Lord! Thou seest the servants heedless of Thy manifestations in Thy days and veiled from the effulgence of the lights of Thy oneness and the dawning of the Sun of Thy singleness. Strengthen those whom Thou hast caused to recognize Thy Self, whom Thou hast honored with Thy knowledge, and whom Thou hast adorned with Thy acceptance, to do what befitteth Thy days of manifestation: to detach themselves from all else and to confine themselves to that which endureth through the permanence of Thy sovereignty and dominion - namely, to guide creation to the paradise of Thy knowledge. Look not upon the heedlessness of the servants and the veiling of the lands, O Sovereign of the Beginning and the End, but rather upon Thy grace, Thy mercy, Thy generosity and Thy loving-kindness. Look not upon the weakness and impotence of creation, but rather upon the might of Thy power and the dominion of Thy strength. Preserve, O God, Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies who have remained heedless of Thy Cause and have committed what they were forbidden in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Lord of abundant grace. There is none other God but Thee, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord of Names and Sovereign of earth and heaven! With what tongue can I thank Thee for the wonders of Thy bestowals, and with what utterance can I praise Thee for the manifestations of Thy grace and bounty? Thy mercy hath encompassed us from all directions, and Thy grace hath preceded us, O Lord of earth and heavens! How can nothingness describe the attributes of the Sovereign of eternity? By Thy glory! I am bewildered in Thy remembrance and astounded by the predominance of Thy kindness and the succession of Thy generosity and favor. Were I to praise Thee throughout the duration of the kingdom and dominion, I would not be able to comprehend the least of Thy favors, nor could I describe the smallest of Thy bestowals - how much less Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and the attributes of Thy power, might, majesty, glory and dominion! I beseech Thee to accept from me what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book, and to look not upon my poverty, want, abasement and lowliness, but rather upon Thy glory and power. Aid me to such remembrance as shall endure in Thy kingdom and shall be a cause for my attaining, at all times, unto the heights of Thy nearness. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Gracious, the Munificent, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nConvey to the honored ?abib Ru?ani 'Ayn-Qaf-Ba sublime and wondrous remembrances and glorifications. Likewise to M.H., may the glory of God rest upon them both. We beseech God to strengthen them and grant them the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. To the honored Aqa Mirza Mahmud, may the glory of God rest upon him, I send most wondrous and sublime glorifications, and I beseech and hope for God's grace and favor on his behalf. In the first letter, mention was made of the honored Aqa Jalil - glorify him on my behalf and remember him with beautiful remembrance. I beseech God to strengthen him, preserve him and grant him what is best for him. Verily, He is the Kind, the Generous. Remember all the friends with gracious remembrances and most sublime glorifications. Glory and praise be upon you and upon them all. As pressing tasks were successive, this was sent in the handwriting of one of the friends.\n\n\\[Muhammad 'Ali\\] 202\n\n=== END BH00692 ===\n\n=== START BH00693 ===\n\nO thou lion-hearted soul, Even as a lion roar, That thy roaring may perchance To the seventh heaven soar!\n\nPraise be to Him Whose Essence is immeasurably exalted above the strivings of human hearts, however pure, to soar into the atmosphere of His nearness, and Whose Being is immensely sanctified beyond the exertions of human minds, however lofty, to ascend unto the heaven of His presence. From time immemorial He hath been exalted above the description of aught save Himself, and He will forever continue to be sanctified beyond the praise of all created things. The hearts of them that have recognized Him are sore perplexed before the tokens of His everlasting handiwork, and the minds of them that have attained His court are bewildered by the wondrous evidences of the Revealers of His oneness. He, verily, is the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO friend! Thine epistle was received. It told of naught save the fire which hath been kindled in the tree of human reality, and bore no message but that which bestoweth a new life upon enlightened hearts. Well is it with him that hath been set ablaze by the fire of thy love, and who hath quaffed the water of life from the cup of thine affection. \"The righteous shall drink of a cup tempered at the camphor fountain.\"\n\nTo continue: Thy letter, which was a repository of the pearls of celestial knowledge, was brought before this Exile. God be praised, it rolled up the scrolls of separation and remoteness and spread out in their stead the realms of nearness and reunion. Methinks through the water of thy longing the fire of separation was changed into \"coolness and safety\". In truth, a perfect meeting was attained through thy letter, and, through thy mention of the stations of Divine Unity and the signs of pure abstraction and oneness, it lifted from the world the veils of limitation. And this, notwithstanding that even the limitations of the world of existence are praised and cherished by the wayfarer, for he seeth all things in the mirror of the verse \"No defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of mercy\", and at every moment he heareth with his inner ear the tongue of the Holy Spirit uttering the words \"Seest thou a single flaw?\" In faithlessness he beholdeth the secret of fidelity, and in deadly poison he tasteth the sweetest honey. Even vengeance is embraced in this state; nay more, the true lover welcometh the betrayal of the beloved. Thy faithlessness I cherish more Than every gift that life can give. To suffer at thy vengeful hand-- How much dearer than to live!\n\nThus do the wayfarers in the wilderness of solitude and search experience events and conditions which, though to outward seeming be a mortal poison, are inwardly a wholesome draught, and though in appearance a passing mirage, are in reality pure and refreshing waters. Were I to attempt a full description of this station, neither could I express it nor the hearer grasp it. And whoso observeth with the eye of innate knowledge will confess, openly as well as privily, the selfsame truth.\n\nAs to perceived differences, these can be attributed to the divers stations that have been attained by them that tread the path of search and mystic knowledge. Thus, at one time the wayfarer beholdeth the lover hastening in search of the beloved through the wilderness of desolation, and at another he seeth the beloved yearning for the lover across the wilds of longing and devotion, or wandering, aimless and bewildered, the wastes of love in his pursuit. \"O for a drop to drink!\" the thirsty soul doth groan; \"O for a thirsty soul!\" the spring in turn doth moan.\n\nFrom yet another vantage he perceiveth that the lover and the beloved are one and the same, and that the seeker is himself the very object of his search. \"How can the lover from the loved one ever part?\" So it is that, at times, the lovers of the celestial Beauty sound the clarion of \"Say: All things are of God\", while, at others, they raise the call of \"It is from thyself.\"\n\nSome have related the aforementioned stages to the inner and outer journeys of the soul, which is the station of \"the knowledge of certitude\", whilst others that have quaffed the wine of reunion regard each and every stage as relating to that knowledge, and consider the two stations of \"the eye of certitude\" and \"the truth of certitude\" as being exalted above and sanctified beyond these realms and all that pertaineth unto them, even as hath been clearly affirmed by that mystic knower. For in all these stages the mirror of the wayfarer's heart may bear the reflection of shadowy desires, wayward thoughts, and worldly attachments. Wherefore hath it been said that, in these stations, at one time the hosts of reason are triumphant and, at another, the armies of love prevail. At one time, the clouds of affliction and sorrow conceal the heavens of gladness and joy; at another, the eternal leviathan of love devoureth, in one fleeting moment, all manifestations of sadness, anguish, grief, and dejection, and the morn of divine guidance dawneth forth with the joyful tidings of \"despair not of God's mercy\", and the gentle breezes of His providence dispel every vestige of torpor and estrangement. These tidings, however, are not constant and immutable in these stations, and the wayfarer remaineth confined between the right hand of faith and assurance and the left hand of denial and despair.\n\nSome wayfarers remain forever veiled in these stages. Others are assisted by invisible aid from the Source of unfailing grace, whereat the hosts of the Realm on high raise the tabernacle of divine power, and the ascendency of \"and verily Our host shall conquer\" is manifested, obliterating the signs and standards of every worldly attachment and limitation, even as alluded to by some who have attained this station. At such times, the ascendancy of God's names and attributes will so surround a soul as to leave it no place either to stay or to flee. This station, however, hath its own obscurities and impediments, for they that journey towards the land of Divine Unity and detachment are still wrapt within the confines of names and attributes, and take delight in their gardens and bowers. Thus it is that, in describing these stations, some have made reference to the \"unity of existence\" and the \"unity of appearance\". By this is meant that the seeker will close his eyes to all save his Beloved and open them to naught but His beauty. He will pass beyond the mortal world and approach the everlasting realm. He will see no beauty but the Beloved's and hear no utterance but His praise; that is, he will avert his gaze from aught save His beauty and refuse to hearken to any melody but the sweet accents of His voice. Howbeit some are led astray even in this station; for no sooner do they inhale the fragrance of reunion, and hearken unto the voice of the doves of heavenly grace, than they imagine themselves to have attained perfection and wander lost in the wilderness of self-conceit, thus depriving themselves of the soft-flowing stream of divine providence and the ethereal cup of heavenly delight.\n\nYet others, assisted by the grace of the everlasting Friend, consume these veils with the fire of His love and step into the meads of ancient glory. That is, forsaking the wilderness of the \"unity of existence\", they attain unto the ultimate abode of the \"true appearance of the Divine Unity\". So clearly will they witness in this stage God's all-encompassing mercy that in every created thing, both in the world and in the souls of men, they will behold Him Who hath been interpreted as the Holy Outpouring. No longer will they close their eyes to any beauty, nor stop their ears from hearkening to any voice. For there is no prohibition in this stage and no debarment, inasmuch as in all things they will discern, with both their outer and inner eyes, the revelation of the signs of Him Who is the King of all names and attributes, and in every atom they will find a door that leadeth to the garden of Divine Unity and the city of pure abstraction. \"Where'er I turn my gaze, 'tis Thee Whom I behold.\" So entirely will the hearts of the wayfarers be transported by longing for the ecstasies of this station that they will come to conceive no stage apart from this stage, to see themselves as abiding within the court of the Beloved and circling round His sanctuary, and to consider it as the ultimate abode of them that search and the uttermost station of such as have attained.\n\nA myriad names and attributes have been ascribed to these degrees and stations, which I am disinclined to mention here. It is, indeed, solely because of thy longing and devotion that I have engaged in such ephemeral and limited topics. And this, notwithstanding that speech is the greatest evidence of the worth of the speaker and guideth unto the recognition of the source of guidance, for no more complete and enduring proof hath been or will be vouchsafed unto man from the empyrean of everlasting glory than words and utterance. This, verily, is a self-evident truth, for the braying of the donkey can never compare with the cooing of the dove. Never wilt thou hear from the raven the melodies of the nightingale, nor inhale from the abject beetle the fragrance of eternity.\n\n=== END BH00693 ===\n\n=== START BH00694 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to God, the Ever-Abiding, the Eternal, the One, the Self-Subsisting, the Single, the All-Subduing, the Most Exalted, Who was and shall be even as He hath ever been. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Praise be to God Who gladdened His servant with the rising of the sixth star from the horizon of the heaven of your bounty, and this came to pass after the sealing of the fifth book which testified to your station, and after witnessing and recognition, it ascended and was presented before the face of the Beloved. When mention was made of the son of Ismu'llah-i-Asdaq - upon them both be the Glory of God - and Jinab-i-Mirza Asadu'llah - upon him be the Glory of God - thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which diffused the fragrance of utterance throughout all possibility. He spoke, and His sweetest words are these:\n\nO Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! Numerous letters from Ibn-i-Asdaq - upon him be My Glory - and from Jinab-i-Asad - upon him be My bounty - which they had sent to this Servant have arrived and all were mentioned in the presence. Praise be to God, they are blessed with divine bounty and are occupied in serving the Cause. That which consoleth the eyes and causeth souls to soar hath been revealed for them both. Give them the glad-tidings of My mention, My bounty and My mercy which have preceded all creation. God willing, may they be engaged in promoting the divine Cause with the utmost joy and fragrance, wisdom and utterance. In these days their reply is being revealed and shall be sent. O Zayn! The physical body is observed to be ailing from what hath befallen it, and this is why at times there is delay in answering petitions. We have accepted all tribulations. Whatever hath come from without hath been witnessed, and assuredly its effects shall appear in the body as well.\n\nAs to what thou didst write concerning one of the handmaidens of God and Aqa Muhammad Husayn, the shoemaker from N and J, and likewise Husayn and Ibrahim from that land - the details of each were presented in the Most Holy Court. He said: O Zayn! Give them the glad-tidings of My mercy, My forgiveness, My grace and My bounty. We have forgiven them as a token of Our favor. God willing, may they attain unto steadfastness in the Cause, for the satans shall be spread abroad and the books of hell shall appear. Blessed are they for having attained unto the mention of the Wronged One Who hath been imprisoned without proof or written testimony. Convey greetings from the True One to all the people of that land and say: God willing, all must remain firm and steadfast in God's Cause through the divine Name and the power and might of the Lord, in such wise that neither the knowledge of the learned, nor the understanding of the mystics, nor the clamor of the ignorant, nor their composed books shall prevent those souls from the Owner and Source. The glory and splendor from Us be upon them and upon those who have attained unto this most exalted, most holy, mighty and most sublime station.\n\nWe make mention of Husayn and Ibrahim and give them the glad-tidings of the acceptance of what they intended in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have mentioned them with a mention that shall endure as long as the kingdom endureth. Thus hath the Pen spoken that every soul which hath acted according to what it heard from the command of its Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, may rejoice thereby. God willing, may all be adorned with the ornament of the most great steadfastness and be detached and free from all else but God.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Shahverdi, upon him be the Glory of God, he had some funds with Haji Ali, and when the aforementioned Haji intended to go to Hauran, he submitted that he had these funds which should be used to obtain a book. Then, according to instructions, since Mulla Muhammad-Ali Dahaji was about to depart and had no travel expenses, they directed that Haji Ali give it to him, and one book was taken in exchange for those funds from Ism-i-Jud (the Name of Bounty), upon him be \\[the Glory of God\\], and it is ready. Whenever a trustworthy person is found it will be sent. Inform him of this. And they said that Shahverdi has truly attained two blessings - he both became the owner of a book and his funds were spent in the path of God. Blessed is he, for he is among those who have attained the presence at a mighty station.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, that he had sought permission - this was submitted at the Most Holy Court. They said: \"Praise be to God, through the wonders of divine bounty he has entered the ocean of attainment and drunk from the cup of meeting. Now let him be occupied with service to the Cause. It would be most loved in the sight of God if, having returned from the Land of Kha, he would proceed to the regions of the Land of Ta, that perchance he might guide the veiled souls and draw them to the highest horizon.\" The Glory be upon him. End.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote mentioning the blessed verse \"This is the Day of the Call, yet ye are silent,\" and that after reading it they arose to serve - excellent is what was mentioned and excellent is what was done. This blessed Tablet was revealed but was not outwardly sent in any direction, yet it appears the angels of diffusion have taken it everywhere and spread it abroad. Would that the people of Bayan would reflect on this single Tablet and observe with fairness. They have taken the calf and cast aside God, the Lord of all worlds. This servant was greatly delighted by this blessed verse which Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah wrote about. Truly the throat of the world is inadequate and falls short for this Call. This servant will mention this entire blessed Tablet that the fragrance of the All-Merciful may waft throughout creation and every fair-minded one may take a path to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. His word - exalted be His mention, exalted be His utterance, glorified be His praise, and magnified be His grandeur:\n\nHe is the Most Great \\[...\\]\n\nThe Promise hath come and He Who was promised hath appeared, yet the people are in manifest confusion. The Ocean of Life hath surged, yet they hasten unto death. The fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, yet they turn away therefrom. They have taken the stagnant pool and cast aside the sweet-flowing stream. What aileth them that they perceive not? They occupy themselves with dust, turning away from the Bestower of Gifts. Verily they comprehend not. By God! Their eyes are blind and their ears are deaf - they neither hear nor see.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned to the Light and set his face toward God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling - he who heard the Call when it was raised in the kingdom of creation and hastened through the fields of divine good-pleasure until he recognized and declared: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and unseen!\"\n\nSay: O people of Baha! Are ye asleep, or hath the wine of vain desire overtaken you and prevented you from remembering God, the Lord of existence? Say: This is the Day of Rising - how is it that ye remain seated? This is the Day of the Call - how is it that ye remain silent? Arise in My Name, then speak with wisdom and utterance, that perchance the people of possibility may turn unto the All-Merciful, Who calleth from this forbidden station.\n\nSay: Have ye heard, yet remained patient? Fear God, and be not of them that know not. Say: Turn ye, that ye may hear God's melody in the Kingdom of utterance. By My life! Were they to hear it, the rapture of longing would so seize them that they would dance and be unaware thereof. Say: Do ye forsake the cup of immortality and take the fetid water of mortality from the hand of every rejected transgressor? Say: Hath the teacher of passion taught you this, or your own selves? Be truthful with Me, O people, and follow not every veiled liar. Arise with wisdom and remind the servants of that which the Lord of creation hath commanded you, that perchance they may turn unto God, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nThus hath My Pen spoken, My Tongue uttered, and My limbs testified. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and taken the Tablet of God with the hand of power and drunk therefrom that which was inscribed in My Preserved Tablet. O thou who drinkest from My cup and speaketh in My Name! Give thanks for this sealed Book which hath been sent down to thee from the heaven of grace.\n\nPraise be to God that the sixth star hath been adorned with the Divine Light of utterance and hath been sealed with the blessed Tablet. Therefore it behooveth thee, me, and all who have turned to God to say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and the earth!\"\n\n\\[In the margin of the above text it is written: To Jenab-i-Zayn, written in response when his sixth letter arrived at the time of sealing the envelope, on the 16th of Dhi'l-Hijjih\\]\n\n=== END BH00694 ===\n\n=== START BH00695 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath kindled the lamp of utterance and sustaineth it with the oil of knowledge and wisdom in the midmost heart of creation. He it is Who, by His command, hath caused the trees of existence to yield the fruits of knowledge in the invisible realm and the visible world, and through His Word hath illumined the daysprings of hearts with the lights of the knowledge of His cherished and glorious countenance. He it is Who hath adorned the body of the world with the ornament of His Most Great Name and hath summoned all peoples to the quarter of His most perfect mystery and hath unveiled to the mystics who have attained His presence the mysteries of eternity. None can resist His bidding or prevent His judgment. He revealeth whatsoever He willeth in creation and draweth aside the veil of concealment from His hidden beauty, though the unbelievers be averse.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of existence and Ruler of the seen and unseen! How can I thank Thee for the wonders of Thy favors, and with what tongue can I praise and glorify Thee for that which Thou hast bestowed upon Thy servants in the days of the manifestation of Thy beauty and the dawning of the sun of Thy majesty? By Thy glory, O Lord of mankind and Manifestation of the mysteries of divine decree! I see my tongue powerless to render thanks for even the least of Thy favors, how much less to offer praise and gratitude before the revelation of Thy grandeur and greatness. Were Thou to transform all my limbs into tongues with which to thank Thee, it would still be trifling compared to the manifestations of Thy grace and the evidences of Thy loving-kindness. Through the sovereignty of Thy mercy, Thou didst create us and provide for us and cause us to appear in these days which Thou didst promise to Thy chosen ones in Thy Scriptures and Tablets. This is a blessing that cannot be compared with aught else in Thy earth and heaven, and this is a gift for which the hearts of the Prophets and Saints yearned, and in remembrance and desire of which the hearts of the chosen ones and faithful ones were consumed. How many nights did they weep with longing to attain Thy days, and how many days did they shed tears in their quest to exist in the world at the time of the manifestation of Thy beauty! Thou, through Thy most great favor and most perfect bounty, hast ordained for us this supreme blessing and this greatest gift. We beseech Thee to assist us, through the sovereignty of Thy power, to recognize its value and render thanks for it. Accept, O our God and our Lord and our Hope, our mention and our praise and our glorification. Look not upon our weakness and poverty, but rather upon Thy power and Thy riches and Thy majesty and Thy independence. Aid us to remain steadfast in the path of Thy love and to stand firm in the way of Thy good-pleasure. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, possessed of infinite grace. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nO thou who art enkindled with the fire of longing and who holdest fast to the hem of the Covenant on the Day of Meeting! That which thou didst inscribe with the trace of ink hath been received. From its darkness wafted the musk-scented breeze of love and fellowship, and from its whiteness shone forth the lights of harmony and unity. I read it and pondered it, and comprehended its allusions and all that its words encompassed. I beseech God, the Lord of Eternity, by His Most Great Name, to ordain for thee every good beneath His shadow, to protect thee from the evil of the wicked among His creatures, and to adorn thee at every moment with the ornament of His grace. Verily, He is the Kind, the All-Loving.\n\nGrieve not that there hath been delay in writing. By thy life! The heart is occupied with thy remembrance and the remembrance of the chosen ones of thy Lord. What is inscribed upon stones may be effaced, but that which is inscribed upon the tablet of the heart from the verses of love shall never be erased. Blessed art thou, and glad tidings be unto thee, for the favors of thy Lord have encompassed thee. He hath assisted thee in His service, adorned thee with the ornament of His grace and mercy, and caused thee to dwell beneath the shade of His Divine Lote-Tree. We thank Him for this manifest grace, and praise Him at all times, before all times, and after all times.\n\nIn Persian it is mentioned: Praise be to God! Thou art adorned with the ornament of grace and dwellest beneath the shade of bounty. In most times, mention of thee floweth from the Tongue of Divine Will, and the bestowal of supreme favor in thy behalf is evident. After the arrival of thy letter, one day it was presented before the Presence, and mention was made of thee. The Tongue of Grace spoke these exalted words - His words, exalted be His utterance and magnified be His favor: He is the Witnessing, the All-Hearing \\[...\\]\n\nO son of Attar! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, and upon thy mother and father and thy two brothers. Verily they have attained to the Meeting and have quaffed the choice wine of reunion from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to the Desired One of all worlds that thou art mentioned from the Most Exalted Pen as \"O son of Attar.\" In truth, thou art the perfumer from whom the fragrance of Divine love wafteth, and the Concourse on High doth inhale it. Every soul who is today adorned with the ornament of the love of God - his fragrance is diffused, his light is radiant, his name is resplendent, and his mention is effective. The glances of loving-kindness have ever been directed towards you. Protect the Cause of God and hold fast unto wisdom. He will teach you that which will profit you through His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous One. Convey My greetings to the men and women of that household and gladden them with God's loving-kindness. Let not the world's differences and changes grieve you. By the life of God! That which hath been ordained for you is such that all the treasures of the earth cannot equal it. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve this most exalted station. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The effulgent, manifest, and evident Light be upon the people of God and upon you and upon those whom neither the might of the world nor the clamor of nations hath frightened, who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: verily, there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAsk ye God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive mankind of this supreme blessing and most great gift. The veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings have so encompassed the people of the world that they have entirely blocked the path of salvation and the way of life, save for the hidden favors and inner confirmations of the Lord of all beings to take them by the hand and lead them from the wilderness of perdition to the highway of salvation. Those who have abandoned the Bayan and are heedless of the Cause of the All-Merciful, who count themselves among the people of the Bayan, have once again clung to previous idle fancies and barred themselves from nearness to the Divine Law. For centuries upon centuries the Divine Manifestations have guided the servants to the path of righteousness and warned them against the abyss of vain imaginings and approaching the precipice of idle fancies. Repeatedly in every age and cycle, They have clearly explained whatsoever prevented previous peoples from accepting the truth. Yet again the heedless servants are seen clinging to the same issues, far removed from the path of knowledge, distant and separated from their true homeland.\n\nSay: O my God, my Lord, and my Hope! I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of Thy power and the dominion of Thy might to protect Thy people from the whisperings of the devils and the promptings of the corrupters, and to guard the pearls of their love for Thee from the hands of the thieves. Verily, Thou art the Sovereign of all worlds and the Lord of the heavens and the earths.\n\nO thou beloved! I was engaged in writing the reply when a letter arrived from one of the friends containing that which grieved the hearts of the people of understanding, for it brought news of the ascension of the Leaf who had adorned herself in the days of her Lord with the ornament of her Master's loving-kindness, who had spent her time in service to the friends, and who was called from the Tongue of Grandeur the Mother of the near ones. She followed the example of the Blessed Leaf who sprang from the Tree in ascending from the cage of mortality to the gardens of holiness, nearness and eternity. Upon her be the glory of her Lord, the Creator of all things and the King of earth and heaven. What hath befallen you hath grieved the hearts of them that circle round. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to console you and comfort you and to send down upon you patience and tranquility from His presence. Grieve not in the days of thy Lord but hold fast to the cord of patience and resignation. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nThe first praise that appeared in the world of creation and the first mention that moved the tongues of the near ones be upon thee, O thou leaf that art firm and stirring upon the Lote Tree, ascending to the heaven of grace and mercy, and rising to the kingdom of power and grandeur! Blessed art thou for having been adorned with the ornament of eternity and for having cast off from thyself the garment of mortality. Joy be unto thee in this great bounty and mighty gift! I beseech God, exalted be He, to confirm His handmaidens in what He hath confirmed thee in His days, and not to deprive them of that which thou hast attained in His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth and worthy to answer. Convey My greetings to thy two brothers and mention them with wondrous mention. Glory and praise be upon thee and upon them and upon your family and upon the steadfast loved ones of God. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00695 ===\n\n=== START BH00696 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Move across the Tablet by My command and authority, and behold all created things as mere bodies moved by the winds, bereft of spirit, save those who have detached themselves from all things, drawn nigh unto God, and whom God hath purified from the defilement of all who dwell on earth. Stand firm in My steadfastness, then summon the servants unto My Cause. Say: O people! Fear God and dispute not concerning Him but for Whom the Spirit would not have been made manifest, nor would the Sun of Batha have shone forth, nor would He Who was named 'Ali have come in the Kingdom of Names. Thus hath the matter been decreed, yet the people are in evident heedlessness. Say: Fear God, O people, and oppose not Him but for Whom the Fire would not have been kindled in the Tree of Sinai upon the blessed spot of the Mount for Moses, the Interlocutor, nor would the Fire have been made a light for Our Friend, nor would God's Cause have been established amongst His creation, nor would the Sun of Eternity have shone from the horizon of holiness in the name of your Lord, the Most High.\n\nFear God, O concourse of earth and heaven, then be ashamed before Him Whose blood was shed for love of this Beauty Who hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of holiness with a message of supreme magnitude. Say: O people! This is the Youth for love of Whom the blood of the Prophets and Messengers was shed, did ye but know. Whosoever opposeth these verses while claiming to believe in what was revealed in the Bayan shall be cursed by all who dwell in the heavens and earth, and by those who recline upon exalted thrones of glory in the Most Sublime Paradise. Say: This is He Who took the covenant of His own Self with 'Ali aforetime in all the Tablets. Behold Him, O people of the Bayan, that ye may take Him as your path to God in this Manifestation. Beware lest ye regard Me with any eyes but Mine own; behold Me as God hath commanded you, and be not of those who follow their desires and cast the All-Merciful behind their backs, choosing instead the path of Satan.\n\nSay: Can one who standeth between earth and heaven be compared with one who remaineth concealed behind veils? Nay, by the Self of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Bountiful, if ye but knew. Say: Can one through whom the realities of all things were set ablaze, and in all things was kindled the fire of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Choosing, be compared with one who is consumed by the fire of self and passion, and is far removed from the shores of nearness? Can one who walketh in the atmosphere of the spirit be likened unto one who sitteth at home? Judge fairly then, O people of the Bayan, and be not oppressors and ungrateful.\n\nSay: This is He Who aided His Lord in the days when the hearts of those near unto God were sorely shaken, when the feet of the seekers slipped, when the countenance of every sincere soul was turned back, and Who arose to uphold God's Cause by His own self, voicing His praise among His servants until He was imprisoned in this Prison, and God is witness unto this. By God! The Pen of the All-Merciful moveth only to make mention of Me and to praise Me, and His tongue speaketh naught but to describe My glory and beauty. Indeed, He came only to announce unto you My presence and prepare you for My days. Yet when the promise was fulfilled and the Youth came in the shadows of the clouds, ye denied Him until ye pronounced against Him a clear injustice.\n\nVerily, purify thine ear from what thou hast heard that thou mayest hearken unto the melodies of God which shall draw thee to a wondrous station of glory. Then convey unto the servants this Cause whereby every steadfast soul hath been shaken and \\[...\\]\n\nAll are struck with fear except those who come before God with radiant countenance. Say: O people, be ye ashamed before God Who created you for My manifestation. Commit not that which would dishonor the Cause, and associate not partners with God after He hath called you to the Most Glorious Paradise and asketh from you neither recompense nor thanks. If ye are able, go forth from your homes in support of His Cause; otherwise, remain where ye are but commit not that which ye were forbidden in the Book of Ali, then in Muhammad's Qur'an, and then in the holy and impregnable Tablets. Know thou that victory hath been ordained in the Remembrance and the Bayan - thus was it revealed at the beginning of this Manifestation, if thou be well-informed thereof. We forbade the servants from warfare and contention, yet some committed that which We prohibited and transgressed the bounds set by God. But God hath pardoned whom He willeth, for He is powerful over all things. O people! Transgress not what hath been revealed in the Book. Be God-fearing in the Cause. Cast not the ordinances of God behind your backs. Act according to that which ye have been commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. They who have shed their blood in the path of God - their spirits have ascended to the heaven of mighty glory and are established in the Most Glorious Paradise, near the mercy of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High. God shineth upon them at all times with a wondrous radiance, and they drink from the Kawthar of beauty from the hands of the grace of your Lord, the All-Merciful, while youths circle round them at every dawn and dusk. Would that we were with them and ascend to the Supreme Companion! This is what I desire for Myself and for those who follow Me, and this indeed is a mighty bounty. Say: O people! Turn not unto the world and its ornaments. By God! It shall perish, and ye shall return to an abode wherein ye shall find no companion for yourselves. Hearken unto My words and deprive not yourselves of meeting your Lord, and be not among the rebellious in the land.\n\nO Pen of Command! Make mention of him who was named Ahmad and was martyred in the path of God in days when all were veiled from Him. Though he committed that which was forbidden, yet God pardoned him through His grace, for verily He encompasseth all things. His spirit ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion, and the hosts of the invisible realm of glory received him, and the lights of his Lord's countenance enveloped him from every direction until he entered the Most Glorious Paradise with a radiant visage. Were We to detail the station of those who have been martyred, the people would assuredly become detached from their own souls and ascend unto a sublime and holy kingdom. Convey Our glorification unto the faces of those whom God hath related unto Him, for verily they possess a magnificent station with God. Say: Beware lest ye grieve for him, for he dwelleth now in wondrous joy. Then make mention in the Book of him who was martyred with him, for whom an abundant recompense hath been ordained. He is now with him in the highest paradise, enjoying blessings that are sanctified above all comparison. And thou, O Muhammad, hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the direction of the Throne once again, that the verses of thy Lord may cause thee to ascend unto the Divine Lote-Tree, the sublime and glorious seat. Grieve not over anything. Make mention of thy Lord amongst His servants, for verily thy Lord is with thee and watchful over thee. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the presence of God and stood before His countenance, and for having been illumined by the Sun of Beauty from the horizon of thy Lord's brow with manifest splendor. Hold fast unto the cord of God, then detach thyself from all else, that thy words may influence the hearts of those who doubt this Cause. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded by One Who is Mighty, All-Knowing. Wouldst thou remain in thy house while the Youth is in the hands of the oppressors from among the people of the Bayan, and there hath befallen Him that which all created things are powerless to recount? O Muhammad! Fear no one. Arise to praise thy Lord among His creation, for this is better for thee than all that hath been created between earth and heaven. Thus hath the command been sent down upon the Tablet from One Who is Powerful, Mighty. Then remind from Us those servants who have believed in God and have detached themselves from every remote idolater. Say: O servants of the All-Merciful! Aid your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in this Revelation which hath appeared in His Most Glorious Name, and turn not your attention to whatsoever hath been created between earth and heaven. This is better for you, did ye but know. He desireth naught for you save to draw you nigh unto a sublime station of glory. Remember Him in private and in public, and let not the censure of those who have denied God openly and who are wretched upon the earth cause you to fear. Purify your hearts for His recognition and your ears for hearkening unto His melodies. This is My counsel unto you and unto every discerning and insightful one. The Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who have remained steadfast in the Cause.\n\n=== END BH00696 ===\n\n=== START BH00697 ===\n\nIn the name of Him Who is the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be!\n\nPraise sanctified above the recognition of all contingent beings befitteth the Lord of the invisible and the visible, Who by His Most Exalted Word distinguished the people of Baha from all else. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an regarding the Day of Resurrection in His exalted words: \"One party shall be in Paradise, and one party in the Fire.\" This is that Day unto which the countenance of the divine Books was turned, and wherein the mysteries of the heavenly Scriptures were made manifest and clear. He is the Almighty One Whom neither the tyranny of the oppressors nor the calumnies of the slanderers could deter from His purpose. Exalted, exalted be this Day wherein the treacherous one was brought low and the trustworthy was elevated. Command and judgment belong unto God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nSay: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having manifested that which was hidden in hearts and concealed in breasts. I testify that Thou hast revealed Thy Cause before all faces and called everyone unto Thy manifest and visible horizon. Among the people are those whom the hand of Thy power hath delivered from the pit of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and among them are those who violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, taking vain imaginings as their lord instead of Thee and a god other than Thee. I beseech Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of power and in Whose right hand are the reins of all choice, by the waves of the seas of Thy grandeur and bounty, and by the light of Thy Cause whereby the cities of Thy knowledge and wisdom were illumined, to send down upon Thy loved ones from the clouds of Thy grace the rains of Thy blessings and wealth. Then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies who denied Thy truth, disputed Thy signs, cast behind their backs Thy laws, and denied Thy proof. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I heard Thy call and hastened to the horizon of Thy manifestation, and attained unto that which was recorded in Thy Books. I beseech Thee, O God of the Kingdom and the Dominion, and Lord of might and power, by Thy Name through which Thou didst deliver Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones from the oppression of the Pharaohs of the earth and its tyrants, not to disappoint me from that which Thou hast ordained for those of Thy servants who are detached and those of Thy creatures who are sincere, whose heads Thou hast adorned with the crowns of detachment and whose temples Thou hast adorned with the ornament of righteousness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Loving, the All-Forgiving.\n\nO Kazim! Upon thee be the light shining from the horizon of Revelation. The letters thou didst send in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, attained Our presence and were heard. Praise be to God, from them wafted the fragrances of the garden of inner meanings, utterance, wisdom and mystical knowledge. Today, whosoever hath turned unto Him and hath drunk the choice sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of the Desired One is, in the estimation of God, possessed of all stations. He is the learned one in God's sight, even though he be unable to read a single word. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto this most exalted station and supreme summit.\n\nO Kazim! Praise the Desired One of the world Who granted you steadfastness. How many souls have turned towards Him and then, for the slightest reason, turned away from the True Cause! Blessed is the servant who fixeth his gaze upon the blessed words \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth.\" Such a one is among the companions of the Crimson Ark. No command deterreth him, nor doth anything cause him to slip. He holdeth fast unto the cord of God in such wise that the peoples of the world are powerless to separate him from it.\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones. Say: O people of God! Today the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary is raised from the highest paradise. Have ears worthy of hearing been created and raised up? Say: Yea, verily!

They have, in the name of the Peerless Friend, set out for the place of sacrifice and have scattered the pearls of the spirit, which are the most precious gems in the world, at the feet of their Beloved.\n\nSay: My God, my God! Aid Thy servants to draw nigh unto Thee, that they may hearken unto Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. Then enable them to read Thy verses and to turn unto the light of Thy countenance. O Lord! Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy knowledge, nor the learned ones from that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will. I testify that Thy mercy hath encompassed all created things and Thy grace hath preceded all existence. Make known unto Thy servants Thy straight path and Thy tidings at which the limbs of the idolaters have quaked. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nO my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call which was raised from Thy most exalted horizon, and for having made me recognize the ocean of Thy verses and the sun of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity and the rain-clouds of Thy grace to assist me to remain steadfast in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nO Kazim! Make mention of the kinsmen of the exalted martyr on behalf of the Wronged One. Perchance the fragrance of God's remembrance may seize them and enable them to attain unto the greatest steadfastness. Give them glad-tidings from Me and remind them of My verses and illumine them with the light that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of grace - a bounty from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nToday the blessed, all-embracing Word hath encompassed all things and the Sun of Revelation hath shone forth and become manifest from the horizon of the heaven of power. The loved ones of God must, through kindly counsels and praiseworthy character, purify and sanctify the people of the earth from bestial qualities and guide them to the horizon of justice. Perchance the fire of sedition and corruption may be quenched by the living waters of love and the world may be illumined with a fresh radiance. During nights and days We have enjoined what is right and forbidden what is wrong, yet some have attained to that which they are commanded while others are still observed to be heedless. We beseech God to assist all to do that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth and He is the Hearing, the Answering One.\n\nAt the end of this epistle We make mention of him who is named Ahmad, who attained Our presence and heard Our call. We testify that he is among those who have attained in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Ahmad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the One, the Single. We have counseled the people of God to be sincere and pure, to show forth love and devotion, to be trustworthy and faithful. When the sun of trials dawned from the horizon of the heaven of the Will of the Desired One of all worlds, some hearts were troubled, some feet faltered, while a group, by God's might and power, remained firm and steadfast. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto the traces of God. He is indeed among those who are drawn nigh.\n\nThe names thou didst send have each been remembered. Verily He remembereth His loved ones at eventide and at dawn, and He is the One manifest on the Day of Meeting. He commandeth all to observe the Covenant and Testament. O Kazim! Convey glory and praise to God's loved ones from the Wronged One. Blessed is the ear that hath heard the praise of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, and blessed is the eye that hath beheld His sacred court, sanctified from the mention of all that was and shall be.\n\n=== END BH00697 ===\n\n=== START BH00698 ===\n\nIn the name of the one true God\n\nPraise be to the all-perceiving, the ever-abiding Lord Who, from a dewdrop out of the ocean of His grace, hath reared the firmament of existence, adorned it with the stars of knowledge, and admitted man into the lofty court of insight and understanding. This dewdrop, which is the Primal Word of God, is at times called the Water of Life, inasmuch as it quickeneth with the waters of knowledge them that have perished in the wilderness of ignorance. Again it is called the Primal Light, a light born of the Sun of divine knowledge, through whose effulgence the first stirrings of existence were made plain and manifest. Such manifestations are the expressions of the grace of Him Who is the Peerless, the All-Wise. He it is who knoweth and bestoweth all. He it is who transcendeth all that hath been said or heard. His knowledge will remain forever above the grasp of human vision and understanding and beyond the reach of human words and deeds. To the truth of this utterance existence itself and all that hath appeared therefrom bear eloquent testimony.\n\nIt is clear and evident, therefore, that the first bestowal of God is the Word, and its discoverer and recipient is the power of understanding. This Word is the foremost instructor in the school of existence and the revealer of Him Who is the Almighty. All that is seen is visible only through the light of its wisdom. All that is manifest is but a token of its knowledge. All names are but its name, and the beginning and end of all matters must needs depend upon it.\n\nThy letter hath reached this captive of the world in His prison. It brought joy, strengthened the ties of friendship, and renewed the memory of bygone days. Praise be to the Lord of creation Who granted us the favour of meeting in the Arabian land, wherein we visited and held converse. It is Our hope that our encounter may never be forgotten nor effaced from the heart by the passage of time, but rather that, out of the seeds thus sown, the sweet herbs of friendship may spring forth and remain forever fresh and verdant for all to behold.\n\nAs to thy question concerning the heavenly Scriptures: The All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.\n\nWe can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great, with incalculable afflictions. We see it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned. They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have interposed themselves between it and the Divine and infallible Physician. Witness how they have entangled all men, themselves included, in the mesh of their devices. They can neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have they any knowledge of the remedy. They have conceived the straight to be crooked, and have imagined their friend an enemy.\n\nIncline your ears to the sweet melody of this Prisoner. Arise, and lift up your voices, that haply they that are fast asleep may be awakened. Say: O ye who are as dead! The Hand of Divine bounty proffereth unto you the Water of Life. Hasten and drink your fill. Whoso hath been reborn in this Day, shall never die; whoso remaineth dead, shall never live.\n\nThou hast written concerning languages. Both Arabic and Persian are laudable. That which is desired of a language is that it convey the intent of the speaker, and either language can serve this purpose. And since in this Day the Orb of divine knowledge hath risen in the firmament of Persia, that tongue deserveth every praise.\n\nO friend! When the Primal Word appeared amongst men in these latter days, a number of heavenly souls recognized the voice of the Beloved and bore allegiance unto it, whilst others, finding the deeds of some to be at variance with their words, remained far removed from the spreading rays of the Sun of divine knowledge.\n\nSay: O children of dust! He Who is the Spirit of Purity saith: In this glorious Day whatsoever can purge you from defilement and ensure your peace and tranquillity, that indeed is the Straight Path, the Path that leadeth unto Me. To be purged from defilement is to be cleansed of that which is injurious to man and detracteth from his high station--among which is to take undue pleasure in one's own words and deeds, notwithstanding their unworthiness. True peace and tranquillity will only be realized when every soul will have become the well-wisher of all mankind. He Who is the All-Knowing beareth Me witness: were the peoples of the world to grasp the true significance of the words of God, they would never be deprived of their portion of the ocean of His bounty. In the firmament of truth there hath never been, nor will there ever be, a brighter star than this.\n\nThe first utterance of Him Who is the All-Wise is this: O children of dust! Turn your faces from the darkness of estrangement to the effulgent light of the daystar of unity. This is that which above all else will benefit the peoples of the earth. O friend! Upon the tree of utterance there hath never been, nor shall there ever be, a fairer leaf, and beneath the ocean of knowledge no pearl more wondrous can ever be found.\n\nO children of understanding! If the eyelid, however delicate, can deprive man's outer eye from beholding the world and all that is therein, consider then what would be wrought if the veil of covetousness were to descend upon his inner eye. Say: O people! The darkness of greed and envy becloudeth the radiance of the soul even as the clouds obstruct the light of the sun. Should anyone hearken unto this utterance with a discerning ear, he will unfurl the wings of detachment and soar effortlessly in the atmosphere of true understanding.\n\nAt a time when darkness had encompassed the world, the ocean of divine favour surged and His Light was made manifest, that the doings of men might be laid bare. This, verily, is that Light which hath been foretold in the heavenly scriptures. Should the Almighty so please, the hearts of all men will be purged and purified through His goodly utterance, and the light of unity will shed its radiance upon every soul and revive the whole earth.\n\nO people! Words must be supported by deeds, for deeds are the true test of words. Without the former, the latter can never quench the thirst of the yearning soul, nor unlock the portals of vision before the eyes of the blind. The Lord of celestial wisdom saith: A harsh word is even as a sword thrust; a gentle word as milk. The latter leadeth the children of men unto knowledge and conferreth upon them true distinction.\n\nThe Tongue of Wisdom proclaimeth: He that hath Me not is bereft of all things. Turn ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else but Me. I am the Sun of Wisdom and the Ocean of Knowledge. I cheer the faint and revive the dead. I am the guiding Light that illumineth the way. I am the royal Falcon on the arm of the Almighty. I unfold the drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight.\n\nThe incomparable Friend saith: The path to freedom hath been outstretched; hasten ye thereunto. The wellspring of wisdom is overflowing; quaff ye therefrom. Say: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. Verily I say, whatsoever leadeth to the decline of ignorance and the increase of knowledge hath been, and will ever remain, approved in the sight of the Lord of creation. Say: O people! Walk ye neath the shadow of justice and truthfulness and seek ye shelter within the tabernacle of unity.\n\nSay: O ye that have eyes to see! The past is the mirror of the future. Gaze ye therein and be apprised thereof; perchance ye may be aided thereby to recognize the Friend and may be not the cause of His displeasure. In this Day the choicest fruit of the tree of knowledge is that which serveth the welfare of humanity and safeguardeth its interests.\n\nSay: The tongue hath been created to bear witness to My truth; defile it not with falsehood. The heart is the treasury of My mystery; surrender it not into the hand of covetous desires. We fain would hope that in this resplendent morn, when the effulgent rays of the Sun of divine knowledge have enveloped the whole earth, we may all attain unto the good pleasure of the Friend and drink our fill from the ocean of His recognition.\n\nO friend! As hearing ears are scarce to find, the pen hath for some time remained silent in its quarters. In truth, matters have come to such a pass that silence hath taken precedence over utterance and hath come to be regarded as preferable. Say: O people! These words are being uttered in due measure, that the newly born may thrive and the tender shoot flourish. Milk should be given in suitable proportion, that the children of the world may attain to the station of maturity and abide in the court of oneness.\n\nO friend! We came upon a pure soil and sowed therein the seeds of true understanding. Let it now be seen what the rays of the sun will do--whether they will cause these seeds to wither or to grow. Say: Through the ascendancy of God, the All-Knowing, the Incomparable, the Luminary of divine understanding hath, in this Day, risen from behind the veil of the spirit, and the birds of every meadow are intoxicated with the wine of knowledge and exhilarated with the remembrance of the Friend. Well is it with them that discover and hasten unto Him!\n\n=== END BH00698 ===\n\n=== START BH00699 ===\n\nIn the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nThe verses have been sent down and the clear proofs have appeared, and the gate of the prison was opened after a numbered span of years, even as was foretold by the Lord of Eternity when the Seat of the Throne was established in the prison of 'Akka. Every learned one, every seeing one, and every fair-minded one beareth witness to the appearance of that which was uttered in the Book of God and His Tablets that were revealed aforetime. Blessed is he who hath read and recognized and testified, and woe unto every heedless one who hath denied that which hath appeared from God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nIn truth, neither pen is capable of recording nor tongue of expressing that which hath come to pass. With utmost clarity hath it been revealed in God's Book, and yet all remain heedless save those whom God hath aided. In the early days, the meaning of this blessed verse which He had previously revealed became manifest: \"Everything is perishable save His Face.\" This finite one existeth while all else is perishing and non-existent, as attested by His exalted Word: \"All that is thereon is perishable, and there remaineth but the face of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most-Bountiful.\"\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! Thou seest and knowest what hath befallen Thy loved ones at the hands of those who have denied all that hath appeared from Thee, and whose riches have so occupied them that they have cast behind their backs Thy Book, violated Thy Covenant, and disputed Thy verses. O Lord! Aid those who have entered prison for Thy Name's sake to be steadfast and patient, then ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the world to come and of this world, and that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Omnipotent. There is none other God but Thee, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Ali! The servant present here brought thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One. We heard and have answered, and verily We are the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nO Ali! The children of the earth are occupied with doubts and vain imaginings. The intoxication of heedlessness hath so seized them that they consider the world everlasting and themselves immortal. By the life of God! Soon will the hand of divine power purify the earth from the wicked. The fire of tyranny shall be quenched, and its kindler shall return to his abode. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\n\nThy letter testified to thy love, affection, devotion, humility and lowliness before God. Divine confirmations have reached thee and will continue to reach thee. Gird up the loins of service and counsel the friends of God as behooveth them on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Look not upon the transgressors and what they possess, but rather fix your gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon and what hath been ordained for you by the Pen of Command from the presence of the Ancient Ordainer. Let all hold fast to patience and forbearance, and seek from God, exalted be His glory. He hath granted victory and will continue to do so.\n\nWhere are they who drew their swords and arose in tyranny in such wise as caused the dwellers of the cities of justice and equity to lament? Throughout ages and centuries, the transgressors and oppressors have perpetrated that which caused every person of insight to weep and every possessor of a heart to wail. Nevertheless, exaltation, ascendancy and profit have been for the people of truth, while abasement, torment and loss have been for the enemies. Had they acted upon divine counsels, they would now behold the world as a tract of light. Although the darkness of oppression hath prevented some of the rays of the Sun of Justice, yet the Hand of Power shall manifest that which He hath willed. None hath the power to change or prevent it.\n\nRejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and be of the thankful ones. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to My firm cord.\n\nPraise be to God! The Sun of loving-kindness is shining and the Moon of grace is radiant. He chooseth whomsoever He willeth for whatsoever He pleaseth. None can prevent Him and none can resist Him. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth and withholdeth from whomsoever He desireth. He shall not be asked of His doings. He is, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nConcerning what was written about the prisoners, this is what was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur - exalted be His glory: \"O 'Abdu'l-Hadir! Make mention of 'Ali on Our behalf and gladden him with the favors of God. From his mention wafts the fragrance of love, and from his words his arising to serve the Cause is evident. I beseech God to protect him, to strengthen him, and to ordain for him that which shall profit him in this world and the next. Verily, He is the Lord of all created things, the Sovereign of the throne on high and of the earth below.\"\n\nOne should not be assured by the words of some. In the Land of Ta (Tehran), some took whatever they desired in this name, specifically for the release of prisoners, and afterwards no effect was manifest. God is the Concealer, He conceals from some. If they arrange to seize them after their release, there is and was no harm in this. Otherwise their affair rests with God, exalted be His glory. At one time this supreme utterance issued forth from the Dawning-Place of Names - blessed and exalted be His Word: \"O 'Abdu'l-Hadir! They have been imprisoned for the sake of God and have entered prison through their love for Him. This is a most great bounty, for God hath accepted this deed and attributed it to Himself. All the treasures of the world and the riches of the nations cannot equal it. If He willeth, He will release them as He hath released them time and again. O 'Abdu'l-Hadir! This imprisonment is beloved, for it is adorned with God's acceptance. This station is most exalted. By My life! If the manifestations of tyranny were to become aware of the station and loftiness of this prison, all would yearn for it. But alas! alas! These people are deprived of the spirit of inner meanings and barred from divine mysteries. Blessed is 'Ali, for he is steadfast in service and hath intended to serve. God willing, may all attain to that which befitteth this blessed Day. The friends in that land are all remembered in His presence, especially those souls who have arisen for God's sake and have been enabled to spend in His exalted path.\"\n\nThey smiled at the letter of that loved one and repeatedly accepted his intention with the adornment of acceptance. That which they forbade its execution - verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the All-Bountiful. Not an atom of good deeds and goodly words has been or will be lost. When these words of that loved one were presented, which stated \"With longing and hope, in complete humility and lowliness it was submitted that whatever is ordained in this matter, we are ready with utmost gratitude,\" They said: \"For God is his essence, for God is his deed, for God is his word, for God is his humility and submission and his turning unto Him.\"\n\nA hundred thousand praises be unto the Beloved of the worlds that His loved ones and friends are steadfast in service, blessed with His remembrance, adorned with His love, and embellished with His favors. Furthermore, this station has become evident and manifest like the greatest luminary, requiring no mention from this servant. In truth, this noble tradition \"The intention of the believer is better than his deed\" was and is for this station. It behooveth the tongue of the inmost heart and the head to say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled Thy loved ones to perform that which hath been adorned with the ornament of Thine acceptance. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. Thou givest and Thou withholdest, and Thou art indeed the Almighty, the Powerful.\"\n\nI send greetings and salutations to all the loved ones of that land, and I beseech them all that in their moments of leisure they forget not this evanescent one and pray on his behalf for divine confirmations and success. Similarly, this servant too, in the nighttime and during the day, before the throne of the Lord of all beings, has prayed and continues to pray for their confirmation and success. Verily our Lord, the All-Hearing, is the Answerer of prayers. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon the steadfast loved ones of God.\n\nThe Servant\n\n14 Shavval 1301\n\n=== END BH00699 ===\n\n=== START BH00700 ===\n\nHe is the Dawning Place from the Horizon of Proof\n\nThis is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down unto him who hath turned towards the horizon of His Cause, soared in His atmosphere and recognized that which most of the servants have rejected. He is, verily, of those who have turned towards God.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Hearken unto My Voice from My direction: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and the servant who standeth before the Face hath presented it. We have answered thee with a Tablet whereunto the tablets of the world and whatsoever is with the nations cannot be compared. To this beareth witness the Lord of the world Who uttereth at all times: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Possessor of this glorious and wondrous Day!\"\n\nBe thou vocal in the praise and remembrance of God, and steadfast in the service of His Cause whereby the hearts of the learned were perturbed and the dwellers of the cities of names have lamented, save those whom thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous, hath willed. Say: This is the Day wherein the Mother Book hath been sent down, did ye but know it, and the Mother of the Bayan hath come, as attested by Him with Whom is the Preserved Tablet.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful, and turn not away from Him by Whom the horizon of divine knowledge hath been illumined and the Nightingale warbleth upon the branches. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. By God! The Bayan was sent down for My remembrance, the Book for My Name, and the Tablets for this irrevocable Cause. Say: Your clamor shall not prevent Me, nor the clamor of those on earth. I call out before the faces of the world and speak that which I have been commanded by the Lord of Eternity. To this bear witness My deeds and My call, but the people do not understand.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of My loved ones there, that the remembrance of their Lord may draw them to the most exalted station.\n\nO Ghaffar! The Chosen One maketh mention of thee when the wicked surrounded Him from every direction. I am He Who hath arisen with God's Cause amidst the world and have manifested that which I was commanded before the faces of all people. When the Cause was revealed, there emerged from behind the veils certain wicked ones who desired to shed My blood without any proof or book.\n\nO Yahya! The Book hath come; take hold of it with strength from Us and follow not those who have violated God's Covenant and His Testament, and who have disbelieved in that which hath been sent down from the presence of a Mighty, All-Knowing One. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Our horizon when most of the servants turned away. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth as a grace from Our presence, and We are the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO Nur-Muhammad! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison quarter and giveth thee glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for thee from the Most Exalted Pen. Rejoice and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names! Thou art He Who hath manifested Himself for the life of the world and hath called all unto the Dayspring of bounty. Those who have turned away, they shall have no portion of this Most Great Sea. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in the most exalted station. Blessed is the face that hath turned unto the Face of God and the heart that hath turned towards Him on a Day wherein feet have slipped.\n\nO Muhammad-Husayn! Hearken unto the call from the Lote-Tree beyond the Sea of Grandeur: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Chosen One. I have come from the Dayspring of certitude with the standards of divine knowledge. Among the people are those who have turned towards God and those who have turned away - and he who turneth away is assuredly among the companions of the Fire. We counsel thee and those who have believed to show forth the utmost steadfastness in this Cause whereby the hearts of the wicked have been perturbed.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who is named 'Abbas-Quli that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and be of the thankful ones. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having sent down unto me Thy verses and manifested unto me Thy clear tokens, and for having aided me to turn towards Thee. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the sun of Thy bounty to make me steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nO Ali! The Lord of creation makes mention of thee at a time when the hosts of the wicked have encompassed Him, and He reveals unto thee that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Take heed lest the might of the powerful weaken thee in the Cause of God, the Lord of Names, or the power of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the All-Praised, cause thee to fear. Arise with such steadfastness as will cause the hearts of the opposers to tremble.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of Abdul-Ali and give him glad tidings of the favors of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. We counsel him to remember God and praise Him, and to that whereby His mighty and wondrous Cause may be exalted. Arise to serve the Cause in the name of God, thy Lord, and say: O people of the Bayan! By God, its Revealer and Sender hath come. Fear ye the All-Merciful and be not of the wrongdoers. Do ye deny the Ocean and regard the drop as an ocean apart from Me? Ye are indeed of the ignorant ones. By God, he who denieth this Cause cannot prove any other cause. The Books of God, both past and future, bear witness to this. Be fair and be not of the transgressors. We counsel thee to remember and praise God on this Day wherein the opposers have arisen in manifest sedition.\n\nO Muhammad! The One, the Single, makes mention of thee from this most exalted Station that He may draw thee unto the supreme height. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's favor and cling to His resplendent hem. Say: O my God and my Desire! I beseech Thee by the hidden and treasured mysteries, by Thy revealed verses and Thy manifest and brilliant evidences, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can weaken. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.\n\nWe make mention in this station of him who is named Aqa Bala that the utterance of the All-Merciful may attract him to the supreme horizon and draw him nigh unto Him in all conditions. Blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancies and taken hold of that which he was bidden by God, the Lord of Lords. Thy name was presented before the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names and supreme attributes. He unto whom is given the knowledge of the Book beareth witness to this. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of verses! I beseech Thee to strengthen me in steadfastness in Thy Cause in such wise that the power of the wicked may not move me.\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! My Most Exalted Pen makes mention of thee in this fortress built of smoothed rock. When thou attainest unto this remembrance and perceivest from it the fragrance of My loving-kindness, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast turned toward me from the direction of the prison, and thanks be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast mentioned me in such wise as to enrapture the hearts of the righteous. We counsel thee and them that have believed to observe trustworthiness, religious devotion, chastity, and that whereby God's Cause may be promoted amongst His servants. Seize hold of that which hath been revealed unto thee with such strength as the hands of the infidels who have broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and have turned away from the Countenance when it appeared from the heaven of utterance with wisdom and clear proof, are powerless to withstand.\n\nO Tongue of My Grandeur! Make mention of him who is named Muhibb-'Ali and give him glad tidings of verses that are unequalled by aught in the private or public domain. Blessed is he who, though seated, hath arisen to serve the Cause, and he who, though disobedient, hath hastened to the ocean of forgiveness. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken while the Wronged One was in the most sublime station.\n\nAnd We make mention of My handmaidens in that land and give them glad tidings of God's favor and bounty which have encompassed all who are in earth and heaven. Rejoice, O My leaves, in My remembrance and My loving-kindness and My mercy that have preceded all created things. By My life! The treasures of the earth cannot equal My remembrance. He with whom is the Mother Book doth testify to this.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! We have made mention of thee at the outset, and have mentioned every name that was recorded in thy book, and have sealed the Tablet with thy name. Rejoice thou and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who causeth the rivers to flow! I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all created things. O my Lord! I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which is best for me. Thou knowest what is within my soul, while I know not what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nThe servant who is present hath appeared and visited the Throne in thy stead, and hath attained the ornament of acceptance from the Wronged One, Who hath proclaimed before the faces of the world: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sender of the winds.\" Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me when I was wronged at the hands of the ignorant. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee, to grant thee success, and to ordain for thee the best of what hath been sent down in the Holy Books and Tablets.

By your guidance the thirsty hastened to the onrushing waters of everlasting life and the sinner to the vivifying river of forgiveness and mercy. Ye are the signs of God and His straight Path amongst His creation. Through you all faces turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and every poor one sought the Wellspring of wealth. At your suffering all things lamented, and every atom cried out between earth and heaven, and Adam forsook the Most Exalted Paradise and chose for Himself a place upon the dust. Ye are the dawning-places of power amidst the people and the daysprings of might amongst the righteous. Through you the springtime of inner meaning appeared in the world of utterance and the All-Merciful shed His effulgent splendour upon all created things. Ye are the hands of His Cause in His lands, and the stars of His bountiful care amidst His servants. Through you the daystars of knowledge dawned forth, the heavens of all religions were illumined, the lights of the sciences shone brightly amongst the nations, and the sphere of the arts was expanded throughout the world. Ye are the dawning-places of God's Revelation upon the earth and the daysprings of His signs in the world of creation. By your arising did the people arise to serve the Cause and the river of mercy flow out amidst humankind. Ye are the pearls of the Hidden Sea and the letters of the Treasured Book. Through your sublime word the Book of Names was expounded and the portals of blessings were opened wide before the inhabitants of earth and heaven. Through you the injunction \"Be thou\" was enforced, the Hidden Secret was divulged, and the choice Wine was unsealed.\n\nAlas, alas! By reason of your sorrow, the inmates of the all-highest Paradise were overcome with grief and the denizens of the kingdom of names were moved to lament. At your suffering, trembling seized the inhabitants of the Verdant Isle on the shore of the Sea of Grandeur, causing the sighs of such as are wholly devoted to God to ascend and the tears of them that are nigh unto Him to rain down. Ye are the books of God and His scriptures, the epistles of God and His tablets. By virtue of your gladness the faces of all beings were wreathed in smiles, and by reason of your sorrow all things visible and invisible did wail aloud. Ye are the arks of God sailing upon the ocean of His Will, and the people of God who have arisen to champion His Cause. Through you the Most Great Announcement was proclaimed and the limbs of all men were made to tremble. Through your call every sleeping one was awakened, every seated one rose up, and every reclining one rushed forth. Through that call the negligent were raised from slumber, the ignorant were enlightened, the agitated were assured, and the tongue of every stammerer was unloosed. Through your sweet remembrance all people hastened to the Most Exalted Horizon and the Crimson Ark sailed upon the sea of names. Ye are the dawning-places of the Will of God and the daysprings of His Cause, the embodiments of His command and the sources of His might. Ye are the storehouses of His knowledge and the treasuries of His secrets, the repositories of His decree and the exponents of His behest. Ye are the pearls of the ocean of His generosity and the gems of the mines of His munificence, the suns of the firmament of His grace and the moons of the heaven of His bounty. Through you the banner \"He, verily, is God\" was hoisted upon the earth and every stranger came to recognize his ultimate goal and his true abode. Through your allegiance did the pure in heart rush to the field of martyrdom and offer up that which they possessed in the path of God, the Lord of all names. Through you did they who enjoy near access to God attain unto the living waters of immortality, and the true believers unto that which hath flowed forth from the Luminous Spot in the All-Highest Paradise before the Divine Lote-Tree.\n\nI testify that through you the breeze of the All-Merciful passed over all created things and the sweet savour of the All-Glorious wafted over all regions. Through you the Throne was established upon the land of Za'faran and the God of Mercy seated Himself thereupon. Through you the heaven of certitude shone resplendent and all things were moved to proclaim, \"The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the Beneficent!\" Through your names the suns of inner meaning dawned above the horizons of utterance, and the streams of divine wisdom flowed in the gardens of true understanding. Ye are those inner meanings that can neither be apprehended through words nor expressed through speech. Blessed is the poor one who hath set out towards the orient of your wealth, the thirsty one who hath hastened to the shores of the ocean of your favours, the lowly one who hath sought the court of your glory, the ignorant one who hath looked to the dawning-place of your knowledge, the distressed one who hath drawn nigh unto the tabernacle of your majesty and the pavilion of your grace, the ailing one who hath longed for the heavenly river of your healing, the weak one who hath turned to the kingdom of your might, and the friend who hath reached the soft-flowing stream of reunion with you and been honoured with your presence, which excelleth all that hath been fashioned in the universe or appeared in the realm of creation. Great indeed is the blessedness of the wayward one who hath rushed to the dayspring of your guidance, the slumbering one who hath been awakened through your remembrance, the dead one who hath been stirred by the breezes of your utterance and adorned with the ornament of life beneath your shadow, the seated one who hath arisen in your service, the eloquent one who hath celebrated your praise and turned to the fountain of your generosity, and the rebellious one who through your intercession hath reached the ocean of forgiveness. Through the sweet call you raised did all things draw nigh unto God, the Possessor of all names, and by your turning to the Most Exalted Horizon did all faces turn towards the dawning-place of the bounty of your Lord, the All-Glorious. Through you the treasures of all names were brought forth amongst the people. Through you the hearts of His ardent lovers were set ablaze in the world of creation.\n\nThe glory that hath dawned from the horizon of Mine utterance rest upon you and upon whomsoever hath turned towards you and fixed his gaze on the court of your glory. Through you the Dove of Eternity chanted and the birds of the Throne of glory warbled amongst the peoples, the seas surged and the winds blew, the lights were shed abroad and the skies were illumined. Through you the celestial Bird sounded its call, that which had been hidden was disclosed, the irrevocable decree was fulfilled, and the Hand of Mercy passed round the sealed wine. Through you the morn of certitude dawned forth, the lamp of vain imaginings was extinguished, and the gates of inspiration were flung open. Through you the secrets of the Book were divulged and the veils were rent asunder. Through you the emerald-green Nightingale warbled upon the Crimson Tree, testifying to that whereunto God Himself did testify ere the creation of earth and heaven. Ye are the waves of this Sea through which every other sea hath surged and the mercy of God hath appeared in every land. I bear witness that ye are rivers branching out from the Most Great Ocean, luminous moons rising above the horizon of the world, and radiant lights shining upon its peoples. God hath made each of you a bough of this Ancient Root; an exponent of this glorious, this veiled and weighty Secret; a manifestation of His most noble Name; and a sign of His all-embracing grace. Well is it with him that hath been blessed by your breath during your lives and guided by your example after your deaths. Through you God's bounty was fulfilled, His mercy encompassed all things, His testimony was established, His heavenly sustenance was sent down, His Word was perfected, His breeze was wafted, and His proofs shone resplendent amidst all creation. By your suffering, the kindreds of the cities of names were seized with agitation, the Pen of the Most High wailed aloud, the inmates of the loftiest Paradise were sorely vexed, the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree withered, the Maids of heaven swooned away in their crimson chambers, the atoms of the universe cried out between earth and heaven, and the movement of the Pen of the Most Great Name was stilled in the realms of remembrance and praise. Blessed is the one who hath been illumined with the light of your faces, hath drawn nigh unto the precincts of your court and circled round you, hath visited your resting-places and taken refuge with you, hath cleaved to the cord of your grace and held fast to the hem of your bounty, hath striven to the utmost in your path and suffered martyrdom for the sake of your love.\n\nThrough you the Supreme Horizon was illumined and all faces turned to God, the Lord of all Names. Through you were manifested His sovereignty and His might, His majesty and His grandeur. Ye are the lights of the Kingdom, the secrets of the Celestial Dominion, and the daysprings of the Cause of God in this nether world. Through you the sun of utterance shone forth, the ocean of understanding appeared, the heaven of certitude was upraised, and the throne of the All-Merciful was established in the realm of being. Blessed are ye--the origin of your beings and their end, your outer temples and inner selves--and blessed is whosoever hath drawn nigh unto you and visited your graves, held fast to the cord of your favours, and clung firmly to the hem of the robe of your bestowals.\n\nLauded be Thy name, O Lord of Being and Possessor of all things visible and invisible! I beseech Thee by the showers of Thy mercy, through which Thy bounties and favours were manifested unto Thy servants, and by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom, to forgive me, and my parents, and every servant who hath clung firmly to this exalted station and hastened to this sublime habitation.\n\nI entreat Thee, O my Lord, by that Word wherewith Thou hast subdued the hearts of Thy chosen ones, to satisfy my needs and make me steadfast in Thy Cause, with my eyes fixed upon Thy horizon, wholly rid of all attachment to such as have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs.\n\nO Lord! Thou seest Thy servant hastening to the ocean of Thy forgiveness, desiring only that which Thou hast ordained for them that love Thee. Thou art, in truth, that All-Powerful One Whom the pursuits of Thy servants can never frustrate nor the clamour of the people deter from Thy purpose. Thou doest, through the power of Thy might, what Thou willest, and ordainest as Thou pleasest. Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.\n\n=== END BH00704 ===\n\n=== START BH00705 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great!\n\nThese are the verses of God, the True King, the Manifest One, sent down from the heaven of mighty exaltation. Worship none but Him and turn to the direction of His favor - this is the straight path. O people! Consider the proofs and signs of God from before, that ye may be convinced that He is indeed the One Who hath appeared with truth in these days. Yet most people remain behind a mighty veil.\n\nSay: O people! We sent forth the First Creation by Our command, and We made him a Word, and We sent him to earth and made him the father of all creation. We gave him progeny from Our presence and made them inheritors. Then when ages and epochs passed, We sent forth Noah from Our presence to guide people unto God and give them glad tidings of these days. We commanded him to take from the people of earth a covenant concerning this Manifestation.\n\nHe said: \"O people! Fear God and be not of those who join partners with Him. Your God is one God. Worship none but Him.\" They opposed him and denied Him Who sent him with truth. At every moment he was afflicted with hardship and adversity in God's path - the King, the Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing - until We delivered him and those with him, and drowned the evil-doing people who were among the losers.\n\nThen after him We sent forth Hud and sent him to Our heedless servants. He said: \"O people! Fear God! I have come to you from the Dawning Place of the Cause with momentous tidings. Worship none but Him and be not of those who join partners with Him.\" They denied him and harmed him at all times, and We were witness and aware of what they did, until We sent against them a furious wind and destroyed them, save Our sincere servants.\n\nThen We sent forth Salih with a word from Our presence and sent him to his people to remind them of the remembrance of God, their Lord and the Lord of all worlds. He said: \"O people! I have come to you from God your Lord. Join no partners with Him but worship Him sincerely, and wrong no one by so much as a grain's weight. Be just among yourselves and be not of the corrupt.\" They were not guided by the lights of guidance. They rejected him and denied Him Who sent him with truth, and were among the wrongdoers. We destroyed them with a single cry and made them a lesson for others.\n\nThen after him We sent forth the Friend (Abraham) and gave him ten scrolls from Our presence and sent him to Nimrod and his chiefs to remind them of the days of God and guide them to this clear and luminous path. He said: \"O people! God hath sent me to you and hath sent down unto me from His presence verses of mighty exaltation. Differ not concerning His Cause and follow not the ways of those who join partners with Him. Answer God's summoner among you and be not of the heedless.\" They made God's Cause an object of mockery and were not among the believers, until We destroyed Nimrod and his people and made the Friend an enduring Word from Our presence among the worlds.\n\nThen after him We sent forth Him Who conversed with God (Moses) with clear signs and made him a proof unto all in the heavens and earth. We sent him to Pharaoh and his chiefs. He came before him and said: \"I have come to thee from the Dawning Place of glory and power with a clear authority. Fear God and join no partners with Him, and be not of the heedless.\" He waxed proud before God and opposed Him Who conversed with God, following the ways of Satan, until the sorcerers gathered at an appointed time on a known day, as We have sent down in the scrolls of old. We effaced sorcery and confirmed that which was given to Him Who conversed with God from Our presence \\[...\\]\n\nI am the All-Powerful, the Almighty. We commanded him to depart with the Children of Israel, and when he departed, Pharaoh and his hosts pursued them from behind to seize them unjustly. We drowned them and delivered those who believed in God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Then after him We sent forth the Spirit and dispatched him unto mankind with a wondrous command. He said: \"O people! Believe in Him Who sent me unto you, and be not of the unbelievers.\" And when his cause grew difficult, We raised him by the sovereignty of might and power unto a heaven of exalted glory. Then We sent after him Muhammad, the Messenger of God, with a perspicuous Book, and through him We distinguished between truth and falsehood, if ye be of them that know. We made him a mercy unto all the worlds, for whenever tribulation and adversity touched him in the path of God, he remained patient within himself. Therefore did We name him the Beloved in My great dominion, and We said unto him on the night of his ascension: \"Thou art the Beloved and thou art the Well-Beloved.\" We revealed unto him a light from the lights of this Manifestation, if ye be of the assured ones. Then We raised up the Sovereign of the Messengers, who was named Ali in all the tablets, and through him We opened the gates of grace unto the faces of all created things. We made him the herald of this Manifestation. He said: \"O people! When the Beloved of the worlds cometh unto you, beware lest ye hesitate in His Manifestation and cling to what ye possess from the tidings of the ancients. Verily, I have revealed the Bayan for His sake and made it as a leaf among the leaves of Paradise for Him. Beware lest ye differ concerning His wondrous Cause. Follow not your leaders at the time of His appearance, for on that Day the affairs of the worlds shall be changed, and the followers of the Mount shall perish at the dawning of a drop from that crimson Light rising from the Most Glorious Horizon. Fear God and be not of them that are veiled. O people! I have come to you to announce the meeting with God on the Day when the clouds shall be cleft asunder and the Lord of Lords shall come with hosts from the envoys of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Beware lest ye look upon Him with your eyes or the eyes of your leaders. Look upon Him with His eye; thus have I been commanded by God, your Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds. O people! He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Being. He shall come unto you with the truth, with a manifest and evident Command. Every good mention revealed in the Bayan hath no purpose except His Self. Await His days, O people of unity! Were it not for Him, I would not have revealed the Bayan nor manifested Myself amongst you, if ye be of the assured ones. I have made every matter dependent upon His leave. Beware in the days of His manifestation lest ye cling to what hath been revealed in the Bayan and its letters. Fear God, O people, and be not of them that cling. On that Day, detach yourselves from all that ye possess and turn with your hearts unto My Beloved and the Beloved of the Concourse on High, My Purpose and the Purpose of the hearts of them that know. Beware, beware, O people, lest ye grieve Him in anything or commit that which would sadden His most gentle and tender heart. Prepare yourselves for meeting Him in His days. By God! His Day is the Sovereign of Days, and He is the King of the former and latter generations.\" Thus did We reveal in the Bayan through the tongue of Ali aforetime, and We were in truth a witness unto him. Verily, he delivered the messages of his Lord unto the servants with most wondrous utterance, were ye of them that perceive. But when the promise came to pass and God came with the truth, then did the people of the Bayan deny Him, save those whom God preserved through a power from His presence, and verily He is unto His servants All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And among the opposers was he who said that He had fabricated lies against God \\[...\\]\n\nAmong them were those who objected, and those who united with them that pronounced their verdict against the Primal Point for my injury, and those who arose to slay me, and those who forbade the servants from my love and my remembrance. Thus did I remain bewildered amidst these idolaters. And were I to recount what hath befallen me, the hearts of the sincere would be consumed. Thus do I sit in prison and await what may transpire, and I fear no one nor am I dismayed though the harm of all the world should touch me. Thus have We revealed unto thee, O servant, that thou mayest detach thyself from all that thou hast and arise to serve the Cause of God and to make mention of Him amongst His servants. And I am, verily, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Stand firm through God's might and power, then turn thy face toward the people of the Bayan and say: O people! Be ye ashamed before Him Who hath given you the glad tidings of this Manifestation, and be not of them who disbelieved after having believed. Fear God and be not among the losers. Verily, He Who hath come unto you hath appeared with all the signs, and none deny Him save every sinful detractor. Fear God and make not your deeds void and follow not the evil ones. Thus have We commanded thee and revealed unto thee. Act thou according to what thou hast been bidden and be not of the silent ones. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and have detached themselves from the idolaters. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00705 ===\n\n=== START BH00707 ===\n\nHong Kong. May the honored Mr. Afnan of the Blessed Tree, His Holiness Haji Mirza Buzurg, upon him be all the Glory of God, be observed by the Most Luminous Gaze.\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord\n\nPraise, glorification, thanksgiving and splendor belong exclusively to the True Thankful One, Who through this Most Exalted Word summoned His servants to the supreme heights, as He, exalted be He, saith: \"Be thankful unto Me and I will be thankful unto you.\" Were one to comprehend the sweetness of this utterance, he would seek the True Intended One. Glory be to God! What days are passing while the servants remain heedless thereof. Today the gate of grace is opened wide and the lights of the Luminary of utterance, the Desire of all worlds, have embraced the world; yet despite this, they remain occupied with vain imaginings and deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of proof. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist His servants to turn towards the gate of His bounty. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. My spirit be a sacrifice for your orientation and your drawing nigh!\n\nThe blessed letters, of which in truth every character was a key to the gate of joy, arrived. God is aware how much gladness and delight was attained. In truth, at this station the tongue is forbidden to set limits. And after attaining unto it and comprehending the meanings concealed therein, it sought the most exalted station and the Most Glorious Throne. After permission was granted, it was presented. His blessed and exalted Word: \"O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness!\" By God's life, thou hast been and art mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Today the divine treasures and the repositories of eternal wealth are present and visible, and in the nights and days, from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen, the pearls of wisdom and utterance specifically for the Afnan are made manifest. No thanks befitteth this most exalted station, and no praise attaineth unto this most glorious rank. However, purely through grace and loving-kindness, the Tongue of Grandeur hath, on behalf of His Afnan, offered praise and thanks. Glorious is His bounty and mighty His bestowal! There is none to enrich save Him, and none to give save Him.\n\nO My Afnan! In this year there occurred that which caused the most great consternation, but God made it a support for His Cause and an aid for the exaltation of His Word. Though outwardly it was grievous, inwardly it contained incalculable mercy and loving-kindness for those assured, steadfast and firmly-rooted souls, and for all the peoples of the world. Soon will its fruits become manifest and evident, and through it God will elevate the stations of those who are near and sincere, and abase the stations of the polytheists and the antagonists. Repeatedly have your letters attained the Most Holy Court, and from them wafted the fragrance of love, steadfastness, submission and contentment, especially in this year. Well is it with thee and pleasant it is to thee! Say \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused one of Thy Afnan to turn unto Thee, who hath believed in Thee and Thy sovereignty, and hath quaffed the choice wine of knowledge from the cup of Thy bounty and the Kawthar of life from the chalice of Thy nearness and presence. I testify that Thou hast raised me to a station which the hands of Thy creation can never attain. I beseech Thee at this moment, by Thy manifest light, Thy straight path, and Thy momentous announcement, to ordain for me that which shall endure as long as Thy most excellent names and exalted attributes endure. O Lord! Transform the losses of Thy loved ones into the greatest gain, then set right their affairs through Thy grace, O Thou Who art the Lord of eternity and Who art manifest through the Most Great Name. By Thy might, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things, I love to stand at all times before the gate of Thy grandeur and the throne of Thy commandments and ordinances, and to hear Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen before Thy face, O Lord of all humanity and Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. O Lord! Take my hand with the hands of Thy power, then preserve me from the evil of Thine enemies who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs, and who have denied Thy Manifestation and Thy proof. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Generous.\n\nThe servant who is present hath appeared and presented before the Face that which thou didst send. We have answered thee through this sealed Book and have mentioned thee in this witnessed Tablet. Today what is essential is the Afnan's adherence to that which preserveth their stations. Praise be to God, the Word of God is mentioned and effective in all regions. The rulers of the earth, may God assist them, have sought merely to be informed of the laws of this Most Great Manifestation, and they were sent. Although at present no matter worthy of mention is evident, there is no doubt that hereafter the exaltation of the Most Great Word and the elevation of the stations of His loved ones will become clear and manifest to all like unto the sun. This Wronged One hath never regarded any matter or thing except the manifestation of that which indicateth detachment from all else save God. For this ocean there must needs be ships, and for this heaven countless suns are ordained, and for this Book innumerable books are recorded and written. The Mother Book in this exalted and glorious station beareth witness unto this. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Cause be upon you and upon those who are with you and upon those who love you and recognize your station from God, the Ancient of Days.\n\nThe very utterance of the Desired One of all worlds is a true testimony and an eloquent witness to the grace, favor, mercy and kindness of God, exalted be His glory, towards the Afnan. No expositor is needed. The Praiser and Describer hath been and is God Himself, exalted be His glory. In truth, the people of the world cannot be said to possess ears, for had they possessed them, they would not have remained deprived and veiled. It is a cause for a hundred thousand regrets that despite the descent of the heavenly food of wisdom and utterance and the bounty of meanings and exposition, all are occupied with their own treacheries and vain imaginings. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds in this vain life. Verily our Lord is the Just, the Wise. They have abandoned the station wherein naught is seen save the mention of God and His verses and evidences, and are circling round the dawning-places of heedlessness and ignorance. In all circumstances, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to forgive all and not to deprive them of the Salsabil of utterance and the Kawthar of knowledge in His days. He is the Mighty Bestower.\n\nPraise be to God, the Land of Purpose and its surroundings remain tranquil until now. Although the followers of the Shi'ih sect consider the people of these parts to be infidels, nevertheless they outwardly show love. His Majesty the Sultan of these realms--may God, the Blessed, the Most High, assist him and strengthen his government--has shown the utmost kindness toward the great claimant of Iran. Twice were matters sent to his presence, and both times he responded favorably and as desired. Although his honor Afnan, Aqa Siyyid Ahmad--upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God--counted the great personage among the loved ones, his inner reality differed from his outward appearance. Finally, from the Most Holy Presence the secrets of his heart were revealed that they might be aware. After his dismissal he showed love, even to the point of consulting the Dayspring of Divine Knowledge regarding his affairs. The dismissal of the governor took place and although he was not, and is not, free from temporizing, yet he came to realize the harmlessness and peaceful nature of this community. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist all and confirm them in that which is the cause of salvation for all. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nThe Branches of the Blessed Tree--may my spirit be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps--each showed kindness, and likewise the various groups and those who circle round all expressed that from which wafted the fragrance of love. Furthermore, whatever was sent during this period has all arrived and been graciously accepted. Well done to your honor, and congratulations to your honor. To the presence of the honored Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree--upon them be, from every direction, His most glorious splendor--I offer mention, praise, glory and light, and I beseech God, exalted be His station, to manifest through them that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. Verily our Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and the Fulfiller of the needs of every seeker who takes refuge in Him. Glory, praise, mention and exaltation be upon your honor and upon those who love you, remember you, and through you draw near unto God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of this noble station and the resplendent horizon.\n\nThe Servant\n\n27 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1309\n\n=== END BH00707 ===\n\n=== START BH00708 ===\n\nGod the Blessed, the Exalted, hath revealed unto certain of His Prophets in some of His revelations: \"By My glory and majesty! I shall assuredly sever all hope of any who hopeth in aught but Me, and shall clothe him with the garment of humiliation before all people, and shall remove him far from My grace and My relief. Doth My servant look to others in times of hardship when the key thereof is in My hands? How is it that I see My servant turning away from Me when I have given him what he hath not asked of Me? Shall one ask and I not be generous? Nay! Do not bounty and generosity belong to Me? Are not this world and the next in My hands? Were each one of the inhabitants of the heavens to ask of Me the like of the heavens and earth, and were I to grant his wish, this would not diminish from My dominion even to the extent of a gnat's wing.\"\n\nSuch utterances as these, most of which do not now come to mind, continually streamed forth from the Fountain of the All-Merciful's mouth. The cups of utterance have been filled with the wine of thy Lord's remembrance, the All-Merciful. That which remaineth in this servant's memory hath been submitted. How can I describe how the verses of power, majesty and sovereignty were revealed and made manifest on that blessed night? It was as though the Salsabil of utterance was bestowed upon all creation, and the ocean of generosity washed over all nations, and the Mystery veiled in mystery was revealed unto all who dwell in the realm of the seen and unseen. Many utterances have entirely passed from memory.\n\nThen at the seventh hour, one of the officers came and took away the Ancient Beauty, the two Most Great Branches, and Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Quli. As mentioned in the previous petition, the Ancient Beauty and the Greater Branch were placed in a location adjacent to the prison, Aqay-i-Aqa in another place, and His Holiness the Most Great Branch in the prison under chains. This servant and the other loved ones were imprisoned under chains in a very dark place within the building itself. On the second night a telegram arrived from the governor and they changed the location of the Ancient Beauty to an elevated dome above the prison. The two Most Great Branches and Aqay-i-Aqa were in His most holy presence. After thirty-eight and a half hours in the dome, again on Thursday at the fourth hour after sunrise they were summoned to the building for questioning. While proceeding to the assembly, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words: \"Ye have taken your own principles and cast the principles of God behind your backs. Why do ye not understand?\" This verse was repeatedly uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur. After the Ancient Beauty's arrival, the Pasha and the members of the assembly apologized, saying they were obliged to investigate since three people had been killed and all the inhabitants of the city were fearful and terrified, therefore they must proceed according to law. The poor man seemed to have no knowledge of the law. In any case, they asked about His blessed name and homeland, explaining that according to law these questions must be asked and recorded. He said: \"It is more manifest than the sun.\" They asked again. He said: \"It behooveth not to mention the name. Look at the government decree which is in your possession.\" Then with utmost courtesy they requested that He Himself tell them. The Temple of Grandeur sat composed upon the chair and spoke with the tongue of power and might: \"My name is Baha'u'llah and My country is Nur. Be ye apprized of it.\" Then the Ancient Face turned toward the Mufti and spoke, mighty in His grandeur: \"Had ye but known, We would have caused you to hear the cooing of the Dove of Glory upon the branch of the Divine Lote-Tree, that ye might perceive what servitude hath spoken - that essence whose inmost reality is lordship.\" Those present were struck dumb by this eternal Word of God. Then, addressing all, He said: \"What is the purpose of this gathering, this question and answer? If ye wish to acknowledge what is your true purpose and the desire of your hearts - for I do not wish to remain in this world even for an hour.\" And He recited verses from the Surih of the Kings, including this blessed passage: \"I have never passed by a tree, but My heart addressed it saying: 'O would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee for My Lord's sake.'\" During this utterance, the pillars of the All-Merciful were seized with trembling. Then He arose and the Beauty of Youth turned toward another place outside the gathering. Indeed, what a wondrous day and remarkable time it was! In some souls the Sun of the Word of God had dawned and they showed forth their love. In truth, this servant is powerless to recount the divine utterances. The author of the Mathnavi has spoken words fitting for this station:\n\n\"Those words the Prophet spoke in that moment\n\nIf cast upon night would turn it to dawn\n\nThat night would become bright as morning-tide\n\nThose holy words I cannot now describe\n\nThou knowest what the sun in Aries\n\nSpeaks to the flowers with pure sincerity\n\nThou knowest what the crystal waters say\n\nUnto the flowers and saplings day by day\"\n\nIn truth, this servant was and will ever be powerless to recount the divine utterances and heavenly expressions. Afterward, the Pasha sent word requesting His return to the house and apologized for what had transpired. He said return to the prison was preferable, as many were imprisoned there. Some who were present before Him submitted that the townspeople were in commotion and the prisoners could not be brought out; it would be better to wait some days. Then He returned to the house, and this was at the eleventh hour on Thursday. In brief, from the time of the Ancient Beauty's departure from the sanctuary until His return, sixty-nine and a half hours had elapsed: five and a half hours' stay in the seray the first night, eighteen and a half hours in the prison near the barracks, thirty hours in the domed chamber above the barracks \\[...\\]\n\nAnd a half hour in prison next to Limon; eighteen and a half hours above Limon's dome; thirty-eight and a half hours arrival at the barracks and staying there a second time for seven hours. Thus was the matter decreed by God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Furthermore, there is one named Sohbat from the people of Za' - upon him be God's curse - when he invented lies, when he made promises he broke them, and when he was trusted he betrayed. These are the attributes of the hypocrites, and a hundred thousand times worse than these exist in that vile one. Before the occurrence of these mentioned events, he arrived in this land and dwelt in the abode of the polytheists, and for some time associated with evil souls, then returned with false and erroneous reports. In every place he reached, he mentioned calumnies. He and Aqa Jan - upon both be God's wrath - became narrators of fabricated calumnies from false sources. Thus after the upheavals in the great city and the dismissal of Mushir and death of the Grand Vizier, they attributed these events as having occurred due to the oppression against Us, and claimed that the chief of the polytheists had foretold these matters - all of this is pure falsehood. Any fair-minded person who has attained even a portion of justice would testify to their lies, for all souls from among the Arabs, Persians and Turks were pursuing the Ancient Beauty and had risen up in complete enmity, and they did not consider others to even exist, and whatever befell others was merely incidental. In any case, the seizure of the oppressors and what befell them and what will befall them has all been revealed with perfect clarity in the Tablet of Ra'is and other Tablets, and now this servant mentions some of these so all may know that those souls were and will be liars, and that the Dawning-Place of divine verses and Source of merciful outpourings had foretold what would occur. Among these is the Tablet of Ibn-i-Nabil - upon him be the Glory of God - which was revealed upon first arrival at the Most Great Prison, and the original is with the aforementioned person and copies of it are with Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin - upon him be the Glory of God - and the loved ones. Let them seek it out and investigate so they may know with certainty that the reins of knowledge have been in the hands of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. None knoweth the unseen except Him; He revealeth to whom He willeth and concealeth from whom He willeth what He willeth. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH00708 ===\n\n=== START BH00709 ===\n\nThe Beloved of God in Nayriz\n\nHe is the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the All-Bountiful on a day whereon the tribes lamented, the earth was cleft asunder, and the mountains were swept away - unto those who have drunk of the Kawthar of divine knowledge in the days of the All-Merciful in such wise that they turned their faces toward Him, directed their steps unto Him, and spoke His praise with their tongues, that they might rejoice in this Remembrance through which the graves have risen up and the Herald hath called out: \"O beloved of the All-Merciful in the Nun and the Ya! Hearken unto the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree which speaketh from the loftiest station: 'Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.'\"\n\nWe hear the remembrances of those who have turned toward the Supreme Horizon, and We behold the deeds of every believer who hath attained the light of certitude. Beware lest the veils of earth withhold you or the protests of those who have pronounced judgment against God, the Lord of Lords, prevent you. How many a learned one hath prided himself on My Name amongst My servants, yet when I manifested Myself, turned away and disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Final End. They make mention of God in their mosques and temples, yet when He appeared with grace, they turned from Him and rose up against Him with such tyranny as caused every angel to cry out and the denizens of Paradise to lament in their most exalted gardens.\n\nBe ye the helpers of God on earth and His trusted ones in every land. Thus doth the Wronged One command you from the presence of God, the Lord of Creation. Adorn yourselves with the ornament of wisdom among all people and speak with pure truthfulness. He commandeth you that which shall profit you in the Hereafter and in this world. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO letters of the Book of God's love! Behold, then remember what befell the chosen ones in the land of ?ad, when the wolf howled throughout the land. Verily, the Baqir pronounced judgment against the children of the Messenger with such tyranny as caused the leaves to fall and the trees to lament. Blessed is My name, the ?a', who hastened to the place of sacrifice with spirit and joy. We make mention of him and his brother and those who drank the choice wine of martyrdom in that place, as a grace from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. By God's life! They attained unto that which none in creation hath attained, as testified by that which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Book. Blessed is he whom God hath made steadfast in this Cause in such wise that neither armies terrified him nor factions hindered him.\n\nYe are the letters of the Book of God's love. At all times ye must, with the utmost spirit and joy, summon the heedless through wisdom and utterance, that perchance they may not be deprived of the Living Waters and may attain unto that which God hath willed. The petitions from the friends of that land, equal in number to 'Love', have been presented at the Most Holy Court, and likewise the names of a number have been mentioned and witnessed, and all have been blessed with divine favors, and all those souls have been adorned with the mention of their names in the Book of Names by the Most Exalted Pen. Know ye the value of this bounty and supplicate the Lord in the nights and days that He may assist you to preserve your exalted station. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. How often it happens that a soul is kept back by the croaking of a crow, and every falsehood that caused the misguidance of the servants on earth appeared in the garment of truth. He verily expoundeth unto you that which shall guard you from idle fancies and vain imaginings and draw you nigh unto God in all conditions. Two petitions from the Name of Glory have been presented before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. God willing, may he not be deprived of the ocean of divine favor in this luminous day and receive his portion from the outpourings of the clouds of abundant grace. Blessed is he who hath been granted leave, who hath drawn nigh, who hath attained, and who hath heard the Call of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Hold ye fast, with perfect certitude and assurance, to the cord of His favor and cleave ye to the hem of His bounty. Adorn yourselves with goodly character and, God willing, succeed in performing praiseworthy deeds. Whatsoever hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will hath been for the education, unity and love of the servants with one another. However, the deluded ones have made the religion of God, the Faith of God, and the Law of God the cause of conflict and contention. This is why in most Tablets this firm decree hath been sent down from the heaven of Will: \"Glory is not for him who loveth his country, but for him who loveth the world.\" Hold fast, O My loved ones, unto this utterance through which the kingdom of divine knowledge hath been adorned. Associate with all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship, and should wisdom dictate, convey the word of truth. Whoso accepteth it doth so for his own sake, and whoso turneth away - verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. In no wise is conflict and contention permissible. All have been created from one Word and unto that same Word do they return. For the Word there are stations and ranks that cannot be contained in pages and books. Hold fast unto the Book of God, then act according to what hath been revealed therein. It will protect you and draw you nigh unto Him. Beware lest anything prevent you from that which ye have been commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Conduct yourselves with the utmost wisdom, and whenever divine praise is raised, occupy yourselves with the mention of the martyrs who have laid down their lives in this straight Path out of love for the Beloved of the worlds, and likewise those souls who have ascended with perfect certitude - they are those through whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise seek blessing. To this beareth witness the Lord of all beings in this Luminous Tablet. Were ye to occupy yourselves with the praise and gratitude of God throughout all days, it would not equal a single letter of this Tablet, for therein the ocean of grace is surging, the sun of mercy is shining from its horizon, and the heaven of favor is seen to be upraised. Blessed is he who hath seen with his eyes, who hath heard with his ears, and who hath recognized with understanding the appearance of God, His sovereignty, His power and His might.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of those handmaidens who have turned to Thee, and hearkened, and responded when Thy shrill voice was raised betwixt earth and heaven. Then gladden them with the tidings of God's loving-kindness and His mercy that hath preceded all created things. How many men and women who, night and day, were occupied with the remembrance of God and awaited the days of His appearance, yet when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grandeur, all turned aside save whom God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willed. O handmaidens of God! Render thanks and be engaged in His praise and glorification, inasmuch as He hath assisted you to attain a station whereof the men of earth, be they divines or others, remain deprived and debarred. God willing, may ye all, with utmost sanctity and detachment, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God. This Day is truly mighty; one must arise to that which befitteth this Day. Should anyone ponder upon this Tablet, which is in truth the source of all heavenly Books, he would know of a certainty that whatsoever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen was and is intended for the protection of His servants and the education of mankind. And God speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way. The Command is God's, the One, the Mighty, the Beauteous.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Thou through Whose name the seas surged and the winds blew and the lamp was illumined! I beseech Thee by the pebbles of Thy lands and the stones of Thy city and the sands which have been blessed by Thy power and over which the breezes of Thy Cause have wafted, to ordain for Thy chosen ones, who have cast away all else save Thee and have taken hold of that which Thou didst command them in Thy Book, that which beseemeth the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace. O Lord! Thou beholdest the tyranny of Thine enemies and the tribulations of Thy loved ones. Thy Most Exalted Pen hath testified that they have borne for love of Thee what none before them hath borne, and there hath befallen them in Thy path that which hath caused all things to lament and raised the cry of weeping from the Concourse on High. I beseech Thee, O Fashioner of the heavens and Lord of Names, by Thy Name through which the world was manifested, to aid everyone who hath clung to the Most Great Name to that which beseemeth Thee and Thy days. Then make him steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the ascendancy of the factions nor the hosts of those who have turned away from Thee, O Lord of the beginning and the end, shall keep him back. Verily Thou art He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of creation. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.\n\nO My servants! Through the might of God and His power, and from the treasury of His knowledge and wisdom, I have brought forth and revealed unto you the pearls that lay concealed in the depths of His everlasting ocean. I have summoned the Maids of Heaven to emerge, adorned with the ornament of Mine own names, from behind the veil of concealment, and have clothed them with these verses even as My providence hath clothed the heavens with stars. Thus have the fountains of divine bounty flowed forth from this most great Prison, that all creation may be revived and renewed by the gentle breezes of His loving-kindness and the sweet fragrance of His tender mercies \\[...\\]\n\n=== END BH00709 ===\n\n=== START BH00710 ===\n\nHe is the Manifest above all who manifest!\n\nThis is a Book from God unto him who hath believed in the Spirit in His days, and who hath been seized by the fragrances of the days from his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and was of the believers.

Know thou that We created the Sidrat'ul-Muntaha in the crimson hill beyond the crimson sea of grandeur, and raised it to such a station that were all who are in the heavens and on earth to seek shelter beneath one of its leaves, they would be preserved from the heat of self and passion, inasmuch as We shed upon it a light from the lights of this Sun which hath dawned in truth - thus hath the matter been decreed, if thou be of them that know.\n\nWhen We desired that creatures should dwell beneath its shade, We heard its cry and its trembling within itself, such that the foundations of all things were shaken and the pillars of existence were well-nigh overturned, and it was about to be uprooted, whereupon the hand of thy Lord's power, the Most High, the Most Great, held it firm. When asked about its cry, it called out saying: \"O my Lord! I know that the King of Thy Will desireth that these servants should abide beneath my shade. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Will from which none in the heavens and earth can escape, that Thou shelter not beneath my shade any of those servants whose faces have been changed by the dust of idle fancies and vain imaginings, who have disbelieved in Thy Self, turned away from Thy Beauty, and taken for themselves a partner with Thee in sovereignty, after they were all created by Thy Word in Thy previous Manifestation Who appeared in truth and Whom Thou didst make a lamp unto the worlds. And if Thou desirest this, then create a pure, luminous, holy people, sanctified above all in the heavens and earth, whose eyes have fallen upon none but Thee, whose ears have heard naught but Thy melodies, whose tongues have moved only in Thy remembrance, whose hearts beat only with Thy love, and who regard all that is created on earth as utter nothingness, or as light as scattered ashes.\"\n\nWhen its cry was raised, We called unto it from the right side of the Throne: \"Be thou firm in thy place. By My life! Soon shall God create beings from holy dust and sanctify them from all that was and shall be, and make them proofs of His Essence, manifestations of His Self, dawning-places of His Names, rising-points of His Glory, treasuries of the pearls of His knowledge, and fountainheads of the revelations of His Cause which hath appeared in truth from the horizon of the heaven of sublime glory. And He shall ordain for them the laws of Paradise in love of this Youth, around Whom circle the spirits of the holy ones and those brought nigh. Thus have We ordained for thee from among these, that they may dwell beneath thy shade, be sustained by thy fruits, hearken unto thy melodies, and circle round thee morning and evening. Thus have We drawn aside the veils from the face of mysteries that thou mayest be apprised thereof and be of them that know.\n\nAnd if thou desirest to soar in the atmosphere of thy Lord's nearness and become aware of that which hath been veiled from the eyes of His servants, say 'In the Name of God', then soar in the atmosphere of attraction and detachment until thou reachest the garden of the chosen ones.

Then observe its streams and ponder its mysteries. Then hearken to the rustling of its trees, the cooing of its dove, the melody of its nightingale, and the murmuring of its waters. And when you discover it and what has been treasured therein of the pearls of your Lord's knowledge, the Most High, the All-Knowing, say: \"In the name of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\" Then ascend from that station, with the aid of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, until you reach the station of Lordship. Then will you discover the realities of all things as they are, and the breaths of the All-Merciful will take you, and attract you in such wise that you will witness nothing except that you behold inscribed by the Pen of Destiny upon its white countenance: \"He is God, there is no God but Him, and he whom He hath sent with the truth is indeed His Manifestation, His sovereignty, His might and His grandeur unto all the worlds.\" O thou who speakest towards the holy court! By God, the True One, today is the day of soaring; tarry not in any place, but ascend on the wings of the All-Merciful that thou mayest reach the pinnacle of Paradise. Then wilt thou find the Sun of thy Lord's mention, the Most Glorious, the Most Luminous, dawning from the horizon of grandeur. Thus doth the Youth counsel thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from the manifestations of Satan, and He findeth no helper nor supporter. We desired to mention unto thee what was ordained in the stations We have described to thee, but the Breath of God was restrained from His mouth by reason of what the hands of hatred from His wicked servants have wrought against Him. Thus hath it come to pass with Us, if thou be of them that hear. Forget not thy portion in these days, turn not unto the people, but set thy face at all times toward thy Lord and be steadfast with wondrous steadfastness. Then know that when We desired to mention a single letter of the hidden, treasured, and guarded mysteries in the repositories of thy Lord's protection, all who are in the heavens and earth were struck with terror, and all who are in the kingdom of command and creation fell unconscious. This is what We had foretold them through the tongue of Muhammad aforetime: \"Then the trumpet will be blown a second time, and lo! they will be standing, looking on.\" Thus was it decreed before in the preserved tablets of might. And the servants who claim to believe in God, the Mighty, the Most High, the Great, have committed what neither Nimrod, nor Pharaoh, nor the First and Second committed, for they did not openly war with God, nor did they calumniate Him, and though they were oppressors, they did not seek to cause confusion among God's assured servants. Say: By God! He who hath not purified his heart from all else save Him and hath not passed through the kingdom of names, will never be able to enter this station, whose very dust is blessed by the people of the Supreme Concourse and the spirits of the highest Paradise. Say: O people! I am but God's Youth among you. I have denied none among you, nor have I disputed with anyone. I have supported my Lord's Cause until His Word was raised to such heights that the hands of the polytheists were cut off from it. But when God's Word was exalted and His Cause shone forth and His sovereignty was manifested, then arose to slay me those servants who were created by My word, who denied God's right and His signs, and who disputed with My own Self. Therefore there hath descended regarding them from the heaven of command that which hath descended. By God! This is not from Me, but from One Mighty, Powerful. Say: Would that ye had known those whom ye have taken \\[...\\]\n\nTake not unto yourselves lords besides God if ye be of them that comprehend. Keep thyself apart from those who have disbelieved, and sanctify thy heart from the allusions of the people, that upon it may be imprinted the lights of thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the Mighty, the Luminous. O servant! Wilt thou remain silent after thy Lord, the Most High, crieth out between earth and heaven concerning that which hath befallen His Beloved at the hands of the oppressors among His creatures in this remote prison? Remember thy Lord, then proclaim His Cause, and fear no one, for verily He will protect thee with the hosts of revelation and inspiration, and He is the best of helpers and supporters. Thus have We revealed unto thee and commanded thee. Act thou according to what thou art bidden, and be of them that act. The Spirit and Glory and Might and Praise be upon thee and upon them who have ascended unto the heights of eternity in this Most Wondrous, Most Beautiful and Most Sweet Remembrance, and who were steadfast. And in conclusion, We counsel thee that when thou discoverest what hath been treasured within the words of thy Lord of the pearls of His knowledge, conceal them from the eyes of the heedless, for thereby will arise the clamor of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and the uproar of those in whose breasts lurks hatred for the Beauty of the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great.\n\n=== END BH00710 ===\n\n=== START BH00711 ===\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Glorious!\n\nThis is a Book from the Presence of Baha unto him who hath believed in God on a Day whereon all foundations were shaken with the fear of His Cause, and the dwellers of the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save those who held fast to the cord of God, turned away from all that is in the hands of men, recognized God with their own eyes, and detached themselves from all the worlds. O thou manifestation of bounty! How can I recount unto thee what hath befallen Me at the hands of him whom We created by Our command and whose name We exalted among Our remembering servants? When he witnessed the loftiness of the Cause and the exaltation of His name amongst the people, he desired to slay Me. When the hidden secrets of his heart were revealed, he raised an outcry within himself that he might cast the rancor of God into the hearts of the rebellious ones. Thou knowest well that had I desired to harm My brother, he would not have existed upon the earth. By God! Despite My knowledge of him and My awareness of what lay within his breast, We protected him through the sovereignty of might and power from the harm of the idolaters.\n\nO thou manifestation of bounty! Thou hast seen Me and associated with Me and witnessed the mountain of My tranquility and the ocean of My patience. Ponder within thyself what hath caused Me to raise My call between the heavens and the earth. By My life! If thou wouldst reflect upon this, thou wouldst attain unto a station of security and flee from these deniers. Beware lest the beauty of the Cause be veiled from thee by the veils of fancy and desire. Emerge from behind them through the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Hast thou not heard that every light is darkened before His splendor? By God, the Truth! This is His splendor upon all who are in the heavens and earth, and everything speaketh that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Encompassing.\n\nWhoso is not guided by God's guidance in these days hath indeed wronged himself and is regarded as one in darkness by thy Lord. Thus have We sent down the Command in all the Tablets, and thou art among those who bear witness. Say: Do ye deny Him for Whose meeting the Primal Point longed in His first manifestation, Who moved by His name and spoke in praise of His Own impregnable, exalted Self? Say: O people! If there should come unto you today anyone from among the Jews and Christians with a Tablet of God and His signs, and call out to you, \"O people! By what proof did ye believe in the Primal Point, and by what evidence do ye deny Him in His latter manifestation?\" - what would ye say, O heedless ones? By God! They would find no escape save by using the same proofs used by the people of the Furqan when the clouds of idle fancies were rent asunder and the Beauty of 'Ali came with the truth, and the matter was decided by God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nObserve the idolaters and what issueth from their mouths. They say, \"He hath appeared too soon.\" By God! What issueth from their mouths doth curse them, though they perceive it not and are among the heedless ones. Say: Is God powerful in His Cause, or are ye, O band of weaklings? If ye be powerful, bring forth your proof, O company of the veiled ones! And if ye acknowledge that He is indeed powerful over whatsoever He willeth, He hath manifested the Manifestation of His Self as He hath wished and willed, and hath raised Him up with truth and sent Him unto all the worlds.\n\nO people! Fear God and look not unto what ye possess. By God, the Truth! Nothing shall suffice you today, even if ye should cling to the books of the ancients and the scriptures of the latter ones. Fear God, then look upon Him with His eyes, not with the eyes of any created thing. Thus hath God counseled you in His holy, luminous Tablets. Then consider that by which your faith hath been established in every age and dispensation, and oppose not Him before Whose face the denizens of the highest Paradise have fallen prostrate in adoration - the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nThen the tongue of the Most High proclaims between the heavens and the earth, saying: \"O people! By God, the Truth, this is indeed the Beloved of the worlds and the Desire of them that recognize Him. And thou, O Manifestation of Bounty, hear My words, then pass along the path by thy Lord's power, then call out amongst the people with the most exalted voice and be not of them that remain silent. Say: O people! By God, the Truth, there hath shone forth from the horizon of the Brow a Sun whereon hath been inscribed by the pen of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted: 'The Kingdom on that Day shall be God's, the One, the Single, the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious.' And this Word is a sword which, were it to strike upon the back of Satan, would cause him to flee with his hosts to the nethermost fire. Thus hath the decree shone forth from the Dayspring of Glory, if ye be of them that perceive. Say: O people! The heaven of knowledge hath been cleft asunder and the Lord of Words hath come upon the clouds of inner meanings. Thereupon the words of them that possess subtle allusions were struck dumb. Thus hath the matter been decreed, if ye be of them that know. And if thou wert to recite this Tablet with the melody wherewith its verses were revealed in truth, it would attract the hearts of them that know. Would that thou wouldst turn unto the words of him who warred against God and ponder that which floweth from his pen. But after the Ancient Beauty avoided meeting with him, perchance thou mayest discover the truth of his affair and be of them that know. Then know thou that We have aforetime revealed unto thee a Tablet and sent it by the hand of one of them that seek. And We beseech God to grant thee what hath been ordained therein of the fruits of this Paradise. Verily He is the Provider, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.\"\n\nBy My life! If thou wert to reflect upon what the idolators have attributed to My Person, thou wouldst surely become acquainted with them and what lieth within their souls, for thou hast associated with Me and witnessed somewhat of My disposition amongst the peoples. By God! Where is the one possessed of sight, of hearing, and of heart who may comprehend this Cause and what hath befallen Me and been visited upon this Wronged Soul at the hands of these oppressors? I swear by the True One, O Javad! The Maids of Glory and Holiness have gathered in the chambers of these words, their faces grown pale with sorrow for this Youth, calling out to all creation with mournful voices, saying: \"O people! This is God's trust among you and His deposit within you. He is, in truth, the Beauty of 'Ali and the Essence of Muhammad. Through His Name the seas have surged with waves, the trees have yielded fruit, the clouds have poured forth rain, and the Ancient Essence hath been revealed with power. Beware, O ye who are endued with insight, lest ye perpetrate that which causeth tears to flow from the Eye of God, the Omnipotent, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise. Beware lest ye fail to believe in Him Who hath appeared with the proof of 'Ali, then with the evidence of Muhammad, then with the testimony of the Spirit, then with the signs of Moses. Slay Him not with the swords of rejection and hatred. By God! Through what ye have done, the hearts of the pure ones have been consumed, and the Spirit of Truth now lamenteth in the dust. O people! The denizens of the highest Paradise are bewildered by your deeds. Ye seek proofs from that which hath appeared from Him, yet ye would slay His all-compelling, transcendent, peerless Self.\" O Maids of the chambers! Be silent within yourselves, for your sweet melodies, though they may not affect hearts that have grown hard to the remembrance of God, have yet caused the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers to burn. Veil your faces lest they be profaned by those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God, and lest the gaze of the malevolent fall upon your countenances. Remain patient in your dwellings, for the Ancient Beauty hath endured in His own Self for twenty years, wherein His daily sustenance was but morsels of His liver and His drink but drops of His blood. Thus did the days decree unto Him while He remained tranquil within His Self - the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Put your trust in God and commit the Beloved's affairs unto Him. Let not yourselves be troubled, lest the clamor of all created things rise up to the precincts of manifest glory. Thus doth He command you, He by Whose command every commanded one is commanded, by Whose sovereignty every envoy is raised up, and from Whose presence every empowered and trustworthy Messenger is sent forth. I swear by God, O Manifestation of Bounty! The realities of all created things have been stirred by their melodies, and tears have flowed from the eyes of those near unto God by reason of their grief. Yet those who have disbelieved remain wrapped in thick veils. Would that one possessed of the sense of smell might detect the fragrance of holiness from the garment of God! Nay, by My life! None shall perceive it save those who are purified among the people of truth and certitude. Thus have We imparted unto thee the Word of Truth, that the breezes of truthfulness might draw thee to the station of steadfastness and justice, and sever thee from every lying doubter. And glory be upon thee and upon him who was named after the First Pillar of My Name, and upon those who, when they heard the Call of God, responded with manifest sincerity.\n\n=== END BH00711 ===\n\n=== START BH00712 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who domineth the earth and heaven!\n\nFrom the right hand is raised the Call of God, and from the left is manifest the Name of God, and before the face appear the signs of God, and above the head existeth the Word of God. Blessed is the soul that, through the attraction of the Divine Word and the key of heavenly bounty, hath opened the door of detachment. He is the educator of the servants and the servant of the Cause of the Lord of creation.\n\nO 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and My bounty. In this Most Great Revelation there hath been sent down that which was not revealed from the beginning of creation until now, and there hath appeared that which hath been sanctified from similarity and likeness. Observe how the attraction of the Supreme Word hath influenced the world of creation. Reflect upon its traces and fruits. The tribes of lovers were attracted by the mention of the Luminary of the horizons and were sent to the place of sacrifice. And He illumined the peoples of the cities of longing with the light of His manifestation in such wise that the gems of existence held neither station nor rank in their eyes. Detached from all else, they set their faces toward the court of the Most Glorious.\n\nThe power of the world produced no weakness, and the might of nations became no barrier. Exalted, exalted be His all-encompassing power and His prevailing Will! The harm inflicted upon this Wronged One hath outwardly exceeded human capacity; nevertheless, it did not prevent God from His purpose nor hinder the exaltation of His Word. Your honor is aware of the calumnies of the calumniators, the oppression of the oppressors, and the lies of the barking ones. Yet before the manifestation of God's Cause, all these were seen as non-existent, nay, utterly lost.\n\nRegarding what thou didst mention about Ibn-i-Rajab'Ali and his calumnies - that party hath not spoken, nor will they speak, the truth. They attribute to Yahya the treatise of the exalted Khal (the Bab's maternal uncle) which was outwardly called \"Iqan\" out of wisdom. By God's life! He is incapable of understanding it. Such deeds appeared from that source of tyranny as had no parallel in the world. The fire of his self consumed and destroyed the veil of the Most Great Infallibility. Despite there being several women in his household, most of whom are known by name and reputation, yet he did not spare the honor of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. That shameless one committed that which caused the Ancient Beauty to be afflicted with great sorrow for a time. This incident occurred during the days of exile of the Truth, exalted be His glory. Similarly, for the sake of two days of worldly life, he caused the martyrdom of Dayyan and Khalilu'r-Rahman, sending a woman to the government house for begging. He ordered the execution of the honored Mirza 'Ali-Akbar, who was reportedly one of the relatives of the Exalted One (the Bab), and had him martyred. He caused the unfortunate Abu'l-Qasim, who had been with him for several years, to be lost through great injustice, for it is known that in the absence of the Ancient Beauty, he had sought the daughter of the honored Aqa Muhammad-Karim, sending one note with a bottle of perfume, a handkerchief, and a knife. Her parents rejected this, and afterward gave her to Abu'l-Qasim. This became the cause of enmity and the manifestation of the fire of hatred. God protect us and you! All the companions who were in that land are aware of this incident \\[...\\]\n\nAmong the events that occurred was that Mulla Rajab-'Ali himself came from Karbila to Baghdad for two months to complain about Siyyid Muhammad. His son knows what transpired between them. After he voiced his complaints, We said: \"O Rajab-'Ali, abhorrent deeds have been heard of from that land. It is said they have resorted to theft, even biting off pieces of the holy shrine with their teeth, and likewise they have stolen the possessions of pilgrims to the illumined shrines.\" He swore that these acts were from Siyyid Muhammad, who had gathered a group engaged in such deeds, and there existed utmost enmity between him and Siyyid Kamal. The friends in the land of Kaf are aware; if one were to inquire of those three souls, perhaps he would confess. In any case, Mulla Rajab-'Ali said: \"I told the Siyyid these actions are not good.\" In response he said: \"You are unaware of the matter.\" In brief, after this Wronged One's return to Iraq, a sorrow descended that had no equal, until finally through sufficient healing words and loving counsels these impure deeds and their stench were eliminated. The Cause of God was so exalted that the people of Iraq of every kind attained the Most Holy Court, and on the day of the move from the house to the garden, the learned of that land, such as the late Alusi and others, came forward and cried out, and the people of Iraq from the Governor to military chiefs, judge and others were present in the Imam's garden. Surely you have heard of the gathering of the servants on that day and the love of the people. O 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! Later they did not observe the sanctity of Muharram, considering the rising of the Imams from their graves. This grievous error caused the people to withdraw and keep their distance. Glory be to God! We came from Iran to Iraq by the command and permission of the sovereign, and after some time Yahya arrived, and later the command to proceed to the great city appeared, and this Wronged One, in response to the plea of ministers and princes, departed. Each day he would make some demand, and then it was decided that he should proceed to Iran with the trust of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. After the move, he went towards the Threshold. When We arrived in Mosul, it was observed that he had stayed in that land waiting for Our arrival, though inwardly he denied the presence and approach of all, and his foolish followers accepted this. In brief, wherever We turned, he followed from behind. Seventy people in that journey saw and heard his deeds, actions and words. Nevertheless, the utmost kindness was shown to him, for had he been disappointed in this matter, he would never have turned in the direction this Wronged One turned. Every fair-minded and perceptive person bears witness to this. One must reflect upon the outward deeds to become aware of the degrees of opposition. In brief, there are many matters. We conclude them with the remembrance of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! God willing, through the favors of the Lord of Destiny thou shalt attain to that which hath no likeness or equal. We testify that thou didst turn unto Us when most of the servants turned away, and thou didst arise to serve the Cause when the people were wrapped in heedlessness and error. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Beware lest the clamor of men debar you from the Creator of heaven. Associate with the people of the earth with pure hearts and radiant breasts, and seek from God for all that which is the cause of eternal salvation and everlasting remembrance. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd concerning what thou hast written about Hadi-i-Dawlat-Abadi having in these days resorted to the recitation of elegies - God knoweth that that oppressor hath appeared with such deceit and craftiness as hath had no equal. He hath denounced certain ones to the oppressors. When that transient shadow failed to achieve his rejected purpose, he raised the standard of sedition and hanged the wronged Siyyid, and committed that which caused the Holy Spirit to lament. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid all to do that which beseemeth His days. Verily He is the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Wise. And may He cause to appear before the faces of His loved ones that which shall adorn them with the ornament of joy and gladness. Verily He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nThe splendor that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon thy wife and upon those who are with thee and who love thee and hearken unto thy words for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00712 ===\n\n=== START BH00713 ===\n\nO Ali before Akbar! At the time when you were present before the Throne in the Most Luminous Presence, the Kingdom of Divine Utterance commanded you with wisdom - you must be mindful of this in all conditions. Whosoever acts in accordance with that which has been manifested from the Source of Divine Will shall, without causing sedition and tumult, attain to that which He has ordained. Wisdom is a magnet that draws every distant one to the court of nearness and attracts every stranger to his homeland. Those souls who are attached to the ornaments of the world and are deluded by its transient positions will not awaken and arise from the slumber of heedlessness except through means which God alone knows. The wisdom mentioned in the Books and Tablets has been and continues to be the foundation of this edifice. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Were the hand of power to lift the veil from this station and that which is with God become manifest, all would testify that whatsoever has flowed from the Supreme Pen is indeed that which is beloved and conducive to the attainment of the Desired One. Thy letter was read before the Countenance, and We have answered thee with these words through which the sun of thy Lord's knowledge has shone forth. Blessed are they who know, and none attain unto this save the sincere ones.\n\nI testify before God, His angels, His Prophets, His chosen ones, His friends, His loved ones, and His faithful ones that the revelation of verses from God, the Lord of Names and Attributes, has reached such a degree that the sincere ones are unable to enumerate them and the scribes to record them. Indeed, they descend in the morning and evening, in the watches of the night and throughout the day. Given my inability and the inability of all others to record them, how can I occupy myself with anything else or burden the loved ones of God with my words which neither profit nor bear fruit? By the life of God! My heart has longed to make mention of the loved ones of God, but I find no opportunity to remember them in a manner befitting myself. Therefore, I seek their forgiveness in all circumstances, that God may forgive them as a favor from Him. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nAt all times, heart, tongue and pen yearn to make mention of the friends and masters, but this evanescent servant is so occupied that he finds no opportunity to hear mention or write a word. Therefore, if there be delay or lapse in reply, forgiveness is hoped for. Your letters arrived one after another, and as they were adorned with mention of the Lord of Names, they brought the utmost joy and delight. However, deep sorrow was felt regarding the tribulations that have befallen you. Though in truth, when one considers that whatever occurs for the sake of God, in the Cause of God, in the path of God, and for the good pleasure of God is and shall ever be an enduring blessing - for no deed is without recompense or requital, and the rewards for goodly deeds are recorded in God's Book and shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endures. Therefore, you should not be saddened by these tribulations. Your petitions were presented in the Most Holy Court, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth \\[...\\]\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about teaching the Cause, we beseech God to confirm you in this mighty matter. O My beloved! The heart of this evanescent one is aflame like a blazing fire, for we observe that the Truth is manifest, the Kingdom of utterance is resplendent, and the Day of God is witnessed; yet souls who purely for the sake of God remind people and call them to the truth are as rare as the philosopher's stone. How many lands have remained without cultivation and tillage, how many lands were tilled and cultivated but remained without water, and how many lands whose harvest time has come but there was no harvester to harvest them! Yet through the wonders of divine favors and the manifestations of the compassion of the All-Merciful, there is hope that souls will appear with heavenly characteristics and engage in teaching the Cause of God and educating all who dwell on earth. That which causes and effects the attraction of hearts and purification of souls has been detachment from all save God. Blessed is the soul who becomes intoxicated with the choice wine of divine utterance and speaks the mention of the Friend in the assemblage of the world. This intoxication increases consciousness and brings existence into non-existence. There is no end to the explanation of this station. He, verily, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. In all circumstances, the friends of God and the drinkers of the spiritual wine must observe wisdom and hold fast to what God hath revealed in the Book. Convey My greetings to the friends and loved ones in the land of Ta, and likewise to those who have been imprisoned in the path of God. Blessed are they! The world has had and has no worth, and all deeds shall become non-existent and perish except the deeds of those souls who have arisen for the sake of God - the traces of such deeds shall never be erased from the book of creation. Hereafter they must observe the utmost vigilance lest anything contrary to wisdom should appear, for this matter has been revealed in most of the Tablets, and that which has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen has been and shall ever be productive and the source of fruits. God willing, be occupied at all times with serving the Cause and hold fast to that which the Intended One hath desired. The names of the friends of God that were mentioned in your letter were all presented before the Presence. Blessed are they that their names were mentioned in the Most Great Scene, then joy be unto them for they shall have a goodly return. God willing, may they remain steadfast in the Cause of God, for this matter is most mighty, not like some who are moved by every wind, follow every breeze, and are drawn to every call. Convey to all, on behalf of this evanescent servant, sublime greetings. We beseech God to adorn them with the garments of steadfastness and cause them to speak His praise among all creatures. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nConvey My greetings to the honored son of the servant, Aqa Muhammad-Taqi. God willing, may they ever be successful in transcribing the verses of God, for there is no deed more beloved than this. The specimens of writing which they had requested were presented to the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His most pure footsteps. He said: \"You yourself are witness and can testify that due to the abundance of divine Tablets to be transcribed, there is absolutely no time or opportunity available.\" And truly it is as He has stated, for even when He repairs to the outskirts of the city for recreation, the Tablets accompany Him and He remains occupied with them there also. Observe how continually petitions arrive from all cities, lands, and from the various regions of this land. The transcription of the Divine Revelation is specifically assigned to this servant, while the transcription of Tablets is entrusted to the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be sacrificed for the movement of His pen. In truth, it is through God's power that we manage to accomplish even this much, otherwise it would appear extremely difficult in outward terms. We beseech Him for assistance in all conditions, for verily He is the Gracious Helper.\n\nThis servant's complete submission is that your honor should be engaged, with the utmost effort and attention, in fostering love and unity among the souls. The discord that occurred in that land has truly been a cause of the wastage of God's Cause. The friends were saddened by it while the enemies were gladdened. This matter is most grievous in the sight of God. Under all conditions, all must hold fast to the cord of unity, in such wise that no one should detect the slightest trace of discord among the loved ones of God. Today, which is the Lord of Days and the King of all times and seasons, the radiance of the All-Merciful should be witnessed in the countenances of those who believe in God. In any case, this matter of discord caused universal grief and darkened the world. God willing, this fire of discord shall be extinguished by the heavenly stream of love and unity, so that all may attain to that which God has willed. The Glory be upon you.\n\n=== END BH00713 ===\n\n=== START BH00714 ===\n\nHe wins the glances of He who won the Most Exalted Station - His Honor Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be all nine \\[Splendors\\] of His Most Splendid Splendor.\n\nHe is God - exalted be His glory, majesty and power!\n\nPraise be to God, Creator of all things and Fashioner of the heavens! His are the most beautiful names and the most exalted attributes. I pray, glorify and send peace upon those who rejoiced at the Most Great Ocean when it surged in the world, and who answered the Lord of Names when His sweetest call was raised between earth and heaven. These are servants whom, were all the pens of creation to describe them with the most wondrous allusions and words at their disposal, the seeing one would find them all beneath their station. Such is the station of those who have attained unto Him, who have spoken His praise and who have arisen to serve Him - how much more exalted then is the station of He who created them with a word from Him! Exalted be His dominion, exalted be His remembrance, exalted be His praise! We beseech Him, exalted be He, to gather us with them and ordain for us what He has written for them. Verily, He is the Guardian of those who act.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance! The servant has attained unto your letter and heard the sound of the quills of your utterance which soared in the atmosphere of love for our Lord and your Lord, our Master and the Master of the worlds. After perusing it, I presented it before the Face and submitted what was therein. Then there appeared from the Kingdom of Utterance that which I am powerless to mention. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist me in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Generous Giver.\n\nAs for what you mentioned concerning the presence of the Afnan - upon them be all His Most Splendid Splendor - regarding their arrival in Zawra and their departure to the land of Taff and beyond it, the servant praises God for this and rejoices at their well-being and the receipt of their news. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect them and to ordain for them what will benefit them in this world and the next.\n\nAnd as for what you mentioned concerning His Honor the Prisoner - upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] - I have presented it before the Face. Then the tongue of the Beloved spoke: \"O Muhammad-i-Mustafa! The Wronged One remembers you in the prison of Akka and thanks God for what has befallen Him in His path, and praises Him should tribulation be renewed in His love and desire. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Responding One. His verses have attracted Me and the fire of His love has enkindled Me to such an extent that were anyone to turn toward it with the ear of nature, they would hear its sighing from all My limbs, and were they to regard it with the eye of the heart, they would see its flame in My veins and members. There bear witness to what My pen has uttered honored servants whom the veils of the world have not prevented from the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity. They have cast away what they possessed and taken what they were commanded by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have heard the call of the Prisoner and We command him from this exalted, beloved station to say in his turning to God, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Sovereign of the Realm of Might:\n\n\"O Lord of Names and Fashioner of Heaven! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst subdue all things and through which the Most Exalted Horizon appeared, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy love, firm in Thy Cause, and speaking in Thy remembrance. O my Lord! Thou seest my gaze turned toward the horizon of Thy favors and my hand raised toward the heaven of Thy gifts. I beseech Thee by the Most Exalted Word to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will solace mine eyes and gladden my heart. O Lord! Enable Thy servants to recognize what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book and to act according to what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Tablets. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the Most High, the Great. Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds and Lord of the heavens and earths!\"\n\nAs to what hath been mentioned concerning the letters Kha and Ta, We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him and enable him to remember and praise Him, and to make him steadfast in his love for His chosen ones and His friends. Within His grasp lieth the Kingdom of the heavens and earth, and in His right hand the dominion of command and creation. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Single One, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nAs to what was mentioned regarding Amin Bey, let him hold fast unto the cord of righteousness, placing his trust in God, and say: \"O my God and the God of all names! Ordain for me that which is best for me in the Kingdom of creation. Every atom testifieth to Thy knowledge and power, Thy grandeur and sovereignty, and Thou knowest what profiteth and preserveth me. Thou, verily, art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nO Muhammad! Counsel the loved ones of God with wisdom. We have previously counseled them not to believe every speaker, nor trust every claimant, nor reveal themselves before every deceitful traitor. Thou must urge them to safeguard that which must needs be safeguarded. Most people soar in the atmosphere of passion and follow every crier who hath turned away from God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. We counsel all with wisdom, trustworthiness and the fear of God, and with that whereby the station and dignity of man may be manifested in the contingent world. There is no God but Him, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWhen the letter reached this point, I was gladdened, nay awakened, by thy latter call in remembrance of God, the Lord of Destiny. When I was honored to read and learn of its contents, I ascended, attended, and presented before His Presence that which the Trusted One had presented and which Joseph had composed. Thereupon the Beloved spoke: \"We have made mention of the Trusted One and We beseech Him, exalted be He, to give him to drink from the Kawthar of divine knowledge by the hand of His bounty, and to acquaint him with that which every ignorant and remote one hath failed to comprehend. O Amin! Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of the robe of thy Lord's mercy, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Be thou thankful unto God in all conditions, then remember Him with goodly remembrance. Peace be upon thee and upon those who follow that which hath been ordained in a perspicuous Book. We have mentioned thee before, and this is yet another time, that thou mayest rejoice and be among those who are firmly established. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\"\n\nO Joseph! Bear thou witness unto that whereunto all things have testified: that there is none other God but Him. He maketh to live and causeth to die, then causeth to die and maketh to live. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not. Within His grasp lieth the Kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth, and in His right hand the sovereignty of Command and Creation. There is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe servant present hath appeared before the Wronged One and recited that which thou didst compose in praise of God and His loved ones. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which He hath ordained for His chosen ones, and to grant thee the good of this world and of the world to come. He, verily, is the Protector of them that remember Him.\n\nWe have restrained the Pen lest it range in the field of utterance and thereby raise the clamor of the people of the contingent world. To this testifieth every fair-minded and perceiving soul. We have summoned all unto God and made known unto them the straight Path. They have risen against Us with such tyranny as hath weakened Islam, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have driven Us from Our homeland to preserve their dominions, but when We departed there entered therein such as desired it through oppression, whereat the hearts of them that are nigh unto God have lamented. Say: Take ye heed, O people of the earth, then judge with fairness concerning the matter of this Wronged One Who hath informed you and brought you glad tidings through the grace of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nWe counsel thee to observe wisdom, lest the clamor of every heedless and remote soul be raised. O My loved ones! Speak ye according to capacity, for most of the people are wrapped in heedlessness and thick veils. O My loved ones! In all circumstances it behooveth you to hold fast unto wisdom. By Him Who hath caused all things to speak forth His praise! He who hath spoken the truth had no purpose save the exaltation of the Cause and religion of God, yet the heedless have imagined that he desired to spread corruption in the land. Thus have their souls seduced them. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Soon shall they bewail themselves and their dominions once again, even as they lamented after Our departure, unless they repent and return unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nI submit once again to your honor that your second letter hath brought me such joy as I am unable to mention or express to you. I beseech the Intended One, glorified be His majesty, to reward you with the most excellent reward and to assist you for your kindness to this servant who hath held fast to the cords of the loving-kindness of God's chosen ones - our Lord, your Lord, and the Lord of all worlds. Moreover, the Most Glorious Splendor and the Most Luminous Light be upon your honor and your household, and upon those who are there among the loved ones of God, the Peerless, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible.\n\nThe Servant\n\n15 Sha'ban 1297\n\nA packet has been sent to your presence addressed to his honor the Physician, bearing 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], that you may forward it to him in the city.

Through Him was the standard of Divine Unity raised aloft and the decree of detachment made firm. Upon Him be the blessings of God and His peace, and upon His family and companions through whom God established the pillars of His Cause and manifested His might and sovereignty. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nAnd now, the letter of that beloved of the heart and apple of the eye, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, which was sent in the name of the spiritual beloved, Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be God's everlasting peace, was forwarded to this servant and after being read was presented before His presence. O Abdullah! Praise be to God that thou art illumined by the light of recognition of God, exalted be His Glory, and art adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. Repeatedly hast thou been mentioned and been the recipient of His favors. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Aid the unitarians to celebrate Thy praise and glorification and to serve Thy Cause, that through them Thy signs may be spread among Thy creation and Thy praise among Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the nations and King of eternity, by the Most Great Name, to protect Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies and the unitarians from the oppression of the polytheists among Thy creatures. Then enable them to act in accordance with what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book whereby Thou hast distinguished between the obedient and the rebellious. O Lord! Strengthen the foundations of Thy servants for Thy service, then illumine them with the light of Thy knowledge. Verily Thou art the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nMake mention of the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God to aid all to wisdom and utterance, for wisdom is the cause of the protection of the servants and the preservation of lands. Today what is needed is unity and concord. We beseech God to aid and enable the various parties of the people of unity that all may become united. When the decree of unity is made manifest and the light of concord shineth forth, the primordial power shall appear and encompass all. To this testifieth every learned one, every fair-minded one, and every just and informed one.\n\nWe wish to make mention of thy son who is named Abdul-Mahdi in thy letter. Blessed is he in that he hath attained to the service of the Cause. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for him that which perisheth not and to protect him and draw him nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nIn these days mention hath repeatedly been made of that spiritual beloved and apple of the eye, Abdul-Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God, and the reply to each one hath been sent. This servant beseecheth his Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven, to aid His loved ones unto that which attracteth the hearts and souls. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nConcerning their mention of visiting Karbila and Najaf, and likewise meeting with the holy ones, upon them be God's peace, and mention of the heedless Dowlatabadi - that heedless one's deeds have been and remain evidence of his station, as do his words and actions. This latest deed of his is fully known and evident in the prison. That unjust one committed, for the sake of two days of life, that which darkened the world of justice and fairness. The deluded party has, from the beginning until now, been occupied with and uttered such deeds and words that their mention causes sorrow to the people of the cities of joy and delight. The earthworms dwell in clay and were not and are not capable of soaring in this refined atmosphere. In these days two matters have become manifest, that those possessed of insight might distinguish between the people of the Most Sublime Vision and others, and become aware. First is the deed of His Holiness Ashraf, may my spirit be sacrificed for him - his deed testifies to his detachment and bears witness to his love and yearning. Freely did he sacrifice his life in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. The other matter is the deed of the heedless Dowlatabadi, who through a thousand deceits, tricks and hypocrisies preserved his life. Were this servant to mention those whom wealth, glory, fortune and life did not prevent from sacrificing their spirits and lives in God's path, he would need to compose a book. But where are the eyes and where are the ears? Dowlatabadi was not with the Truth and had and has no knowledge of the Cause, yet he dismisses this vile deed, grievous wrong and great oppression before his followers with two words. That party walks exactly like the Shi'ih party and is caught in the same vain imaginings. Leave them in their idle sport. They cling to the name while deprived of the meaning. But that heedless one's deed has melted hearts and set aflame the city of steadfastness. It has indeed melted the heart and produced a mighty effect. The servant asks his Lord to aid him to be fair and to return. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nThey mentioned those two honored souls, upon them be God's peace and care. Two blessed Tablets were sent especially for them. It is hoped they will drink from the ocean of His words and adorn the world with the garment of awareness. However, a trustworthy, steadfast and reliable person must carry and deliver them, that they might find from them the fragrance of care and kindness.\n\nAnd they mentioned Husayn-i-Sukhti. Would that someone had told him: You were not in the Land of Ta, nor were you like Siyyid Muhammad after arriving in Iraq. He would come and go before Us. By the life of the Desired One, he was unaware of the root of the matter. Apart from these considerations, how did he know what transpired before the Primal Point and from whom it came? Say: If you find for yourself hearing, sight and heart, return to the sacred writings. They will guide you to a manifest light and mighty news. But he was not and is not capable of being guided. Hatred has overcome and erased the white point. However, our duty is prayer. Through God's grace and favor, all corruption, contention and conflict have been strictly forbidden. Therefore we must seek everyone's deliverance from the ocean of divine generosity and ask justice and fairness for each one. He is the Generous and He is the Bountiful.\n\nMention hath also been made of Sheikh Rajab and his son Mahmud, upon both of whom be God's peace. After being presented before Us, We said: \"O Rajab, upon thee be God's peace. Thy mention hath come before the Wronged One. We make mention of thee and beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee and thy son in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for you both, from the wonders of His bounty, the best of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones, and the Ultimate Goal of those who are nigh and sincere.\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones and counsel them to perform goodly deeds and display praiseworthy conduct, and to do that which distanceth man from ignorance and draweth him nigh unto knowledge, sanctifieth him from corruption and adorneth him with reformation. By God's life! We love to see each one of you sanctified from rancor and hatred, and adorned with love and fidelity. We beseech God to send down upon you, from the heaven of grace and bounty, a mercy from His presence and a blessing from His own Self. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThe friends have always been and continue to be remembered. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to cause His loved ones to attain unto that which is the source of the light of knowledge and wisdom, and likewise to grant them success in achieving fellowship and unity. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAs commanded, association with Husayn-i-Sukhtih is not permitted, for he is consumed with the fire of hatred and is deprived of justice and fairness, unless he should return. Leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nPeace, mercy and glory be upon you and upon God's righteous servants.\n\nThe Servant\n\n8 Ramadan 1306\n\n=== END BH00715 ===\n\n=== START BH00716 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nAll praise, sanctified above what is witnessed and seen, befitteth the Lord of earth and heaven, Who, through the mighty, conquering, powerful, and masterful hosts of the Supreme Pen and its treasuries, hath conquered the cities of hearts and minds of the people of understanding, and hath bestowed fresh life upon a dead world. Whensoever existence contemplates His generosity, His hosts, His grandeur, His sovereignty, and that which hath appeared from Him - His signs and His evidences - it findeth itself bewildered, wonderment upon wonderment. Without arrayed armies, visible means, or penetrating weapons, from the beginning of days until now, with a steadfastness that hath shaken the foundations of the world, He hath summoned all with the most exalted call unto that which God hath willed, until the light of His Cause hath shone forth and radiated from the horizon of every land according to its measure. Glorified be His greatness and exalted be His sovereignty! There is none other God but Him.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O God of all contingent beings and Educator of all created things! I beseech Thee by Thy power, at whose manifestation the might of the world and the strength of nations were enfeebled, to assist Thy loved ones to attain unto such steadfastness as shall cause the hearts of the world and the learned among the peoples to tremble. O my Lord! Thou seest how they have interposed themselves between Thee and Thy servants, and have prevented them from the river of Thy mercy and the ocean of nearness unto Thee. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy bounty, which the heedlessness, disobedience, rebellion and denial of Thy servants in all lands have not withheld, to assist Thy creation to turn unto Thee, to hold fast unto the cord of obedience unto Thee, and to cling to the hem of Thy mercy. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nFurthermore, O beloved of my heart, thy noble letters have arrived continuously and successively. Praise be to God, their characters gladden hearts and their words bring joy to souls. The letters of God's loved ones are, in truth, in the first degree, the supreme remedy for the world of existence, the manifestation of grace amongst the servants, and the banner of remembrance for all in the lands, for they were adorned with the sweet fragrances of the love of our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Each was presented and received its answer, but the greatest task, which is known and evident to that beloved one, has been the cause and reason for the delay in replies, and this matter is clear and evident to that beloved heart. At the time of presenting them, the radiance of the Sun of loving-kindness was manifested in such wise that this servant was truly incapable of describing it at that moment. May my spirit be a sacrifice for His loving-kindness, for His remembrance, for His tenderness! However, this servant had begun the reply to your honor some time ago, and I beseech God for assistance in sending it soon. And now, on the twenty-fifth of Rabi'u'l-Avval, your new noble letter dated the fifteenth of Safar has arrived. Praise be to God, it attracted the heart and brought joy to the spirit; from its delight a complete effect was manifest, and after reading and observing it, I approached the presence of the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, it was presented before His face and was honored to be heard. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nO Leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree! In the highest Paradise the Ultimate Tree hath spoken forth this most exalted Word: O peoples of the earth! The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which He hath. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of His Manifestation, His appearance and His sovereignty. Soon will His irrevocable Cause encompass all who are in the world, and the Herald will cry out from the right side: \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing!\" Blessed is the soul that hath attained and acted, and woe betide every heedless doubter.\n\nO Leaf! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have mentioned thee through that which causeth the light to shine forth, as a favor from Us unto thee, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto steadfastness and art occupied with His mention and praise. The ocean is manifest, the light is radiant, verses are being revealed, and evident signs are shining forth. The Speaker of the Mount is seated upon the throne of Manifestation, and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the scratching of the Pen are raised high, yet the people are in evident error.\n\nSay: O servants! Deprive not yourselves. Soon shall all cry out \"We turn unto Thee, O God of the worlds\" and \"We have returned to the court of Thy grace, O Beloved of them that know.\" Strive that perchance ye may receive your portion from the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen and take your share. At all times the pearls of wisdom and utterance are manifest therefrom. Beware lest ye make yourselves to be of the deprived ones.\n\nConvey My greetings to all the friends in that land. Verily We make mention of them through My loving-kindness, remind them of My verses, and give them glad tidings of My grace which hath encompassed all in the kingdom of earth and heaven. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy words concerning this irrevocable, this wise Cause and this Great Announcement.\n\nIn truth, one is bewildered as to how to render thanks and in what manner to fulfill this duty. Were all things, the particles of the world of creation, the drops of the seas, and the leaves of the trees to become tongues, they would fall short, and this servant, with utmost lowliness, hath offered and continueth to offer thanks before that Beloved One, and since permission hath been granted, it is surely adorned with acceptance and illumined with the light of grace.\n\nThe petition of Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah Khan, upon him be the glory of God, was presented at the Most Holy Court, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply - The Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Answerer\n\nO 'Abdu'llah! Give thanks unto the Object of all the world's adoration, Who hath made thee aware through the breezes of the dawn of His Revelation and guided thee. The whole world was created for the recognition of this Day and the service of His Cause, yet when the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen and the rustling of the Ultimate Tree were raised high, the entire party of the Shi'ih arose in opposition, save a few among the companions of Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i - upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all who are on earth and in heaven. Would that they had been content with mere opposition! They issued the verdict for the shedding of His most pure blood. When thou attainest unto the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: \\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me and strengthened me to recognize Thy Day which Thou hast adorned with Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. All glory be unto Thee for having made known to me Thy mighty Announcement and Thine ancient Cause, and for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance until I turned toward Thy most exalted horizon and Thy most glorious station. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of Creation, by the ocean of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy grace, to forgive me and my parents and those who have believed in Thee and Thy signs. O Lord! I am he who hath turned toward Thee and hath taken no lord except Thee. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the effulgent lights of the Sun of Thy wisdom to ordain for me that which shall profit me. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nO servant of God! The Truth hath appeared for the purpose of attaining His presence, but the idolaters stand as barriers and the deniers as obstacles. We beseech Him to record for thee the reward of attaining His presence and whatsoever beseemeth His might, His sovereignty and His power. Glory be upon thee.\n\nPraise be to God that his honor 'A' and 'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God, have attained unto the effulgent traces from the horizon of the Pen of the Beloved of the worlds. This servant also conveyeth his greetings to them and beseecheth confirmation from the Truth on their behalf. Verily our Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful, worthy to answer prayers. I end these words declaring that there is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. I convey greetings, praise and salutations to all the loved ones in that land, and I beseech for all that which is the cause of the reformation of the world and the education of the nations. It is hoped that in these days replies to the various letters will be sent. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken unto your words concerning the Cause of our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Lord of the Exalted Seat.\n\n=== END BH00716 ===\n\n=== START BH00717 ===\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving! He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Ever-Relenting!\n\nGlorified be He Who doeth whatsoever He willeth! Verily He is the Commander of earth and heaven. Neither the hosts of names nor all that exists in the realm of creation can withhold Him. He is, in truth, the Just Ruler, the Trustworthy.\n\nO thou who art immersed in the ocean of transgression! By My life, what hath been attributed to thee and what hath become known of thy deeds hath grieved Me. By God! Such sorrow hath seized Me that the Pen hath been prevented from the remembrance of God, the Lord of all nations. We have heard its lamentation and its cry concerning that which hath befallen its Beloved in days wherein every mouth should smile, every sorrowful one rejoice, every hesitant one hasten forward, and every seated one soar on the wings of longing. Yet there hath appeared that which hath caused the liver of righteousness to melt and justice to wail before God, the Lord of all mankind, by reason of what hath befallen the Wronged One on a day wherein the fire of passion was kindled amongst men.\n\nGrief hath overtaken Me on account of that which hath seized the crown of thy head and the adornment of thy temple. The hand of destiny hath stripped thee and rendered thee deprived of the outpourings of thy Lord's days, the Lord of all names. It behooveth thee to weep, and I weep for what hath befallen Me and thee through thy evil deeds. By God! Deeds have wailed because of thy actions, and the Book of Forgiveness because of thy disobedience, and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God have been consumed by the desires of thy self.\n\nThou wert created to aid My Cause, yet thou didst support Mine enemies through deeds more powerful than the hosts of kings and sovereigns, and thou didst abandon Me to the tongues of Mine enemies which were sharper than swords and more penetrating than the venom of serpents. Thus doth the Lord of Religions lament upon the dust before all faces.\n\nI know not by what word to speak nor by what mention to recall that which hath befallen Me at the hands of those who claim to love Me. Shall I say what Jacob said - I complain of my distress and grief unto God? Nay, by My soul! I desire not to complain of tribulation, suffering and ordeal. Rather, I give thanks unto God in His decree and destiny, and I shall exercise beautiful patience. He is the Help in time of need against what they describe.\n\nCan anyone stand against His decree and destiny? Nay, by His own Self, the Truth! Verily He is the Self-Subsisting in His Cause, the Executor of His judgment, the Supreme Ruler by His sovereignty. He is the Praiseworthy in His deeds, the Obeyed One in His judgment, and He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.\n\nBy My life! My condition and circumstances have transcended mention and utterance. While I was sitting upon the ashes, crying and weeping for Myself and for what had befallen Me from the loved ones, at that moment a letter arrived and was presented by the servant who was present before Me. We heard a plaintive cry whereat the Maid of Heaven lamented and a shriek whereat the fruits cried out, and therein he said \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! My deplorable state has reached such a pass that all remembrance is cut off, and my rebellion has attained such a degree that neither turning to Thee, nor remembrance, nor return, nor seeking forgiveness can profit me. I have violated Thy sanctity after Thou didst enjoin me to preserve it amongst Thy loved ones. By Thy glory! My transgression has become as fire consuming my deeds and devotions. Is there for me, O my God, any station of return whereat I might turn in repentance unto Thee? I testify that through my rebellion the rain of mercy has been withheld from the clouds of Thy bounty, and the manifestations of the lights of grace from the Daystar of Thy forgiveness. O Lord! The ocean of rebellion advances toward Thee, and the mountain of error turns to the court of Thy generosity. Thou seest me, O my God, immersed in the sea of disobedience and consumed by what hath befallen Thee through my evil deeds, O Ocean of forgiveness! By Thy might and Thy majesty! I am ashamed to seek pardon from Thee or ask Thee for forgiveness, for through my deeds the fire of despair and deprivation was ignited, and I was not inclined to return, O Lord of forgiveness and beneficence. In such state there occurred to my mind a remembrance from among the remembrances which flowed from the Pen of Thy Command in the Book of the Righteous. Though my deeds have made me despair of Thy tenderness and mercy and forgiveness and bounty, and deprived me of Thy grace and generosity and benevolence and favors, yet I cannot say that my rebellion has overwhelmed the ocean of Thy forgiveness, or that through my error the traces of Thy favor have been erased and the waves of the ocean of Thy pardon have been stilled. Since this is so, then Thou seest me, O my Beloved and my Purpose, bereft of every rank and good deed and kindness and virtue, clinging to the cord of Thy generosity to which all beings have testified, and to Thy grace to which all things have borne witness. Deal with this abject one who hath acknowledged Thy glory and power, this poor one who hath confessed Thy might and riches, this wearied one who hath testified to the kingdom of Thine utterance. Thereupon the tongue of my inner and outer being is silenced through my shame and rebellion and abandonment of what Thou didst command me. By Thy glory! I have cast aside my pleading and hope and deeds and will, looking to Thy grace and Thy will. Do with me as Thou pleasest. Verily Thou art the One praised in Thy deeds and obeyed in Thy command.\n\nAnd when another letter arrived from him and was opened, hearts and souls wailed from its lamentations, and from its despair the livers were burned and tears flowed. Then the gates of grace and bounty were opened, and the door of mercy and faithfulness. We said: Do not grieve, even though your error has stripped the temple of the Cause of its robe of glory and dignity. But thy Lord's mercy has preceded both the righteous and the wicked. Verily thy Lord forgave Adam with a word from His presence - the father of mankind acknowledged his error and was forgiven. The oceans of rebellion cannot stand against a drop from thy Lord's ocean of forgiveness. We have purified thee with the Kawthar of return and forgiven thee through Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving, and He is the Ever-Turning, the All-Compelling, the All-Choosing. However, from thy deed appeared that which had never occurred to anyone among those who circled round the Cause in this Most Great Prison. O Muhammad, rejoice! By God, God hath forgiven thee and purified thee by His binding command among the nations. Today thou art before God among those who have no sin. Whoso imagineth otherwise is among the worshippers of vain fancies in the sight of God, the Lord of all beings. Say: O people of Baha, fear God and be not among the heedless. How did ye precede with speech after We had described the people of Baha as those who precede Him not in speech and who act according to His command? And they spread indecency after We had forbidden them from it. Those who love that indecency should spread among the people of Baha have no share in God's grace and mercy, nor have they any station beneath the canopies of His grandeur. Behold, O people of the Bayan, what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an. I seek refuge with God, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing: \"Verily they who brought forth the lie are a band among you. Do not consider it an evil for you; nay, it is good for you. Every person among them shall have what he hath earned of sin, and he who took upon himself the chief part thereof shall have a grievous punishment. Why did not the believing men and believing women, when ye heard it, think good of themselves and say: 'This is a manifest lie?' Why did they not bring four witnesses thereof? Since they have not brought the witnesses, they are liars in God's sight. Were it not for God's grace and mercy upon you in this world and the next, a grievous chastisement had befallen you for that which ye spread abroad, when ye uttered with your tongues and spoke with your mouths what ye had no knowledge of, and counted it a light thing, while with God it was grave. And why, when ye heard it, did ye not say: 'It is not for us to speak of this. Glory be unto Thee! This is a mighty calumny.' God admonisheth you that ye never return to the like thereof, if ye be believers. And God maketh clear to you the signs, and God is Knowing, Wise. Verily those who love that indecency should spread among the believers - for them is a grievous chastisement in this world and the next. God knoweth, and ye know not. Were it not for God's grace upon you and His mercy, and that God is Kind, Merciful... O ye who believe! Follow not the steps of Satan, and whoso followeth the steps of Satan, verily he commandeth indecency and wrong. Were it not for God's grace upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure; but God purifieth whom He will. And God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\"\n\n=== END BH00717 ===\n\n=== START BH00718 ===\n\nFrom the right hand of the Throne hath been sent down:\n\nO Ali! From the day when the promised Tablet - which hath been designated as the Cry, the Hour, and the Trump - was dispatched, the idolaters and deniers have arisen with the utmost craftiness and scheming. Though outwardly nothing is apparent, yet thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. With the utmost determination they have been and are seeking the Ancient Beauty. In these days, each day witnesseth a new occurrence in this land. By the Truth! Never hath there been, nor shall there ever be, any grief from these matters and whatsoever hath occurred before or shall occur hereafter. The Ancient Beauty is established upon the Most Great Throne with such joy that were but a breath thereof to pass over the dwellers of earth, all would perish from delight, gladness and ecstasy. However, the grief is that the servants are weak, and the Truth, out of kindness and mercy, summoneth them from the ocean of tribulations and trials to the uttermost goal, yet these veiled souls perceive it not. O Ali! Exert the utmost endeavor and guard the edifice of the Cause from the thieves. Consider the physical house: if slumber overtaketh its guardians, assuredly the thieves will enter and intrude. However, if the guardians remain engaged in their watch and protection, the thieves shall never gain access. Now it behooveth the sincere ones among the loved ones of God to make every effort and protect God's Cause and His edifice from the thieves. Say: Stand guard at the gate, then drive away the evil ones with the shooting star of the remembrance of My Name, the Mighty, the Impregnable.\n\nAgain revealed to Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar.\n\nSome people have sought and continue to seek specific worldly ornaments from the Most Holy Court, and this is far removed from justice and fairness. From the beginning of the Revelation until now, never has there been any indication to anyone regarding such matters - sacred is the hem of the Cause from such mentions, let alone their actualization. It is incumbent upon all to counsel the servants and declare what comes from God. The Herald of Divine Unity calls out from the realm of Divinity: O loved ones! Soil not the sacred hem with the clay of this world, and speak not according to the dictates of self and passion. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause, which shines with perfect radiance and light from the heaven of the prison, that today those who have turned to the Qiblih of existence must be sanctified and detached from both the seen and unseen. Should they engage in teaching, they must do so with pure intention, complete detachment, independence, lofty resolve, and innate holiness, turning to all regions with the fragrances of the All-Merciful. It behooveth such souls to make their provision trust in God and their raiment the love of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, that their words may have effect. Those souls who today fix their gaze upon personal desires and the ornaments of this transient world are seen to be utterly remote. In most times, there have been no apparent ornaments in the court of the All-Merciful, and those circling round have been in great hardship. Nevertheless, never has any mention of the world, or word indicating it, shone forth from the Dayspring of the Supreme Pen. And if anyone was blessed to send a gift to the Most Holy Court, it was accepted out of grace, even though were We to desire to possess all the wealth of the earth, none would have cause to question. No deed is more abhorrent than begging among people in the name of Truth. It is incumbent upon that honored one and the companions of Truth to summon people to the greatest detachment and the most great sanctity, that the fragrance of the Most Glorious Robe might be inhaled from His loved ones. However, the wealthy must be mindful of the poor, for the station of the patient among the poor is great in the sight of God. By My life! No station equals it save what God willeth. Blessed is the poor one who is patient and discrete, and blessed is the rich one who spends and prefers others. God willing, the poor should strive and engage in earning a livelihood, and this is a matter prescribed for every soul in this Most Great Revelation and is reckoned among good deeds before God. Whoever acts upon this will surely receive divine assistance. Verily, He enriches whomsoever He willeth through His grace. He is, verily, powerful over all things.\n\nLikewise, from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful's Will have shone forth words concerning the protection of souls and the education of the people of the nation and country, the benefits of which will encompass all who are on earth, were they to hear what hath been sent down from the heaven of the Command. At present it is not expedient to send it; it remains suspended in the heaven of Will until such time as the Divine Will determines it be sent. The Command is in His hand. Strive diligently in the education of souls, for this has been and will continue to be among the most important matters. And glory be upon thee, O thou whose call We hear in remembrance of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nO Ali! Say to the loved ones of God that the first quality of human nature is fairness, and all matters depend upon it. Reflect a little upon the afflictions and tribulations of this Prisoner, Who has spent His entire life in the hands of His enemies, and every day has been afflicted with a fresh trial in the path of God's love, until the Cause of God was exalted amongst His servants. Now if anyone should arise and, following his own imaginings, engage either secretly or openly in causing division among the people - is such a one to be counted among the fair-minded? Nay, by His Self, the All-Compelling! By My life, My heart laments and Mine eyes weep for the Cause of God and for those who speak that which they understand not and imagine in their souls that which they perceive not.\n\nToday it behooveth all to hold fast to the Most Great Name. There is no refuge or haven save Him. Let them unite the people. Should one be established in the highest station, and should words proceed from him that would cause division among the people, he hath turned away from the shore of the Most Great Ocean and directed himself to that which is limited by human boundaries. All creation beareth witness that such a one is deprived of the breezes of the All-Merciful. Say: Be fair, O people of understanding! He that hath no fairness hath no human qualities.\n\nGod is aware of all souls and what they possess. The forbearance of God hath emboldened souls, for He does not rend asunder the veils before their appointed time, and due to the precedence of mercy, manifestations of wrath have been withheld. Therefore, most people imagine that God is unaware of what they commit in secret. Nay, by His all-knowing, all-informed Self! All is visible and evident in the mirror of His knowledge. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Concealer of the weaklings' faults! Praise be unto Thee, O Forgiver of the heedless ones' sins!\n\nWe forbade the people from following delusion that they might recognize the manifest Sovereign and that which proceedeth from Him. Yet now they are seen to be captive to their own doubts and imaginings. By My life, they themselves are delusion and perceive it not, and that which they utter is delusion and they understand it not. We beseech God to assist all and to make them know Him and their own selves. By My life, whoso attaineth unto His knowledge soareth in the atmosphere of His love and detacheth himself from all who dwell on earth, let alone those who speak according to their desires that which God hath not permitted them.\n\nSay: Today is the day of hearkening. Hear ye the voice of the Wronged One. Speak ye in the name of Truth, and be adorned with the ornament of His remembrance and illumined by the lights of His love. This is the key to hearts and the polish of existence. Whoso remaineth heedless of that which hath flowed from the Finger of God's Will is in manifest error. Rectitude and trustworthiness are essential to faith, not discord and corruption. Convey that which thou hast been commanded by the Trustworthy, the Faithful One. Verily, the glory be upon thee, O thou who remembereth My Name, who gazeth toward My direction, and who uttereth the praise of thy Lord, the Beautiful.\n\n=== END BH00718 ===\n\n=== START BH00719 ===\n\nThis is what hath been uttered by the tongue of the Beloved:\n\nO Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! Thy letter hath come before Our presence and We have heard what was therein. Through this the ocean of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been set in motion and casteth forth the pearls of divine knowledge. Be thou thankful and numbered with them that render thanks. We beseech God to adorn with thy remembrance the temple of existence and through thee to raise the standards of His Cause amidst the concourse of the seen and the unseen. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAs to what thou didst mention concerning Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan, convey unto him greetings from this lonely Prisoner. Say: Blessed art thou, O servant, for having migrated with the exiles of God, having accompanied them and joined with them in thy journey. Thy Lord, verily, is the Protector of all things. He knoweth what the hands of His loved ones have wrought and witnesseth what they do in His path. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Wise. Grieve not that thou wert prevented from attaining Our presence. We desire him who hath desired Us, yet the heedless have intervened between us. We have written for thee the reward of one who hath attained Our presence and appeared before Our countenance. This is of My bounty unto thee. Be thou grateful before the face of thy Lord and be of them that show thanks. We have accepted this visitation of thine. This is a word We have caused to shine forth from the horizon of creation and it shall endure as long as God endureth. This is yet another bounty that hath encompassed thee from One Who is Mighty, Beautiful.\n\nWert thou to ponder on that which hath proceeded from the mouth of the Divine Will, thou wouldst remember the Lord of all creation throughout all thy days and be enkindled with that Fire wherewith the hearts of them that are near have been set ablaze. Convey My remembrance unto thy brother Husayn and give him the glad tidings of My mention of him. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Say: Be ye steadfast, O loved ones of God, in His Cause, then make mention of Him with wisdom and utterance. Beware lest ye transgress the bounds of wisdom. We have made it another sign from your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Hold fast unto it in all conditions. Thus have ye been commanded aforetime and in this perspicuous Tablet. Through wisdom do We educate Our loved ones. It is My adornment amongst those who have turned unto God and are of them that are well-directed.\n\nO Zayn! Glorify on My behalf those who are in thy land, then impart unto them that which hath sprinkled upon them from this surging, encompassing, mighty, and exalted Ocean. The name of each one of them hath been mentioned in the Tablets of thy Lord. This is of His bounty unto them and unto His believing servants. Then make mention on My behalf of the handmaidens of God who are there and give them glad tidings through this Wise Remembrance. Upon them and upon them all be the Glory of God, thy Lord, so long as the Dove warbleth upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree. The Kingdom is God's, the One, the Single, the Peerless, the All-Informed.\n\nExcellent is what thou hast mentioned concerning Asadu'llah and what thou hast desired for him regarding the proof of servitude. Blessed art thou, O Zayn! By My life, this is a station that no other station can equal, were people possessed of insight. Blessed is he who hath adorned his temple with the ornament of servitude unto God, the Truth, and blessed is he who layeth his face upon the dust in humility before the Lord of Lords, turning unto Him. This, verily, is the praiseworthy station with thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Wise. Make mention of him on My behalf, then send unto him this fragrance which We have sent from the direction of the Throne that he may inhale the sweet scents of the garment and arise to praise his Lord at all times. Say: Be thou assured by the grace of thy Lord that thy name hath appeared before the Face. God hath absolved thee of thy misdeeds and hath ordained for thee in the Tablet an exalted station. Were We to mention the effects thereof throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the Dominion, it would never end. Thy Lord, verily, is the Ruler over what He willeth. He detaileth unto whomsoever He pleaseth whatsoever He desireth and aideth those who have turned unto Him through His grace. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Generous. O Lion! Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord, then aid Him in His land. Say \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be to Thee, O my God, for having moved Thy Most Exalted Pen to make mention of me. Ordain for me, O my God, that which Thou lovest and with which Thou art well-pleased, for I know nothing and Thou art the All-Knowing.\n\nThen make mention of 'Ali on my behalf. Say: Be not grieved at being debarred from the precincts of the Divine Purpose. Be content with what God hath ordained for thee. He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth. He is indeed the Sovereign over all the worlds. Blessed art thou for having turned unto God and hastened unto Him. This turning hath been recorded by the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is better for thee than all thou witnessest and beholdest. Be not grieved at anything. Put thy trust in Him in all matters. He is with His servants who seek Him. Beseech God, thy Lord, to make thee steadfast in His Cause. He ordaineth for whomsoever He pleaseth that which is best for him. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Most Merciful of the merciful. Aid His Cause through mentioning Him amongst His servants. This is the most meritorious of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. He is indeed informed of all things. We have accepted thy migration in His path and thy return by His command, and have ordained for thee that which will gladden the eyes of them that are nigh unto Him. In His hand is the dominion of command and creation. He is, in truth, potent over all things.\n\nThen make mention of Isma'il who drank the choice wine of life in the days of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and bore hardships in the path of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Make mention of him on My behalf and convey unto him what We have sent down from the direction of the Throne, that the fragrance of thy Lord's utterance may be diffused throughout the land wherein he dwelleth. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Mighty, the Ancient of Days. Say: Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. Reflect upon what thy Lord hath endured in manifesting His Cause. Say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the seen and the unseen. God is well aware of thine exile from thy native land and thy drawing nigh unto another land. Grieve not on this account. This is what God hath written for Himself, as thou seest Him in the land of exile in a far-off prison. Arise to make mention of Me and to praise Me, then soar on the wings of detachment unto the atmosphere of My mercy and grandeur that thou mayest hear the call of the birds of My throne and the doves of My oneness. By My life! Through these are attracted the hearts of them that have sought the countenance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, in those days, and through these are wafted the sweet savors of the All-Glorious throughout all worlds. Thy Lord is indeed the Ruler over what was and what shall be. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God and its effects, make mention of Him with wisdom and clear exposition, that perchance they who slumber on the couch of idle fancies may arise at the call and turn towards this Quarter round which circle angels brought nigh unto God. Turn with thy heart unto the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say:\n\nI am he who hath turned unto Thee, and hath set his face towards the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, the Dayspring of Thine inspiration and the Manifestation of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst quicken all created things, to number me among them who have soared in the atmosphere of Thy love and who have remained steadfast in Thy Cause until Thou didst manifest unto them Thy sovereignty in Thy kingdom and Thy power over all that are in Thy earth. Then write down for me what beseemeth Thy greatness and Thy majesty. Thou art, verily, powerful to do what Thou pleasest. Thou art, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nO Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! Hearken unto that which thy Lord calleth thee from the direction of the Throne, then send it unto him who hath been named Abu'l-Qasim, that the call of his Lord may attract him and detach him from all who dwell on earth. Say: O servant, hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness. He will verily protect thee in truth. He is indeed the Almighty, the Powerful. When the fragrance of the garment which We have sent from the direction of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, wafteth over thee, turn with thy heart unto Him. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my Lord and my Beloved! I testify that Thou art my Creator and my Provider, and that Thy love preceded my love for my father and mother. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the monotheists drank the wine of certitude and the sincere ones partook of the Kawthar of assurance, and through which the breezes of forgiveness wafted over all created things, to protect me from those who have denied Thy signs, rejected Thy truth and repudiated Thy power. O Lord! Cause me to enter beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy mercy, then number me among those who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hands of Thy bounty and the Kawthar of utterance from the fingers of Thy mercy, that nothing may prevent me from turning toward Thee and arising to remember Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to ordain me as one of those who circle round Thee and gaze upon Thy countenance, detached from all things, and who move according to Thy will. Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise. Then write down for me that which is best in Thy sight and ordain for me to act according to Thy good-pleasure. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Great.\n\n=== END BH00719 ===\n\n=== START BH00720 ===\n\nO Afnan, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be sanctified above all mention and utterance and befitteth the court of the nearness of the sacred Lord of eternity, Who was not prevented by the clamor of the peoples of the world from His blessed purpose, nor was the Supreme Pen held back from its movement by the rejection and objection of the nations. It moveth at all times and summoneth all who are in the realm of creation unto God, the One, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nMy soul and spirit be a sacrifice for your service and for your mention. This evanescent servant was standing before the Beloved of the world on one of the mountains when the Name of God appeared. After meeting, he gave this servant a packet which included the blessed letter of your eminence. God knoweth that such joy seized me that every tongue of the Pen is incapable of its mention. Afterward, when returning to the Most Holy Court, while walking on that same mountain, the tongue of inner realities spoke these words: \"Blessed is the mountain that hath been made the place whereon Thy feet have trod, and blessed are the hills over which the breezes of Thy days of manifestation have wafted, and blessed is the land that hath been adorned with the robe of Thy bounty and perfumed with the fragrance of Thy raiment, and blessed is the sea upon which the ship of Thy Cause hath sailed.\" Then, in His presence, the tongue of grandeur spoke these blessed words: \"Read what thou hast brought.\" This servant read in full the first prayer that you had submitted. He walked a while and then spoke these blessed words: \"O servant who is present, repeat the mention of My Afnan.\" And then the second prayer at the end of your letter was read. He said: \"It behooveth him and these days that he remember his Lord in such wise as he hath remembered. Verily He is the Hearer, verily He is the Ever-Present, verily He is the Perceiver, verily He is the All-Seeing. O My Afnan! Thou wast created for My Day, to hearken unto My call, to behold My horizon, and to arise to serve Me. Verily thy Lord is the Teacher, the All-Informed.\"\n\nPraise be to God, thou hast attained unto the most great favor. Although this is known to thee now, it shall become more evident later and shall shine forth like the rays of the sun in the world, manifest and evident. O Afnan! I have presented, then I beseech Thee, O my God, to make me at all times gazing toward the direction of Thy good-pleasure, content with what Thou hast ordained for me in the heaven of Thy decree, detached from all else save Thee, firm in Thy love and Thy good-pleasure, and accepting of service to Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones. We have heard and found in thy words thy burning devotion, thy sincerity, and thy turning toward God, the Lord of the worlds, and in God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. And this is among the bounties that have had and have no likeness or parallel. Preserve it and be of the thankful ones. God willing, thou hast been and art confirmed. Ask of God that thou mayest in all conditions remain steadfast in this station. Say: O my God, my Beloved, my Purpose, my Helper, my Creator, and my Provider! I beseech Thee by the Name through which faces turned toward the lights of Thy countenance, souls soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, and through which all created things were moved and all possibilities hastened toward the direction of Thy grace and Thy gifts, to strengthen me to serve Thy Cause and enable me to remember and praise Thee. O Lord! I am he before whose face Thou didst open the door of Thy knowledge and made known to me the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation after the turning away of Thy creatures, and showed me the passing away of that in which most of Thy creation take pride. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty and power to protect me and to ordain for me that which will make me independent through Thy riches. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the survivors of the Twin Luminous Lights, it is clear and evident that you are being as considerate as possible. Today it is incumbent upon all to be mindful of this matter, though verily He is the All-Watchful, the Near One. Praise be to God that from the beginning you were enabled to serve the Cause. This servant beseeches God day and night that He may establish you in His service in such wise that your remembrance shall endure as long as the Kingdom and the Realm endure.\n\nAs for what you wrote concerning your message to the honored Afnan H.A. (upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory) asking him to be mindful of the survivors' condition - a few days ago the honored Ismullah M.H. attained the presence of the Throne. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke such words concerning him that from every letter thereof shone forth the sun of loving-kindness. At one point He said: \"O servant! We have verily assisted the Afnans and exalted them and honored them. That which has flowed from My Most Exalted Pen has been and shall be made manifest. Thy Lord is indeed the Mighty, the Powerful.\" I swear by His blessed utterance that this servant repeatedly prostrated himself in gratitude and besought the True One, exalted be His glory, that He withhold not this most great favor for even a moment.\n\nRegarding the matter of the hundred tumans which you wrote should not be deducted from the funds of the land of Kha and should be accepted from you - this matter found acceptance in the Most Holy Court. It behooveth everyone possessed of speech to praise Him, thank Him, and remember Him in His days, and to hold fast to the cord of His Most Generous Name.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the business ledgers of the Wronged One - on the first day when this incident occurred, He said that although the grief of this calamity is beyond measure, yet they have attained to infinite grace. \"We have ordained for him glory and exaltation, and in the end of days We adorned him with that which had been the hope of the sincere ones from time immemorial.\" He also said that this supreme martyrdom is the cause and means of the exaltation of the Cause and the manifestation of the trustworthiness and religiosity of God's loved ones among the people. Now it has become clear that truly that sanctified soul was in all conditions focused on the horizon of trustworthiness. Blessed is he and his brother. This servant testifieth that they have attained to that which none comprehendeth save God. Would that I had been with them and had attained to what they attained.\n\nAnother matter - the letter you wrote to Ismullah M.H. was also seen, and he has sent a detailed reply which will, God willing, reach your blessed sight.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about Khalil (upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory) having been somewhat indisposed - surely he has been adorned with the raiment of health by God. This evanescent one's offering of servitude and nothingness in his service depends on your kindness.\n\nAnother matter - after the incident in the Land of Sad, in those very days a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine will, and until now a copy has not been sent anywhere. In these days, as commanded, this servant has made a copy and sent it so that after you peruse the blessed Tablet you may send it to Mulla Rajab-'Ali (upon him be the Glory of God). This servant has also written a brief letter to him which should be sent along with the Tablet.\n\nAnother matter - due to the abundance of correspondence, this servant was not able to present a response to the letter from the honored Afnan Aqa (upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory). God willing, it shall be submitted later.\n\nAnother submission: the petition of his honour Mirza Ahmad was presented to the Most Holy Court. They accepted his return. It behooveth this Lord to receive the praise of the Concourse on High and the glorification of all who are in the heavens and on earth. A most mighty, most holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of will, and the same revealed script was sent, inasmuch as His Holiness the Most Great Branch (may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps) was not present. Therefore, the same original revelation in this evanescent one's handwriting was dispatched. That Holy Being and this servant beseech and hope from God, exalted and mighty be He, that He may cause him to remain steadfast upon His straight path and confirm him in the heights of remembrance, praise, abstinence and godliness. Verily, He is the Protector of those who turn unto Him and the Helper of those who remember Him. There is none other God but Him, the King, the Truth, the Mighty, the Great.\n\n19 Hajj 1296\n\n=== END BH00720 ===\n\n=== START BH00721 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and power!\n\nYour letter was received and its fragrance brought the utmost joy and delight. God willing, may there flow from the pen of the loved ones of the All-Merciful that which shall be the cause of spirit, life and joy to all creation. Since a question was asked, this servant deemed it necessary to write and send an immediate response so that the truth of the matter might become clear and evident to you and other loved ones.\n\nAlthough the sanctity and purity of the Cause is manifest and radiant like the sun at its meridian, yet in view of your request, this is submitted: You wrote that you were perplexed by certain behaviors of some women. One such as yourself should never be perplexed by these matters, for you have spent much time in the Holy Presence and have directly heard most of the divine utterances which have been the cause and means of educating the servants and advancing the peoples of all lands. Whoever acts contrary to these is indeed among the disappointed and the losers, as He has said, \"even if they be among the kindred.\"\n\nSome practices were early customs among the people of the Bayan which were prevalent among them and which they followed without right, as you and other loved ones know that before this Most Great Manifestation, most of the people of the Bayan practiced that which accorded with no religion or law, and which no person of intellect or insight would accept. Then the Sun of Manifestation dawned forth. From the years of His sojourn in Iraq until now, which is the seventeenth day of the month of Jumadi in the year 1291, wondrous tablets have been successively and continuously revealed from the heaven of divine Will, forbidding all rejected and unpleasing matters, and commanding the divine ordinances which have been the cause of salvation for all.\n\nIndeed, from the horizon of every tablet the Sun of utterance has risen, shining and manifest in this regard. Today it is incumbent upon all to hold fast to the cord of sanctity and to grasp the hem of purity. O brother! The pearl of the Cause has remained hidden due to unseemly deeds, and this is the universal cause that has led to the hesitation of humanity. Otherwise, from all regions and lands you would hear the cry \"I have turned toward Thee and hastened unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world!\"\n\nIn Iraq, after the dawning of the Daystar of the horizons, He forbade all from certain matters. Some, in accordance with the command, abandoned them, while others, though under the shadow of the Truth, continued to practice what they practiced, but it was concealed. Likewise in this land there is no outward government to enforce the divine laws. The Truth has been and will be wronged. None hear from Him save those who are brought near. This is why the deeds of those who act purely for the sake of God cannot be equated with the deeds of others, for such a person has no fear of outward punishment. Therefore if a good deed appears from someone, it is for God's sake and thus is counted among the most excellent deeds.\n\nBy God, besides Whom there is no other God! Those souls who have entered this land, whether female or male, whenever they have attained the presence of the Throne, all have been commanded to perform good deeds and \\[...\\]\n\nLet the upright character, the praiseworthy attributes and the avoidance of carnal desires be your adorning. Well is it with him who hearkens, and woe unto him who turns away. These are His words, exalted be His glory: \"Say: Forbidden unto you is adultery and sodomy and treachery. Abstain therefrom, O concourse of those who advance! By God! Ye have been created to purify the world from the defilement of evil passions. This is what the Lord of all men enjoineth you, if ye be of them that comprehend. Whoso claimeth to be of the All-Merciful and committeth what the Evil One hath done - he, verily, is not of Me. To this testifieth every kernel and stone, and beyond them this truthful and trustworthy Tongue.\"\n\nThese exalted words have issued from the mouth of Him Who revealeth the verses, and this servant hath presented them exactly as they were revealed. Whoso acteth, acteth for his own self; and whoso turneth away, turneth away to his own loss. Verily our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. If people knew how much sorrow, grief and anguish these matters have caused the Ancient Beauty, they would all engage in lamentation and weeping. In the early days, certain actions appeared from the leaders of the Bayan that caused the people to become veiled and to hesitate. Were this servant to mention the deeds of some which he himself witnessed, it would cause all to be astonished. Had this Most Great Revelation not appeared, the matter would have remained obscure to most people. Through divine favors and exalted Tablets, many of the loved ones dwelling in various cities and villages attained the robe of sanctification, and in some lands they strove with utmost effort to act according to divine commandments which benefit humanity, and they became sanctified from rejected deeds. However, some have remained fixed in their old habits. We beseech God to assist all to do what befits His days and is worthy of His beauty, and through which His firm and mighty Cause may be exalted.\n\nO my master! Most souls are weak - at the mere sight of lightning they melt like snow before fire. Where are those steadfast, firm and tranquil souls who say that if all the women of the world should appear in full beauty and adornment, and all the treasures of the earth be displayed before them, they would never turn towards them, for such souls are intoxicated with the wine of the beauty of the All-Glorious. Their intoxication is the sovereign of sobriety, and their sobriety the source of effacement. Indeed, Moses appeared from the house of Pharaoh, while Abu Lahab was from the household of the Messenger. God willing, may you ever gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and strive with all effort to shatter the idols of self, so that perhaps through your efforts and those of the friends of God, unworthy deeds that have caused the people to become veiled may be eliminated from among mankind. In these days this exalted verse was revealed from the Supreme Pen - these are His words, exalted be His glory: \"It behooveth whosoever hath believed in God to proclaim the truth and strive to remove falsehood from amongst the people.\"\n\nAll must arise to render this service which is the cause of sanctifying souls and advancing those who dwell in all lands. Consider the days of the Apostle of God \\[Muhammad\\]. On the day of His ascension, nearly one hundred thousand souls or more from surrounding regions were present in Medina and its environs. Most of these individuals were considered companions in custom, for they had associated with Him. Nevertheless, those who acted upon His teachings and were God-fearing were found to be few in number. Verily, grace is in God's hands - He singles out whom He pleases by His command. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. In truth, this question of yours was most welcome, for most people are weak and veiled from God's good-pleasure and that which is beloved in His sight. This much has been written that the sincere servants of God may understand that which is beloved and acceptable unto God and from which the fragrance of the garment of the All-Merciful is wafted throughout all worlds. We praise and thank Him for this. Verily, He is the Protector of the thankful. Convey to his honor Aqa, the Most Truthful Name of God, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, the most wondrous, most impregnable, most holy greetings from this evanescent one. I have been and am mindful of the other loved ones, upon them be the fragrances of God, and I beseech them all not to forget this servant in their prayers. May glory be upon you and upon them.\n\nThe Servant 66 \\[of God\\]\n\n17 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1291\n\n=== END BH00721 ===\n\n=== START BH00722 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in greatness and power!\n\nThe essence of praise and the jewel of glorification befit the tracing of the Most Exalted Pen, which was not prevented from its call by the clamor of the divines nor the rattling chains of the composers. At all times it moved in the arena of wisdom and utterance in such wise that all the worlds of the unseen, by that movement, turned toward the Friend. Now it is hidden, but God shall soon make it manifest through His justice. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. This movement shall not be seized by stillness, nor shall this call be followed by silence. Blessed are they who have attained unto the hearing thereof. These are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, whose mention God hath revealed in the Qayyumu'l-Asma. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou at Whose mention all mention boweth down, and at Whose light's dawning all lights humble themselves. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all things and didst open the cities of the Kingdom of Names, to assist Thy servants in Thy remembrance and praise, and to enable them to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! This is Thy Day which Thou hast preferred above all other days and hast mentioned in the Books, the Psalms, and the Tablets. I beseech Thee by it and by what beseemeth it to send down from the heaven of Thy Will upon Thy servants that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, make them recognize Thy path, cause them to hear Thy verses, and teach them what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Nothing can frustrate Thee, nor can any matter prevent Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty. O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones who were not deterred by the might of the oppressors from turning to Thee, nor were they frightened by the pharaohs from facing toward Thy direction. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and decreest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThe petition of that dear one was presented by this servant in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and was graced with hearing. Concerning what thou didst ask about the earth and what the wise have said about it: in truth these matters have not yet been fully discovered. This is the truth, and beyond it is naught but error. However, the philosophers of this age, having received a portion of the light of this Manifestation, are more knowledgeable than those who came before. They have not yet fully discovered the number of planets; soon it shall be revealed and added to the previous count. This science is a fathomless ocean. Each fixed star has its planets, and each planet is a world among the worlds of thy Lord. Who can count the hosts of thy Lord therein, or the creations of His servants therein? The spirituality of the Spirit adorned the world of the Gospel, yet its people are heedless, walking in the wilderness of error and sleeping on the couch of negligence. They have not awakened from the trumpet blast, nor have they risen from the graves of their desires. Soon shall they witness the recompense of their deeds. Verily, thy Lord is the Just, the Wise.\n\nAs to thy question concerning the spirit and its movement, know thou that pure and sanctified spirits, detached from earthly conditions, have been and ever shall be the educators of the world of being. By the Life of God! After their ascension, they exercise supreme influence and power. They have ever been, and shall remain, all-encompassing and supreme. This station hath ever been guarded and preserved, sealed with the Seal of Divine protection, and treasured in the vault of infallibility. The tongue faileth to describe it, and minds and hearts fall short of comprehending it. The first interpreter, enthroned at the head of creation, is the tongue itself, which hath repeatedly confessed its powerlessness. What hath been mentioned regarding this station hath been solely through Divine grace and favor. Let this much be clear and evident: that pure and sanctified spirits who ascend from this world in the light of detachment are mighty causes for the education of the world and the appearance of crafts and wisdom. In the first rank, the purpose of sending Messengers and revealing Books hath been this: the purification of souls, the refinement of spirits, and their sanctification and detachment. Blessed are they who today have attained unto the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and have perceived the fragrance of His garment. O friends! This is the day of pure deeds, the day of mention and praise. Strive ye that ye may attain unto that which shall cause the fragrance of being to be forever inhaled throughout all kingdoms. Say: Take ye the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, then observe that which ye have been commanded therein. He, verily, is the Commander, the All-Wise.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned regarding business and transactions, these matters have been made dependent in the Book of God upon consultation. Let them consult with faithful and upright souls concerning their business dealings and the like, and whatsoever is decided, let them act upon it, placing their trust in God. This is God's decree and His command. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned regarding the Rights of God, this pertaineth exclusively to God, exalted be His glory. It must be sent to the Holy Court. The matter is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Since thou hast inquired, this answer hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty. This matter is obligatory upon all, and the honor of all lieth in its payment, for it is the cause of the purification of one's possessions and the source of blessing and increase in bounty. Until now, people have been heedless of this matter. They strive to amass wealth, whether lawfully or unlawfully, to leave it for heirs whose fruit is unknown. Say: Today the Word of God is the heir, for the purpose of an heir hath been the preservation of name and trace, and it is evident that centuries and ages shall obliterate these remembrances. However, every word that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning any soul shall endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. This is the supreme bounty and the greatest favor. Let him who wisheth act accordingly, and let him who wisheth turn away.\n\nMention has been made of turning towards the prison. After the fire of oppression was kindled in the land of ?a, this land too was somewhat disturbed. False rumors arose. Therefore, wisdom dictated a pause. If they gradually turn, holding fast to wisdom, there is no harm. Acknowledgment is not permissible in any place. Trusting in God, let one or two set forth. In all conditions they must not let go of wisdom until the clamor from that land subsides. They must not change those practices which they have previously followed, as a wisdom from God, the Lord of the worlds. Today the gaze of all must be fixed solely upon the Most Exalted Horizon. Whatsoever He commands, that is the decree of God amongst His servants. To this testifies He Who speaks: verily there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed.\n\nWe convey greetings to the friends and enjoin upon them that whereby the Cause is exalted, namely deeds and character that cause the elevation and advancement of the Word of God among His servants. The glory shining from the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have turned with their hearts unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Best-Beloved.\n\nWe convey greetings to the handmaidens of that land and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. All must, with utmost sanctity and detachment, be engaged in the remembrance of God throughout the days and nights. Every handmaiden of God who today attains unto hearing and is enabled to respond - she is recorded and inscribed among the leaves of the most exalted Paradise in the Book of Names. Rejoice, O handmaidens of God! Blessed are ye and joy be unto you! How many a man hath been debarred from the Truth, and how many a woman hath turned unto and attained recognition of God, the Most High, the Great. Praise ye the Best-Beloved of the worlds, Who hath chosen you from among all handmaidens and adorned you with the ornament of His own recognition. The glory shining from the horizon of My grace be upon you and upon those who have attained unto this glorious, mighty station.\n\n=== END BH00722 ===\n\n=== START BH00723 ===\n\nThe Branches of the Blessed Tree--may my spirit and whatsoever my Lord hath bestowed upon me be offered for their advent--convey sacred remembrance beyond the mention and thought of this evanescent one. May the spiritual friend, his honor Ahmad--upon him be God's peace and loving-kindness--take note.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nThe Book of God speaketh and the Sun of Truth shineth. The light of His countenance with the word \"Verily He is God\" is manifest and evident after the passing of all things. The Sun of the Will of the Peerless Beloved hath so encompassed all things with its effulgences that not a single atom among all atoms is deprived of its signs and verses. Yet heedless souls remain veiled and debarred from witnessing and hearkening. The Sun calleth out, yet ears are absent. Heaven crieth aloud, yet the power to hear is non-existent. The realm of manifestation is adorned with the ornament of true unity, yet sight is nowhere to be found. From a single will the ocean of bounty came into being, and from one drop thereof the world of existence became manifest and creation appeared. By virtue of His pre-existing mercy and all-encompassing grace, He bestowed sight and granted awareness. From His pure and absolute existence, He sent down proof and made clear the path. The King of the Path and the Manifestation of the Proof is He Who came with the truth, by Whose advent the Hijaz was adorned and from Whose fragrance Batha was perfumed, He Whose will was the Will of God, Whose desire was the Desire of God, Whose command was the Command of God, and Whose prohibition was the Prohibition of God. Through Him appeared His straight path and His firm and mighty command.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby Thou didst subdue all things, and by Thy Name which Thou didst make the Sovereign of names and the All-Ruling over earth and heaven, to send Thy blessings upon Thy Beloved, Whom Thou didst strengthen and exalt and cause to enter a station which the understanding of the world cannot comprehend nor the minds of nations grasp, and upon His family and companions whom Thou didst make the lamps of guidance among all creatures and the emblems of unity among kings and servants. O Lord! I beseech Thee by them and by their glory, might and power to protect Thy loved ones from the polytheists who have encompassed Thy cities and lands without any proof from Thee, and who have committed that which hath grieved the hearts of Thy chosen ones and the hearts of Thy messengers. O Lord! Send down from the heaven of Thy grace upon those who have turned wholly unto Thee and have acted according to what Thou didst command them in Thy Book that which shall endure as long as Thy names endure and Thy attributes persist. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom neither the clamor of the servants nor the turning away of those in the lands can hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised. And send Thy blessings, O my God, upon Thy loved ones and friends who hastened unto Thee and circumambulated Thy House by Thy command, who bore hardships in their turning unto Thee, whom neither the blame of the blamer nor the turning away of the heedless nor the sword of the oppressor nor the assault of the transgressor could deter in their love for Thee. They have turned unto Thee with radiant faces and illumined hearts. O Lord! Withhold not from them that which is with Thee, and ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and Thy loved ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Ruling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nAnd furthermore, O beloved of my heart! I had been contemplating the world and reflecting on the power of its Maker, its Creator, its Fashioner, and the visible signs of God and His manifest evidences, when someone arrived with your letter. I took it and opened it, and from it wafted the fragrance of love and affection, and the intoxication of the Kawthar of love seized me in such wise that the pen is powerless to describe it and the tongue fails to express it. I opened it and read it, and found in each letter thereof that which gladdened me and attracted me, for from it wafted the fragrance of the love of our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Then it was presented before our Master - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - and He said:\n\n\"O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! He who was present before the Wronged One with thy letter hath come, and he read before the Countenance what thou didst praise God therein, the Lord of all worlds. We found from it the fragrance of thy turning unto God, thy sincerity, thy devotion, thy certitude, thy submissiveness, thy humility, thy resignation and thy contentment in God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon thee from the heaven of His bounty that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and to make that which hath proceeded from thee in His mention and praise a treasure for thee in His heaven and a store for thee in His Kingdom. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Neither the might of the world nor the oppression of the idolatrous among the nations can prevent Him. He is the Single One, the Unique One, Who hath no likeness nor peer, and there is nothing like unto Him. Every possessor of knowledge and understanding hath testified to the sanctification of His Being and the exaltation of His Essence above all else. We bear witness to that which they who are endued with constancy among His Prophets have testified: verily He is the Single One, the Unique One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nLife came and bestowed life; spirit came and conferred spirit. What effect can this servant's movement and mention have, and what purpose can they serve? Every call is as nought beside the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen, and every utterance is lost before the Kingdom of utterance. However, since the word of permission hath appeared from the horizon of the Most Great Favor, therefore we hold fast unto His mention and praise, and offer a hundred thousand thanksgivings that this permission hath been granted and this honor hath been bestowed. The world is weary and the Lord is glorious, seated upon the throne of utterance. Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him, above my mention and the mention of those above me and those below me! By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, the letter of that loved one brought perfect joy and bestowed boundless delight. Prayers were offered at a propitious time and were honored to be heard. Well is it with your tongue and your pen! God willing, may they be confirmed and assisted at all times. This evanescent servant reflects how the idolaters have surrounded the lands of the unitarians, and such grief seizes him that he is truly unable to describe it. What hath caused these humiliations? The resplendent Law, with its supreme glory and its mighty sovereignty, is now witnessed in such a state. The eye weeps and the heart laments. What is the cause and what is the reason? In any case, we must all turn with the utmost lowliness and supplication unto the Self-Sufficing One, seek pardon for the deeds we have done, and ask forgiveness for the deeds we have not done. Perchance once again will the banner \"The Kingdom is God's\" be raised by the hand of power in the most exalted station. This is not difficult for the Mighty One to accomplish.\n\nTo my honored friend, His Grace Mirza, upon him be God's peace, providence and favors - I send greetings and remembrance. Praise be to God, you have been and continue to be remembered. The servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen him, grant him success, and manifest through him that which causes the monotheists to find the fragrance of their Lord's providence, the Generous Giver. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds. The mention of the beloved of the heart, one of the two Most Exalted Names, His Holiness 'Ali - upon him be God's peace and glory - was made and presented. They said: \"Excellent is what he has done, and excellent is he who has shown gratitude, praise and contentment.\" Thus it ended.\n\nWe must all, through the confirmations of God - exalted be His Glory - become possessors of virtuous character and be adorned thereby. From this matter great joy was obtained. I beseech God to grant him reward. And regarding what was written about the polished papers - this servant, upon seeing them, has seen and continues to see the countenance of that spiritual beloved reflected therein, and at times his presence appeared and appears before my sight. I beseech and hope from the Exalted Truth that He may strengthen that beloved one and grant him success. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers. Peace and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon God's righteous and sincere servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n10 Jamadi'th-Thani 1303\n\nThe specified amount was received through my beloved, His Grace Haji Siyyid Javad - upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Creation - and was adorned with the ornament of acceptance.\n\n=== END BH00723 ===\n\n=== START BH00724 ===\n\nThis is a Book revealed in truth wherein is that which draweth the peoples nigh unto a sublime and holy Paradise, if they remain steadfast in the love of God and His Cause and follow not those who have taken their vain imaginings as a god besides God and are accounted among the idolators. Verily those who have recognized God and the Manifestation of His Self in these days - upon them shall pray the angels of the Cause and they who circle round the mighty Throne. And as for those who have disbelieved in God and His signs, they are cursed by all things between earth and heaven, though none knoweth this save they who are endowed with illumined vision.\n\nO Firiburz! The Glory shining between earth and heaven be upon thee! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the Kingdom of eternity, and be not of the heedless. I have chosen thee for My love. Listen to that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of the Throne, that thou mayest be among those who attain unto the melodies of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nKnow thou that most of the people of the Bayan have turned away from God and disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed, and have clung to the cord of idle fancies and followed the ways of the deluded ones. We have found no people on earth more heedless than these, even after We commanded them in all the Tablets not to cling to anything created between the heavens and the earth at the time of the Manifestation. They have veiled themselves from those days with all things and have taken idle fancy as their lord instead of God, and thus were they among the prodigal. They have reached such heights in rancor and denial that when the verses of God are recited unto them, their faces darken and they turn upon their heels, becoming of those who turn away. They read what they possess of verses and argue thereby morning and evening, yet deny their like and their Revealer. Such is the state of these liars. They make mention of God throughout the night and day, yet when He appears in truth they deny Him. Nay, the curse of God be upon those who have lied and were among the calumniators.\n\nBy God! Naught shall be heard from these people save what thou heardst from the people of the Furqan when God came with His supreme and mighty sovereignty. Know thou that those whom We nurtured in secret and whose names We would mention openly for the exaltation of God's Word, lest the idolaters discover the seat of the Cause and become aware - these emerged from behind the veil and denied God's signs, even rising to attempt My murder in this remote and far-off prison. God was aware of what befell Me, while none besides Him knew aught of My suffering. He is verily the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the All-Informed. Nothing escapes His knowledge and nothing of what is created between the heavens and earth can frustrate Him, and He encompasses all things.\n\nSay: O people! Fear God and deny not Him through Whom your beings were created, your names were raised, your traces became renowned, and your spirits and the spirits of all creation were quickened. Thus did We suffer at the hands of these people. By God! The eyes of the world have never witnessed its like. If thou wert to become aware of My suffering, thou wouldst weep over My state and lament in thy days, fleeing from all who are on earth to dwell upon mountain peaks, crying out with the cry of the bereft.\n\nArise then from thy place and convey to the people the remembrance of thy Lord's name, the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful. Be sincere in the Cause for the sake of thy Lord, then emerge from the veils of fancy that thy face might be illumined by the lights of certitude. Soon shalt thou witness these people taking names unto themselves and worshipping them, just as thou hast found the people of the Furqan among the worshippers thereof. When they are asked, \"Who is your God?\" they will surely say \"God,\" yet when He appears with sovereign authority they deny Him and are among the proud. And if they are asked, \"By what proof did you believe in God in His Manifestation Who was named 'Ali before Nabil?\" they say \"The verses.\" Yet when God's verses, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful, are recited unto them, the fire of hatred seethes in their breasts and appears from their \\[...\\]\n\nThe soot of hell covers their faces and they arise in opposition in such wise that they well-nigh assault him who recites unto them the verses of their Lord. Thus do We observe them, and We are of those who bear witness. And We beseech God to shelter us in a land devoid of the faces of these heedless ones, and to sanctify our faces from the eyes of those who have disbelieved in God after their belief, and to purify our garment from the hands of the idolaters. Soon shall ye find yourselves bereft of this Youth, and shall not find Him though ye search throughout all regions and from every direction. Thus do We inform thee with truth that thou mayest be of them that know.\n\nO servant! Remember the time when thou didst enter the precincts of thy Lord's mercy and didst hear the verses of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and when the Sun of the Name of thy Lord shone upon thee and the lights of Beauty seized thee from behind the luminous veils while men were heedless thereof, for they were in gross delusion. And in those days the sun was shining behind the clouds, but when the appointed time was fulfilled, the clouds were rent asunder with manifest sovereignty and the Countenance appeared from the horizon of grace in such wise that its light filled the horizons and encompassed all created things. Some witnessed and understood, while others remained heedless and were among the veiled ones. Thus did God come upon clouds of glory and the matter was decided by One mighty and powerful.\n\nHearken unto what the idolaters say, that these verses were not revealed naturally. Say: Open your eyes, O company of the heedless ones! By God, by a single letter of what hath been sent down from the dominion of God, the Mighty, the Bountiful, nature and its sources and its manifestations were created. This luminous, wondrous and radiant Tablet beareth witness to that. Thus did they speak aforetime when the Sovereign of the Cause came to them in His name, the Most High, the Supreme, and before Him when the sun of the name of Muhammad shone forth with resplendent light from the horizon of Hijaz, and before Him when the Spirit came to them with the kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praised. Thus did they speak in the time of every Prophet and the age of every Messenger from time immemorial, and they will continue to speak until the end of ends. But thou, veil not thyself with the veils of these people, then rise from the horizon of utterance with divine expression, and remember thy Lord in the morning and in the evening. Fear no one in the path of thy Lord, even if all who are in the heavens and earth should rise against thee. Grieve not over anything and turn not unto the world and what is therein, for were it to have any worth in the sight of thy Lord, He would have chosen it for Himself and would not have left it to the enemies of His sanctified Beauty, the Mighty, the Resplendent. Its likeness is as the likeness of a shadow - doth it endure upon the earth? Nay, by My mighty and wondrous Self! And if it endureth, its duration would be but a day or part of a day. Thus hath the matter been decreed by One who ordaineth, powerful.\n\nSay: The Most Great Balance hath appeared and those who doubted the Cause of God, the Sublime, the Most High, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Wise, are in loss. Say: O people! The sovereignty of God hath been manifested in such wise as to encompass all things, if ye be of them that know. Arise from the couches of heedlessness, then aid Him through utterance, for this is indeed a beauteous permission. Verily, those who believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in part, these are they who are accursed in this world and the next, and are among the wrongdoers. Beware lest thou forget God's favor upon thee, for indeed His favor upon thee hath been great.\n\nShould adversity touch thee, seek the aid of My Name, the Helper, the Assisting, the All-Powerful, and through it God will dispel the affliction of those who have believed and are among the steadfast. To God belongeth the Kingdom of succor; He aideth whom He willeth through His sovereignty, and He is the Protector of them that do good. Thus have We cast upon thee the utterance of truth and revealed unto thee the Cause with a clear and manifest proof. Take thou the Tablet and recite it throughout the days. By God! It removeth sorrow from the hearts of them that have professed the unity of God, purifieth them from the defilement of polytheism, and draweth them nigh unto the presence of God, the Most High, the Most Great. And the light which hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and are among them that are assured.\n\n=== END BH00724 ===\n\n=== START BH00725 ===\n\nHe is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed\n\nO son of Dakhil! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most Beautiful! We have indeed read thy letter aforetime and responded to thee with verses that all the books of the world and whatsoever the peoples possess cannot rival, to this doth every learned and informed one bear witness. Beware lest the events of the world veil thee from the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, or the affairs of men debar thee from this perspicuous Book. We have heard thy call and have responded to thee with this wise Remembrance, which God hath made the Kawthar of life for all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and the Salsabil of knowledge for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thou art he who heard the Call and turned toward the Supreme Horizon in this exalted station. Neither the clamor of the idolaters nor the croaking of the croakers deterred thee. Thou cast away what the people possessed and took hold of My perspicuous Book. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions to remember Him, to praise Him, and to proclaim His decisive and wise Cause.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the friends of the All-Merciful in Mamaqan, that the Remembrance may draw them to a station wherein nothing on earth shall prevent them from turning toward God, the Lord of all worlds. Take the chalice of eternity in the name of your Lord, the Creator of heaven, then drink therefrom in spite of those who have denied the signs of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed are ye for having turned toward Him when the people turned away, and for having responded when silence had seized all upon the earth save whom God, the Almighty, the Powerful, willed. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you. We beseech God to aid you to remain steadfast in this mighty Cause. Blessed is the house wherein My remembrance is raised, and the tongue that uttereth My praise, and the eye that beholdeth this luminous horizon.\n\nAnd We make mention of My loved ones in Shishvan and give them glad tidings of God's favor at this time. O My friends in that place! Hear My call, for it will draw you near unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Blessed are the faces that have turned toward the lights of the Countenance and the hands that have taken hold of the Book through this Name, whereby the limbs of the idolaters have trembled. We have mentioned you before and counseled you with that which will exalt the Word of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Beware lest the utterances of the people of the Bayan, who have turned away and denied God, the Lord of the mighty throne, prevent you. We counsel you with that which God hath counseled His near servants. Adorn your heads with the crowns of faithfulness in the realm of creation and your temples with the ornament of supreme steadfastness from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Verily the One, the Single, desireth to make mention of His friends in Khurmazard, that the Call may draw them to the Supreme Kingdom and strengthen them to serve His Cause on this wondrous Day. The Call hath been raised from this most exalted station. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained; he is indeed among those who are nigh unto God, the Lord of Lords. We beseech God to inscribe for them from His Most Exalted Pen the reward of attainment unto His presence, and to ordain for them that which will delight their eyes. Rejoice in My remembrance and My call, then drink the choice wine of My utterance from the chalice of My bounty, in spite of the people of the Bayan who turned away from the All-Merciful when He came with power and sovereignty. Thus do We set forth the verses as a grace from Our presence, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe have desired to turn toward the direction of Our friends in 'Ajabshir and give them to drink of the water of life from the hands of the mercy of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O My friends in that place! Hear My call from the direction of My prison, for it will guide you to a station which God hath made the point round which circle the Concourse on High, morning and evening. How many a servant hath turned toward Him and believed, how many a poor one hath hastened and attained, and how many a prince hath been prevented from drawing nigh unto God, Who causeth the winds to blow! We counsel you to be steadfast in this Cause, through which the hearts of the daysprings of idle fancies have been shaken.\n\nO Pen! Turn thy face toward the M and R, and illumine My loved ones there with the lights of thy utterance and remind them of thy verses. Beware lest the clamor of the people of the Bayan prevent thee from the remembrance of the All-Merciful. Leave them and what they possess, turning unto God, the Lord of all men. O people of M and R! Where is the warmth of your love, and where are your raptures and your fragrances? This is the Day of remembrance and utterance, did ye but know, and this is the Day whereon the Herald hath called aloud, could ye but understand. The Resurrection hath come to pass, yet ye remain seated. The world hath been set ablaze by the fire of My Lote-Tree, yet ye perceive it not. The ocean of utterance surgeth before your faces, yet ye see it not. He created eyes for this manifest Cause and ears for hearkening unto this exalted Call. Beware lest the might of the polytheists hold you back from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest the oppression of the oppressors frighten you regarding this momentous News, whereby the hearts of the wicked and the worshippers of error have been sorely troubled.\n\nO son of Dakhil! Convey My greetings to the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One. The people of the Bayan, meaning those who have turned away from the Straight Path, are debarred and deprived of the Great News. They have clung to that which the former party clung to and have walked in their footsteps. Consider now the baseness of the people's nature. The Shi'ih party on the Day of Reckoning was as a handful of dust in the sight of God. From the very pulpits whereon they made mention of the Letters, they cursed the Perspicuous Book, and now they revile the Mother of the Book and the Mother of the Bayan, thinking they are rendering service to the Faith. By the waves of the ocean of utterance, the Faith hath ever been and shall forever be quit of such souls. Even as ye witness, the Law of God lamenteth and the foundations of God weep by reason of the tyranny of the oppressors. The Tablet and the Pen are engaged in lamentation. We beseech God to aid all and adorn them with the ornament of justice and fairness. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. The glory from Us be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those who have not broken My covenant and My testament and who have acknowledged that which the tongue of My grandeur hath spoken in this exalted station. The loved ones of God are each remembered and have attained His favors. Say: O Almighty One! The Chosen One hath come, yet the people are in manifest doubt. Hearken unto the Call from the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Paradise in the highest Heaven: Verily there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO 'Abdu'llah! Thy name was present before the Wronged One. We have mentioned thee in such wise as naught can equal. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the nations, for having aided me to acknowledge Thy Cause when every stubborn oppressor denied it.\n\nO Ibrahim! The Book hath been sent down, the verses have appeared, and the evidences have proclaimed: The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the worlds. Know thou the station of the Word - it will deliver thee in all the worlds of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon My loved ones and My handmaidens there who have believed in God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.\n\nThe letter of Mahdi, upon him be My glory, was considered. Praise be to God, it was illumined with the light of faith. We beseech God to aid him in that which will cause the exaltation of his station. Regarding his stay in the land of T and his journey to the land of M and H, about which he inquired - these matters depend upon consultation, and whatsoever emergeth from the consultation of the chosen ones, that is the decree of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention of him as We mentioned him before, and We give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded, and My grace which hath encompassed all, whether small or great.\n\nAnd We make mention of him who was named Mulla Hasan, whom thou didst mention in thy first letter, that he may rejoice and say: \"My God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having guided me and made mention of me and caused me to know Thee and taught me, whilst I was among the heedless ones among Thy creatures and the deluded ones among Thy servants. And all thanks be unto Thee for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of immortality through Thy Most Glorious Name, in spite of Thine enemies. O my Lord! Assist me through Thy bounty and generosity, and enable me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause and to exalt Thy Word. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThou didst make mention of Adi-Gozal. Praise be to God, she hath attained unto mention and praise. Her remembrance hath flowed from the Supreme Pen and her name hath been uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur. Give her the glad-tidings, from Me, of the favors of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Verily, We have made mention of her in such wise that her remembrance shall endure in My perspicuous Book. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My loved ones in all lands who have rent asunder the veils in the name of the Lord of all beings, and who have entered the City through My mention, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\n=== END BH00725 ===\n\n=== START BH00726 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!\n\nPraise be to the One True Goal, Who made straight the path and sent forth a guide. In every station He placed a treasure and gave tidings thereof. His chosen ones have been and continue to be His true treasures. They are the repositories of the mysteries of the Prophets and the pearls of the knowledge of His pure ones. The path has led to the straight way, and the announcement to the Great Announcement. Through Him He brought to an end prophethood and messengership, and promised the appearance of the Day of Resurrection and the Hour, and the manifestation of His power on that Day. Exalted be His might, His sovereignty, His glory, and His grandeur! And blessings and peace be upon Him Whom He made the Dawning-Place of His names, the Dayspring of His attributes, the Treasury of His knowledge, and the Source of His Cause, and upon His family and companions through whom God's Cause encompassed the East and West of the earth, and through whom was revealed that which was inscribed in the Books and their verses. The servant beseecheth his Lord by them, and by their power and might, and their deeds and sincerity, and their humility and submissiveness, that He may assist Islam as He assisted it in the beginning, that the whole of religion may be made manifest, though the polytheists may detest it.\n\nAnd then, O beloved of my heart! Although each of your letters was a volume telling of the sorrows experienced in separation, God is my witness that this servant too is utterly dejected and grief-stricken from separation from the loved ones. However, since beautiful patience shall be rewarded with abundant recompense, we must hold fast to it and cling thereto. Furthermore, since that beloved one's intention in all matters has been service, therefore it is recorded and inscribed among the most excellent of deeds. In this case, they should at all times be adorned with the ornament of joy. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to grant confirmation that they may attain to that which is acceptable and remembered in His presence.\n\nAt a time when mention of your presence and your services was emanating and flowing from heart and tongue, two letters arrived addressed to that beloved one from his honor the Deputy and his honor Aqa 'Ali Haydar, upon them be the glory of God and His favors. After they were presented, He said: \"The loved ones should look to that which is good. It is not fitting to object to one who is commissioned to serve. 'Ali Haydar is in truth occupied with service. All should be content, not complaining. Glory be to God! Until now they have not gained awareness of what is befitting. Acceptance and rejection belong to God, exalted be His glory. They should look to and be content with what hath been revealed in God's Book. Blessed is the one whose will is dissolved in the Will of God and whose desire is merged in His Desire. O Amin, write a greeting to the Deputy and 'Ali Haydar. Let them hold fast to what is good and be detached from the world. Praise be to God, they have attained recognition and are occupied with service. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for them that which shall endure in the realm of being throughout the duration of the Kingdom. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\" And may He assist them to achieve what befits His days. They have ever been and continue to be remembered. In all conditions We beseech for them that which shall never perish, and likewise We beseech God to grant them the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. And We counsel all to wisdom and to that whereby the station of man is exalted. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower. End. This evanescent servant also conveys greetings and praise to them and beseeches God for assistance.\n\nThe letter that was addressed to that beloved one was sent, and another letter also arrived from his honor Haji Muhammad-'Ali (M.Y.), upon him be the peace of God, addressed to that beloved one. After it was presented, He said: \"O Amin! You have repeatedly mentioned him and the other friends. You have established a right upon all. Write to him on behalf of the Wronged One: Praise be to God, you hold fast to and stand firm in that which is right. You have been and continue to be mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He withhold not His favors from you at any time, nor keep back His mercy. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. O Amin! What he wrote is acceptable and correct. Give him and those with him the glad-tidings of the Wronged One's mention. Verily We have mentioned him time and again that he may rejoice and be among those who have attained.\" End. His letter too was sent. Let them take note. This servant also conveys greetings and praise to them and all others. In all conditions I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for assistance and confirmation for all. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the trust, God willing it shall reach that beloved one. Be assured of this matter. The beloved of the heart, His honor Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon him be God's peace and favors, sent a letter, but since that beloved one wrote that he would proceed to Batumi and from there to that direction, therefore the reply to his letter was not sent to Constantinople. I beseech the True Confirmer and Spiritual Sustainer that his reply be sent as well. His mention and that of the spiritual friend, His honor Aqa Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be God's peace, has been and is continuous. To the honored beloved, His honor Nabil Ibn-i-Nabil and his son who attained and won victory, and the son of the honored beloved, His holiness S.M., upon them be God's peace and favors and bounties, I convey greetings and praise, and I beseech from God, exalted be His glory, everlasting blessings and enduring bounties and a goodly life for all. Likewise to the friends of that land and the honored beloved, His honor Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be God's peace, I send greetings. Their mention has been and is in the heart.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The heedlessness and pride of the people of the world have deprived them of that which profits them. They were disturbed and distressed by the might of Islam and the power of its kings, and now matters have reached such a pass that every polytheist has arisen to perpetrate oppression and has brought about whatever he desired. Today all the people of divine unity must wholly hold fast to the cord of God's favors, and we must beseech and implore Him that He may transform this weakness into strength and this impotence into power. If no effort is made to make amends for what was lost, new losses will occur at every moment. The sleep of heedlessness has overtaken all, and the intoxication of passion has deprived all save whom God wills. This servant and that honored one and all must beseech the True Powerful One to first grant the success that all may be cleansed with the water of repentance and be adorned with the ornaments of trustworthiness, religiosity, chastity, truthfulness, sincerity, sanctity and faithfulness, and we must seek from Him that which is the cause of the exaltation, loftiness, ascendancy, elevation, glory and might of the people of divine unity. God is witness and well aware that what was said was for God's sake and the purpose was the exaltation of the Word of Unity, but the heedless ones have attributed it to corruption and have brought about that which pen and tongue are powerless and fall short to mention. In any case, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may not deprive His servants of the ornament of justice and fairness. He is the Hearer and He is the Answerer. I testify that there is no God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and in recognition of His singleness, and that He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is the Hearing, the Answering, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Peace be upon you and upon those with you and upon God's righteous servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n23 Safar 1304\n\n=== END BH00726 ===\n\n=== START BH00727 ===\n\nThe Most Esteemed Afnan, His Honor Haji Mirza Muhammad-'Ali, may the Most Glorious of all Glory and the Most Resplendent of all Resplendence rest upon him, is to behold with his luminous and pure gaze.\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise and thanksgiving beseem the Afnan of the divine Lote-Tree, who were not deterred by the hosts of idle fancies and the ranks of vain imaginings from the Most Great Announcement and the Straight Path. Through God's grace, they drank from the Kawthar of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" and partook of the Tasnim of \"He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.\" Neither the might of tyrannical Pharaohs nor the power of oppressive despots could deprive them of the dawning-place of loving-kindness and favor. With the finger of trust they rent asunder the veils, and with the arm of reliance they cast down the idols. Their eyes were fixed upon the Most Exalted Horizon and their faces were turned toward the light of His countenance. The diverse winds of the world could not shake their tranquility and steadfastness, nor could the perturbation and agitation of the nations find their way into their hearts. Glorified be He Who created them, caused them to know Him, drew them nigh unto Him, and exalted be He Who raised them up, preferred them, gave them utterance, showed them, and caused them to hear.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God, my Goal, my Beloved, the Beloved of the world, my Adored One and the Adored One of the nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Hour and its signs were made manifest, and the Resurrection and its tokens appeared, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon Thy Afnan that which befitteth Thy glory, Thy might, Thy generosity, Thy grace and Thy power. O Lord! Thou seest him in all conditions standing ready to serve Thy Cause and voicing Thy praise. He it is who turned to Thee on a day wherein they that dwell upon Thine earth turned away from Thee and they that inhabit Thy lands rose up against Thee. He spent that which he possessed for the exaltation of Thy Word, the triumph of Thy Cause, and the spread of Thy verses. By Thy glory, O my God! Were this servant to attempt to mention that which hath proceeded from him in Thy days, his pen would prove powerless and his tongue would fall short. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee and the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones, by Thy Most Great Signs and by Thy Most Exalted and Most Glorious Self, to cause his deeds in Thy days to appear from the horizon of bounty and favors, that all may witness their manifestation and their light even as they behold the sun and its effulgence and its radiance. I seek Thy forgiveness, O my God, for making mention of this station which Thou hast made to be above my station. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy oneness, from which Thy servants have been debarred, to aid him at all times to do that which Thou lovest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Help in Peril. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nMy spirit, my soul and all that I possess be a sacrifice for your love and for your steadfastness! This servant was sitting silent, contemplating the verses of God and the manifestations of His greatness, His might, His power and His sovereignty, when the Afnan--upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious--arrived with your letter. I took it and opened it, and from each of its letters I seemed to discover the fragrance of the love of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When I had read and understood it, the ecstasy of your love so overtook me that I soared on the wings of longing until I attained the presence of God, the Lord of the Day of Meeting, and I presented what was in the letter. And this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply--exalted be His utterance and sublime His proof:\n\nHe is the Hearing, the Answering\n\nO Afnan! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. The servant who was present came before Us and read that which thy tongue had uttered in praise and glorification of God, His might, His power, His sovereignty, His strength, His grandeur and His dominion. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth, and thy pen for having flowed with that wherefrom every person of understanding perceiveth the fragrance of submissiveness, humility and detachment in the love of God, the Lord of creation. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness that thou hast been illumined with the light of unity and hast drunk from the chalice of detachment while the people were in manifest error. By My life! None hath attained unto the Day of God and what hath been manifested therein save those who have cast away the world and clung to the Most Great Name, whereby the feet of the learned have slipped, the mountains of knowledge have been scattered, the limbs of the mystics have trembled, the hearts of the wise have been perturbed, and every oppressor remote from God hath lamented.\n\nO Afnan! I complain unto thee of those who have turned away from Him Who came unto them with verses that all the books of the world cannot equal. Were it not for Him, that which lay hidden in God's knowledge, the Lord of all worlds, would not have been revealed. Until this time they have not comprehended the Day of God, nor have they attained unto a drop from the ocean of the blessed word \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth.\" For in truth, had they been illumined by the light of this exalted word, they would have closed the door of objections and turned with their whole being toward the Beloved of all possibility. By God's life! The ears that exist in the world were not and are not worthy to hear this call, nor are the eyes capable of beholding the Supreme Horizon. This Day is a mighty Day and this Cause is greater than every great thing.\n\nPraise be to God! Thou hast attained repeatedly and hast drunk from the ocean of the Merciful's utterance. Thou hast preceded others in serving God and championing His Cause, as attested by Him with Whom is the Mother Book. We beseech God - exalted be His glory - to protect His servants from the vain imaginings of the heedless, oppressive, and deceitful souls. Ye must exert the utmost effort in this matter and seek protection for all from God. Verily, He is with thee and heareth what thou hast desired of the wonders of His grace and favors. He is the Hearing, the Responding One.\n\nUnder all conditions, the servants must be reminded that perchance they may drink from the ocean of awareness and attain unto the splendors of the lights of wisdom. If it accordeth with wisdom, convey on behalf of this Wronged One greetings to the loved ones of God and bid them to that whereby God's Cause may be exalted, that perishable things may not deprive them of God's everlasting bounties. All the Afnans of the Sacred Tree are mentioned in the presence of this Face and are the recipients of special favors. Convey greetings to the Leaves and give them the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My grace and mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning this momentous News.\n\nPraise be to God that the waves of the ocean of loving-kindness are manifest and the lights of the Sun of compassion are evident! When this evanescent servant attained the presence of His Holiness and presented his letter, the Sun of grace shone forth and appeared in such wise that this servant and his like are powerless and incapable to describe it. During the time of offering prayers, repeatedly this most exalted Word issued from the tongue of the Master of all beings: \"How excellent is that which the Afnan hath spoken on this Day of God, the Lord of Religions!\" The revealed verses themselves bear witness and testimony; no other proof hath been or is needed. By God's grace, His Holiness is adorned with that which beseemeth the Day of God. The honored Afnan, Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, arrived and mentioned that which His Holiness had uttered, and it was granted the honor of being heard at the Divine Throne. Likewise, all the passages mentioned in the letter were, praise be to God, granted the honor of being heard and were adorned and illumined by the lights of acceptance. This evanescent servant offereth greetings and praise to the honored Afnan, upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious--and from every light the most luminous, and from every beauty the most beautiful, and from every bounty the most glorious, and from every joy the most evident, and from every blessing the most abundant, and from every feast the most complete. He beseecheth God--exalted be His glory--and imploreth Him to assist His servants and grant them success in that which is befitting, that all may turn towards the ultimate goal and the most exalted horizon, and may not remain deprived of the outpourings of these days. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Praise and glory and remembrance and magnification and peace be upon you and upon those with you, and upon those who have attained to your service and your love, and upon every one steadfast and firm, and every one established and well-informed.\n\nThe Servant\n\nIn the month of Rajab, 1303\n\n=== END BH00727 ===\n\n=== START BH00728 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Wise, the Manifest\n\nAt this hour when the Most Great Luminary is rising and shining from the heaven of His love, one named Mehdi - upon him be My glory - sent thy letter which attained unto the gaze of favor and was honored by the hearing of the Wronged One. The souls mentioned therein have each ascended by the ladder of divine grace to the highest horizon, which is the station of turning to the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, and have attained thereunto. Verily, he who sacrificed himself by his own hand was in grievous error. The Supreme Pen hath ever forbidden such deeds in the Scriptures and Tablets. Today the friends of God, exalted be His glory, must occupy themselves with the promotion of His Cause, that perchance those souls who are drowning in the ocean of vain imaginings may find deliverance through the cord of the All-Merciful's utterance and be adorned with the armor of God's Word, and thus be protected from the arrows of the divines' doubts and the swords of the rulers' wrath. O Mehdi! We have, as a token of Our grace, forgiven him. Upon him and upon thee be glory. We counsel all the friends of God to act in accordance with that which hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Book. Say: O people, hold fast unto the Book of God - this is better for you, did ye but know it. The Book of God hath ever been and shall continue to be the Protector, Helper, Guardian, Supporter, Sustainer and Confirmer. Today the True One Himself is established upon this station and counseleth all unto that which hath been and is the cause of eternal and abiding wealth. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having shown me Thy highest horizon and caused me to hear the scratching of Thy Most Glorious Pen. I testify that Thou hast guided them that are on earth to Thy path, made them to know Thy proof, and commanded them to that which profiteth them in every world of Thy worlds. I beseech Thee by the billows of the ocean of Thy knowledge, by the standards which Thou didst raise up by Thy command, and by the signs which were elevated throughout the earth by Thy power and sovereignty, that Thou forgive Thy servants even as Thou didst forgive him who gave up his spirit in Thy path. O my Lord! Ordain for me and for them who have believed in Thee and Thy signs that which shall gladden the eyes and rejoice the hearts. Verily Thou art the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThou didst mention \\[Mirza\\] Sadiq - upon him be My glory - and likewise Mirza Ibrahim - upon him be My grace. Each hath attained unto the effulgences of the lights of the Most Great Name and been mentioned in the writings of the All-Merciful. We beseech God to aid them and grant them success that they may acquire eternal stations in these transient days. All the mentions of the world cannot equal one mention in this Day - this is a word to which the Lord of the worlds hath borne witness. O people of God! Strive that ye may attain unto that which hath no likeness or equal.\n\nO Baha'u'din! Hear the call of God, the True King, the Manifest. He mentioned thee before and mentioneth thee at this time. When thou art honored by His mention, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of them that know!\n\nO Ali, upon thee be My glory! Repeatedly have mention of thee and mention of him who ascended unto God flowed from the Supreme Pen. Reflect upon the heaven of divine grace - were all the peoples of the world to turn in less than that moment, all would be adorned with the robe of forgiveness and attain unto the greatest favor.\n\nO Qasim! Grieve not. Verily the ocean of joy hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison. Rejoice in its turning toward thee and say: Thine is the bounty, O Lord of Names, and Thine is the glory, O Thou Goal of them that are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO my God and my Heart's Desire! Thou hearest the cry of hearts in their separation from Thee. I beseech Thee by the light of union with Thee and the ocean of Thy bounty, that Thou mayest ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Within Thy grasp are the reins of the world and the affairs of nations, and Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nO My Pen! Make mention of the names that have appeared before Thy face and have attained unto Thy promise. Say: O Qasim! The Wronged One hath, from the precincts of the prison, remembered thee with a remembrance that hath no equal in all the world. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this manifest favor. We have mentioned thee time and again that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Gracious Lord. This is the Day of Joy, were ye to know it, and this is the Day of Gladness, to which testifieth He Who proclaimeth in every state that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO Rida! Hearken unto that which the Lord of Names calleth unto thee, that thy Lord may draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt arise to make mention of Him and praise Him among His servants with wisdom. Verily, thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nO Husayn! The Wronged One remembereth thee in the prison purely for the sake of thy Lord, that thou mayest rejoice in the loving-kindness of thy Lord and be of them that render thanks.\n\nO Baqir! We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and We counsel thee to be steadfast in this Cause, which the world hath denied, save those whom thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, hath willed.\n\nO Sadiq! When the Horizon of Revelation shone forth and the Promised One appeared, He was denied by every liar, every wrongdoer, every transgressor, every tyrant, and every stubborn oppressor. We found not from them the fragrance of truthfulness, to which thy Lord beareth witness from this exalted station.\n\nO Ismail! Reflect upon those who hastened to the sanctuary and offered up their souls in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind. Verily, thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Word.\n\nO Ja'far! We have guided the servants unto Our Most Great Path and have consigned the company of divines to the fire by the command of Him Who is the Lord of destiny. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nO Husayn! The All-Knowing hath turned toward thee and remembereth thee with that which shall strengthen thee to remain steadfast in His Clear Announcement. Beware lest the might of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of the worlds frighten thee. When thou hast attained unto My remembrance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Joy of the World, and praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of them that are nigh unto Thee.\n\nO Hasan! Say: My God, my God! I am he who hath turned toward Thee when he heard Thy sweetest call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy days and the fragrances of Thy verses to make me so steadfast in Thy Cause that the doubts of every remote scholar and every suspicious mystic may not hinder me.\n\nO Ma'sum! We have seen thy mention and have remembered thee. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Infallibility and Thy Most Mighty Signs to make me hold fast unto Thy protection, cling to Thy bounty, and adhere to Thy loving-kindness. Verily, Thou hast power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nO Siyyid Muhammad! Blessed is the servant whom the world hath not caused to slip, and the eye which the veils of names have not prevented. He hath cast aside the gulf, turning unto the Most Great Ocean. He is indeed of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nWe make mention of the Alif before the Qaf (Aqa Jan) and counsel him with that whereby the station of man is exalted. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted, and woe unto the heedless. We have counseled all aforetime regarding deeds and character. Blessed is he who hath held fast thereunto, turning away from every ignorant one who hath denied God and His verses shining from this luminous horizon.\n\nO Ramadan! The Object of all worlds hath made mention of all. At the time when any soul turneth towards the Most Exalted Horizon, mention of him floweth from the Tongue of Grandeur - this is a truth concerning which there is no doubt. The people of God must render thanks and attain unto the most great steadfastness, and must beseech God to preserve all from the vain imaginings and idle fancies of the former people. O Nabi! The Most Great Announcement proclaimeth and summoneth all to the Most Exalted Horizon. Beseech thou God that He withhold not the entire world from the choice wine of utterance and the Kawthar of divine knowledge, nor deprive them thereof. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Javad! The Lord of creation summoned all on the Day of the Call, but the heedless servants remained veiled and debarred, save for a certain number of letters before thy Lord's face. We beseech God that He illumine the people of that land with the lights of the Sun of Revelation, preserve them through His Name the All-Powerful, and make them steadfast upon the path through His Name the All-Conquering. He is the Mighty, the Omnipotent. The Glory be upon you, O My party from among My male and female servants. We beseech God to aid you to be steadfast in this Mighty Cause. And praise be to God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\n=== END BH00728 ===\n\n=== START BH00729 ===\n\nThis is a remembrance of that which was revealed in the year sixty in the days of God, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. Lo, the gates of Paradise were unlocked, and the hallowed Youth came forth bearing a serpent plain. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with crystal waters. Upon His face was a veil woven by the fingers of might and power. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty name. Upon His brow there shone a beauteous crown, which cast its splendour upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause. Upon His shoulders there fell the locks of the spirit, like unto black musk upon white and lustrous pearls. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a transcendent cause. On His right hand was a ring adorned with a pure and blessed gem. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty spirit. Upon it was graven, in a secret and ancient script: \"By God! A most noble Angel is this.\" And the hearts of the inmates of the eternal realm cried out: \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with an ancient light.\" Upon His right cheek was a mark whose sight caused every man of understanding to waver in his faith. And they that dwell behind the veil of the Unseen exclaimed: \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty secret.\" This is the Point from which the knowledge of the former and the latter generations hath been unfolded. And the denizens of the Kingdom intoned: \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty knowledge.\" This, verily, is the Horseman of the Spirit Who circleth round the fount of everlasting life. And they that lie concealed in the retreats of the highest heaven cried out: \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty unveiling.\" He descended from the tabernacle of beauty till He stood, even as the sun in the midmost heaven, arrayed with a beauty at once peerless and transcendent. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with the most joyful tidings! Standing in the midmost heaven, He shone forth like unto the sun in its meridian splendour, illumining the seat of divine beauty with His mighty Name. Whereupon the Crier cried out: \"Rejoice! This is the Beauty of the Unseen, come with a mighty spirit.\" And the Maids of Heaven cried out from their celestial chambers: \"Hallowed be the Lord, the most excellent of all creators!\" And the nightingale sang sweetly: \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, Whose like the eyes of the favoured ones of Heaven have never beheld.\" And lo, the gates of Paradise were unlocked a second time with the key of His Great Name. \"Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty name.\"\n\nAnd the Maid of beauty shone forth even as the dawning sun above the horizon of a resplendent morn. Rejoice! This is the divine Maiden, come with surpassing beauty.\n\nShe came forth with such adorning as to seize with longing desire the minds of them that are nigh unto God. Rejoice! This is the Maid of Heaven, come with alluring charm.\n\nDescending from the chambers of eternity, she sang in accents that entranced the souls of the sincere. Rejoice! This is the immortal Beauty, come with a mighty secret.\n\nSuspended in the air, she let fall a single lock of her hair from beneath her luminous veil--Rejoice! This is the Maid of Heaven, come with a wondrous spirit--\n\nShedding the fragrance of that lock upon all creation. Whereupon the faces of the holy ones grew pale and the hearts of the ardent lovers were filled with the blood of anguish. Rejoice! This is the Maid of Heaven, come with the sweetest fragrance.\n\nBy God! Whosoever closeth his eyes to her beauty hath fallen prey to grave deception and manifest error. Rejoice! This is the immortal Beauty, come with a shining light.\n\nShe turned, and round her circled the inhabitants of both this world and the world to come. Rejoice! This is the Maid of Heaven, come with a mighty dispensation.\n\nShe advanced, arrayed with a rare and glorious adorning, till she stood face to face before the Youth. Rejoice! This is the immortal Beauty, come with enchanting grace.\n\nFrom beneath her veil she drew forth her hand, golden tinged as a sunbeam falling upon the face of a stainless mirror. Rejoice! This is the immortal Beauty, come with a resplendent adorning.\n\nHer incomparable ruby fingers seized the hem of the veil that hid the face of the Youth--Rejoice! This is the immortal Beauty, come with a mighty glance--\n\nAnd drew it back, whereupon the pillars of the Throne on high were made to tremble. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause.\n\nThen did the spirits of all created things part from their bodies. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause.\n\nAnd the inmates of Paradise rent their garments asunder as they caught a lightning glimpse of His ancient and shining countenance. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with an effulgent light.\n\nAt that moment the Voice of the Eternal was heard from beyond the veil of clouds with a sweet and enchanting call. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty enchantment.\n\nAnd from the source of God's inscrutable decree the Tongue of the Unseen proclaimed: \"By God! The like of this Youth the eyes of the former generations have never beheld.\" Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause.\n\nAnd the maids of holiness cried out from the chambers of exalted dominion. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with manifest sovereignty. By God! This is that Youth Whose beauty is the ardent desire of the celestial Concourse. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause. Then did the Youth lift up His head to the concourse of heavenly angels--Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty spirit-- And gave voice to a single word, whereupon the denizens of heaven arose, one and all, to a new life. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty trumpet blast. He looked then upon the inhabitants of the earth with a wondrous glance. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty glance. And with that glance He gathered them together each and all. Rejoice! This is the immortal Youth, come with a mighty cause. With another look He signalled to a chosen few, then repaired to His habitation in the everlasting Paradise. And this, truly, is a mighty cause!\n\nThe Herald of Eternity proclaimeth from his cloud-wrapped throne: O ye that wait expectant in the vale of patience and fidelity! O ye that long to soar in the atmosphere of nearness and reunion! The celestial Youth, hidden ere now within the inviolable treasuries of God, hath appeared, even as the Sun of Reality and the Eternal Spirit, from the Dawning-Place of changeless splendour, adorned with the ornament of the Almighty and the beauty of the All-Praised. He hath rescued all who are in heaven and on earth from the perils of death and extinction, clothed them in the garment of true and everlasting existence, and bestowed upon them a new life.\n\nThat concealed Word upon which the souls of all the Messengers of God and His Chosen Ones have ever depended hath manifested itself out of the invisible world into the visible plane. No sooner had this hidden Word shone forth from the Realm of inmost being and absolute singleness to illumine the peoples of the earth than a breeze of mercy wafted therefrom, purifying all things from the stench of sin and arraying the countless forms of existence and the reality of man with the vesture of forgiveness. So great was the wondrous grace which pervaded all things that through the utterance of the letters \"B\" and \"E\" the gems that lay hid within the repositories of this contingent world were brought forth and made manifest. Thus were the seen and the unseen joined in one garment, and the hidden and the manifest clothed in a single robe; thus did utter nothingness attain the realm of eternity, and pure evanescence gain admittance into the court of everlasting life.\n\nO ye lovers of the beauty of the All-Glorious! O ye that ardently seek the court of the presence of the Almighty! This is the day of nearness and reunion, not the time for contention and idle words. If ye be sincere lovers, behold the beauty of the Best-Beloved shining clear and resplendent as the true morn. It behoveth you to be free from all attachment, whether to yourselves or to others; nay, ye should renounce existence and non-existence, light and darkness, glory and abasement alike. Sever your hearts from all transitory things, from all idle fancies and vain imaginings, that ye may, pure and unsullied, enter the realm of the spirit and partake with radiant hearts of the splendours of everlasting holiness.\n\nO friends! The wine of eternal life is flowing. O lovers! The face of the Beloved is unveiled and unconcealed. O companions! The fire of the Sinai of love is burning bright and resplendent. Cast off the burden of love for this world and every attachment thereto, and, even as luminous, heavenly birds, soar in the atmosphere of the celestial Paradise and wing your flight to the everlasting nest. For devoid of this, life itself hath no worth, and bereft of the Beloved, the heart is of no account.\n\nYea, the moth-like lovers of the All-Glorious at every instant offer up their lives round the consuming flame of the Friend, occupying themselves with naught save Him. Yet not every bird can aspire to such heights. God, verily, guideth whom He willeth unto His mighty and exalted path.\n\nThus do We bestow upon the dwellers of the mystic realm that which shall draw them nigh unto the right hand of everlasting life and enable them to attain unto that station which hath been upraised in the heaven of holiness.\n\n=== END BH00729 ===\n\n=== START BH00730 ===\n\nThis is a Book from this servant to those who have believed in God and His signs, and were among those who are guided by God's signs - for verily in the movement of leaves, the gushing forth of rivers, the holy manifestations in the mirrors of the righteous, the shining of the sun from the horizon of lights, and the rising of the clouds of grace are signs for those who walk upon the sacred shore and whose hearts are sanctified from worldly allusions and deceptive indications, and who soar on two wings of detachment in the holy and luminous atmosphere. There has come before Us a tablet from someone complaining about this servant in veiled words, after We had sheltered him on the shore of nearness and made him among those who are certain of their Lord's signs. Say: Have you not heard \"He shall not be asked of His doings\"? It is as though you were in the sleep of heedlessness and were among the slumbering ones. Have you not heard \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\"? This is from the command of God, the Mighty, the Ancient. If you do not understand these allusions, then I shall cast upon you other proofs that you may be at peace within yourself and be among those who know. Know at the outset that these words are from Us, but We did not direct them to all of you. We intended only those who claim to love God and then cast at Him a clear flame, who attribute themselves to God and the Manifestations of His Cause, yet afterward walk in the valley of heedlessness. Therefore be fair, O servant, after what has befallen the Manifestations of God's Cause which you have heard and seen, until matters reached such a pass that they expelled this needy servant from the land, as you yourselves witness and behind you the near angels bear witness. Until We entered this land and servants gathered around Us, and We loved them with utmost love and sheltered them in this land, desiring them to become standards of victory among all creatures, such that from their faces would shine the lights of divine unity and from their deeds and actions would appear signs of sanctity and detachment - and God bears witness to this if you be of those who know. We associated with them every day and every hour that perchance there might be kindled in their hearts the fire of love and they might be set ablaze with love for God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. We were at all times saddened by their sadness and among those who rejoiced at their joy. We did not exalt ourselves above them but were a companion to them, with them and among them, and you all acknowledge this if you be of the fair-minded. Therefore consider, after all this, what these deniers have done - claiming to love God while turning away through their deeds, reaching through their actions a point that has bewildered the minds of the knowing ones. We were aware of their deeds but since they were secret We concealed them and did not reveal what they had done. Yet they were not content with this until they made the matter public and thereby raised the standards of the corrupt ones. They turned to gross and impure directions and turned away from the direction of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. They followed their own desires at all times and hastened to do whatever their souls commanded them. Then after this they attributed themselves to God, the Lord of the worlds. Is it befitting for one who claims within himself love for God and the Manifestations of His Cause to then commit that which causes tears to flow from the eyes of the holy ones, after We desired for them to be \\[...\\]\n\nThey shall be the signs of sanctification in all lands, and shall be our supporters, and shall aid God with their souls, spirits, deeds and actions, and shall be among the victorious in the kingdom, such that if We command them to do something, they will not hesitate therein but will hasten to do what they are commanded. This is what We hope from them, if thou be of those who know. And We have counseled them in all the Tablets that those who claim belief in God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, should be such that if they were to pass by the kingdom of beauty and the temples of majesty they would pay no heed thereto. This is what hath been inscribed by the finger of power upon luminous and holy tablets. Likewise, should they pass by cities of gold, they would pay no attention nor turn towards them, that they might thereby become signs of sanctification in the dominion of the heavens and earths. Yet they have turned away from all this as though they had not heard a single letter from the Book. Then they followed whatsoever their souls commanded them, and God is aware and witness to all this. And whatsoever they do, people attribute it to Us, as thou hast heard in numerous instances if thou hast not forgotten, and its harm returneth to the root of the Tree, if ye be of those who are certain.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Do ye not witness how all the dogs of the earth have gathered against Me, and at every moment cast at Me the darts of hatred and animosity, such that were they to drink My blood, by God, the thirst of their hatred would not be quenched, nor would the fire of their opposition be extinguished? At all times they wait to attribute to Us deeds from which all people turn away in aversion. Despite all this, doth it beseem those who claim to love Us to assist them in their purposes, such that through their actions they cut off Mine arm and become supporters of the hypocrites? Say: O people! If ye will not help God and His loved ones, at least stand not against Him, and be not among the transgressors. By God! Were ye to discover the sorrow of My heart and the lamentation of Mine inmost being, ye would weep as those who have lost their loved ones weep, and would never laugh, nor would ye find joy within yourselves, if ye be among the lovers. For the lover is not content with that which displeaseth the One Whose love he claimeth, and walketh not save in the paths of the sincere ones. Therefore ponder within thyself, then bring thyself into the presence of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nIn whatsoever God hath commanded His servants in His ordinances, or forbidden them in His prohibitions, doth He seek His own good or your good? Nay, by Him Who holdeth My soul in His hand! He desireth naught save your preservation among the worlds. Do ye not witness how He cast Himself before His enemies, and how He sacrificed His spirit, His soul, and His body among all created things? By God! In this He desired naught save that His loved ones might find peace in the Cause and not be among the hesitant ones, and that ye might be assured within yourselves that this is truth from One mighty and powerful, and that those endowed with spiritual insight might testify that this was not in vain, and might be among the perceiving ones.\n\nDespite all this, how can We be content to abandon all that We have been commanded in the Book from Him, and commit that which We have been forbidden? Alas for Us, O concourse of lovers! By God! Then doth the lamp weep at My state and My poverty, and the Pen lamenteth My lack of helpers, and the Tablet crieth out at My loneliness. And I say: \"Sufficient unto Me is God. There is no power nor strength save in God, the Great, the Generous.\" We seek refuge in none save Him, and We seek help from none save Him. He is the best Helper and the most excellent Supporter.\n\nIf thou findest in thy heart the love of God, arise from thy place, then remind the people of their excesses against themselves and their transgression against God, if thou be among those who seek victory. Otherwise, remain tranquil in thy house and dwelling place. He will assuredly assist His Cause as He pleaseth, more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye. And in all this I say: \"Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, and the end belongeth to the patient ones.\"\n\nThen it behooveth them to return unto God and seek His forgiveness seventy times, that perchance He may forgive them through His grace and remit their evil deeds, and make them to be of those who have repented and returned with their souls, spirits and bodies unto God, the Mighty, the Praised. Let them take none as helper save Him, nor any companion except Him, nor any joy save from Him, nor any gladness except through Him. Thereafter, let them walk upon the earth with tranquility from God and dignity from His presence, in such wise that the angels of the worlds rejoice thereat, and let them ascend in their ascent unto God to such a station as is hoped for by the denizens of the pavilions of eternity and, beyond them, the concourse of the near ones.\n\n=== END BH00730 ===\n\n=== START BH00731 ===\n\nHe is God - exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Powerful!\n\nPraise be to God Who created the Point and from it detailed the knowledge of what was and what shall be, and with it adorned the books of the world, and made each of its letters proclaim that there is no God but Him. When the proclamation and call appeared, all things were attracted, and those near drew nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and the sincere ones to the Supreme Summit, making their ultimate goal the remembrance and praise of God and the fulfillment of what they were commanded in His Book. These are servants who have confined their affairs to that which exalteth the Cause of God amongst His creatures and the banners of His Manifestation in His lands. When the Point was detailed and knowledge and wisdom appeared, then He made it known to the one for whom it was created through His penetrating Will and His all-encompassing, all-pervading Purpose. He is the Master of the world, the Most Great Mystery, the Ancient Light, and the Sovereign of nations, by whose finger's gesture the moon was cleft and the gate of heaven was opened unto the Manifestations of Names and Daysprings of Command in the kingdom of creation. Exalted, exalted be His station! Exalted, exalted be His transcendent loftiness and elevation! He is the One before Whose manifestations of knowledge every learned one hath confessed his ignorance, and before Whose revelations of might and power every man of insight hath acknowledged his impotence. Through Him the horizon of origination was illumined and the mysteries of the Seal were revealed. He is the Hidden Light and the Treasured Book. Upon Him be God's blessings and peace, and upon His family and companions whom God made the knights in the arena of triumph and victory, and the dawning-places of might and power, and upon those who held fast unto them, spoke their praise, and aided them with their wealth and their own selves. These are servants upon whom no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. These are servants whom neither wealth nor children have occupied, and who say: \"Naught shall befall us save what God hath prescribed for us. In Him have we put our trust, and unto Him do all affairs return.\"\n\nThereupon, the servant received a letter from one of the two Most Exalted Names, upon them be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], containing what you had sent to him. When I opened and read it, I found myself sharing in your sorrows. I then proceeded to the Most Holy Court and presented your letter before the Lord. He - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - said: \"O thou who art present! Verily, tribulation is for the sake of love.\" In one station He declares: \"Were it not for tribulations in Thy path, life would have no sweetness for me,\" and in another station: \"Whenever the sun of tribulation dawns from the horizon of destiny, I stand ready before it.\" This Wronged One has been the target of tribulations and hardships in recent years, nay throughout His life, but whatsoever comes to pass of this nature shall soon pass into oblivion, having neither permanence nor stability. By My life! If the aforementioned soul were to become aware of the consequences of tribulations and afflictions that have befallen him, joy would seize him and he would engage in the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, with utmost gladness and delight. In truth, this Wronged One was saddened by what befell him, but as We fix Our gaze upon divine grace and favor, perfect calm and assurance is attained. Today is the day of supreme joy. The ocean of gladness is surging and the world is adorned with the raiment of delight. If on any day something occurs that causes grief, this is in accordance with divine wisdom, and surely joy will follow. Hearken unto what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"Verily with difficulty cometh ease.\" God is powerful, mighty, hearing and answering. If for a time the signs of His answering appear not, one should not be disheartened. By My life! All things testify that He is the Hearing, the Answering One. Assuredly He will answer and carry out concerning His friends that which is meet. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Let them not be sorrowful, but rather occupy themselves with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory.\n\nAs to what they wrote regarding the distribution and sale of properties, this is not permissible. Let them remain engaged with composure and dignity. Should God will and desire it, He will send down upon him mercy from His presence and grace from His side. They have been and are beneath His watchful gaze, and this is that sovereignty which neither perisheth nor can the hands of the oppressors reach it, nor can the eyes of the treacherous find it. Ask thou of God to preserve this most exalted station.\n\nAs to what was mentioned concerning her who hath ascended unto God, verily We have remembered her in such wise that her remembrance shall endure in the earth. Every fair-minded and discerning one beareth witness to this.\n\nHe is the Most Exalted, the Most High\n\nVerily, We make mention of a handmaiden among the handmaidens of God who hath ascended unto Him, even as We mentioned her before. I testify that she turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and believed in God at a time when most of His servants had broken His Covenant. We testify that she desired to plunge into the ocean of utterance, but We forbade her, as a wisdom from Our presence, and We mentioned her in such wise as nothing can equal it. We beseech God to forgive her, to remit from her whatever was unworthy of her, to sanctify her from all that His good-pleasure abhorreth, to draw her nigh unto Him, and to ordain for her what He hath ordained for His handmaidens who have detached themselves from all else but Him and have turned toward Him in such wise that neither the oppression of any oppressor nor the ascendancy of any froward tyrant deterred them. Peace and glory be upon her and upon every handmaiden who hath attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nPraise be unto God that thou hast attained unto that for which all men implore the Lord, exalted be His glory. The recompense of no soul hath ever been, nor shall ever be, lost in the sight of God. The reward of them that are nigh unto Him and are sincere, and the retribution of them that deny and are heedless, shall assuredly come to pass. Observe how the fruits of men's deeds became manifest and laid waste the land of Egypt, which was among the ancient cities of the world. These are the days of supplication, yet the people remain heedless. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn the world with the ornament of justice and equity, and to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world, and the good of what hath been sent down in His perspicuous Book.\n\nHis favor towards thee is manifest and evident, and out of pure loving-kindness mention was made of thy departed wife, upon her be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], which shineth forth from the Dawning-Place of grace. Blessed is she, and joy be unto her, and glory rest upon her. Though outwardly she attained not the cup of meeting before her ascension, yet after her passing she attained that whose fragrance shall endure throughout the kingdom that abideth forever.\n\nConcerning what was written about thy son Aqa 'Ali-Rida, upon him be the grace of God, it was submitted. He said: The people of truth must not be disturbed by outward differences. They must be as firm and steadfast as a mountain. This world, its beginning and end, its bounties and favors and ornaments, have not been, nor ever shall be, worthy of mention. By the Sun of the heaven of divine utterance! Had it possessed worth even to the extent of a needle's eye, the people of God would not have abandoned it, nor would they have accepted such tribulations. With utmost kindness and compassion, convey greetings from the Wronged One to him and say: Grieve not. Wert thou to become aware of the favor ordained for thee, thou wouldst find thyself in such joy as is sanctified from all the sorrows of the world. Verily, We make mention of thee, console thee, and counsel thee to be patient and forbearing, and to that which manifesteth the station of man among all possibilities.\n\nGod willing, may this mentioned favor and recorded kindness bring him joy. Peace be upon thee and upon God's sincere servants who are firm, steadfast, and upright, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n28th of the honored month of Shawwal 1300\n\nRegarding the properties of that honored lady, upon her be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], it was submitted. He said: We have given permission to Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], to take charge of them himself.\n\n=== END BH00731 ===\n\n=== START BH00732 ===\n\nO beloved \\[Ruhani\\], may his honor Aqa Muhammad Kazim take note.\n\nIn the name of Him Who caused the suns of holiness to dawn from the horizon of sublime glory, and in the name of our Lord, the Most Glorious, the Most Splendid.\n\nO Word of Holiness! Rejoice within thyself, for God hath made thee sanctified from the intimations of them that are veiled. O Countenance of Fellowship! Be glad within thine essence, for God hath purified thy heart with water that hath flowed from the right hand of the mighty throne, and hath singled it out for His love, and hath caused thy face to turn unto His face, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Powerful. O Leaf of Divine Knowledge! Take delight in thine inmost being, for the radiance of bliss hath shone forth from thy countenance, and the breezes of grace have encompassed thee, and thy Lord hath given thee to drink from the cup of holiness and the pure wine of paradise.\n\nThereafter, two leaves from thee, which gave voice to the melodies of the birds of the divine Lote-Tree, reached Us, and from their wondrous tunes, heartfelt joy and inherent gladness were made manifest. Praise be unto Him Who created thee and fashioned thee by His word \"Be\" and it is, and raised thee up in truth, and inspired thee with that which gladdeneth the hearts of the yearning ones and kindleth the fire in the souls of the lovers. I swear by the Sun of the dawn of inner meanings that its heart-attracting fragrances perfumed the paradise of the heart, and its sweet scents guided the city of the soul with the holy fragrance of the Beloved. Well is it with thee, O servant, then blessed art thou, O servant who hath arisen to serve thy Lord, and hast committed thy affairs unto Him, and hast turned thy face toward the court of His good-pleasure. Thus doth God raise up whom He willeth, and transform whom He willeth, and change whom He willeth, how He willeth, and none hath wished save as He, by His command, hath wished, and thus hath His will encompassed all in the worlds through His sovereignty.\n\nFurthermore, thy petitions were presented before the Throne and were read in their entirety, and were accepted in His presence, and this is a bounty sufficient for thee and sufficient for all the worlds. Then from the heaven of grace and favor and the clouds of holy benevolence, the rain of mercy was showered upon thee in such wise that none save the Ancient Being Himself hath been or shall be capable of reckoning it. A wondrous, sublime, and most exalted Tablet was revealed especially for thee, and a Tablet for thy brother, and a Tablet for thy sister, and a Tablet for Aqa Muhammad Hasan, whose names were mentioned in thy letter, were brought to mind before the Throne, and from the horizon of favor, according to what God had ordained for them, wondrous and sublime verses were revealed and sent forth, that their eyes might be consoled, their hearts gladdened, their breasts sanctified, and that they might be numbered among the thankful. And praise be to God, for He is the Beloved of them that know.\n\nAnd furthermore, that which you mentioned regarding being blessed by divine grace and attaining the presence of God - indeed the sincere lover has had and shall have no other aim. This was mentioned before the Throne and I submitted it, and from the right hand of the Throne these words were revealed: \"O Kazim! Praise God that thy letter, purified from the allusions of all who are in the heavens and earth, was presented before the Greatest Scene. Blessed art thou in that nothing prevented thee - thou didst, through the power of the Friend, shatter the idols of the Glorious One and didst tear asunder, through God's might, the veils of all else but Him.\" And at this time, which was the most mighty of times and most noble of seasons, mention of thee was made before the Throne. Now be content with this much, for the corruption of the new opposers has come between the eyes of the loved ones and the Beauty of the Adored One. Therefore be patient, then show forth yet more patience, until God brings His command. Verily He doeth what He willeth through His command and judgeth as He pleaseth through His sovereignty. None can repel His command or reverse His decree. Verily He is the Sovereign, then the Protector, then the Omnipotent, then the Most High, then the Powerful. And verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Here end the words of God. We hope, God willing, that at all times the grace of the Lord of the Worlds will assist you through the outpouring of the fire of love and the manifestations of rapturous utterances, in such wise that from its fire frozen hearts shall melt and through its rapturous manifestations the veiled hearts shall be attracted. Praise be to God that He enabled you to suddenly rend all veils and, without allusion, to dwell upon the Most Glorious Horizon. O how wondrous is this bounty! By God the Truth, were people to be even slightly aware, they would surely observe that a bounty hath appeared the like of which hath never been nor shall ever be from the beginning of creation. Alas for those who are veiled and heedless! We hope that this fire which was ignited in that Tree shall ever increase, for verily He is the Answerer of those who petition and the Bestower upon those who seek.\n\nAnd furthermore, unity with the loved ones of God hath been and shall ever be supremely beloved in the sight of God, especially with the Name of God Jinab-i-Javad, upon him be the glory of God and His radiance. And upon thee be the Spirit, then the Light, then the Glory, then the Majesty.\n\nRegarding the matter of the 600 tumans which you gave to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Rida-Quli, and concerning which you had mentioned that guidance be given from the Source of the Cause as to what should be done, I laid the matter before the throne. He answered: \"Write: Do not concern yourself with this, for the world and its ornaments have no permanence. We have accepted from you double that amount, for verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Whatever transpired in the past, when you mentioned it before your Lord, therefore no blame resteth upon you. Divine grace is of such magnitude that He accepteth from you that which you have not done in His path, by virtue of that which hath appeared in your heart whereby the treasures of the heavens and earth are created - and that is My love. This indeed is the Truth, and after Truth there is naught save manifest error. When thou didst attain unto this, thou didst attain unto all good from One Who is Mighty, Powerful. However, strive thou to protect it from the arrows of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. Thus hath thy Lord's favor been completed unto thee, and His grace upon thee, and His bounty toward thee, that thou mayest thank God, thy Lord, and that thy face may be illumined at all times with the lights of manifest holiness. Through this the hearts of the wicked are consumed and the hearts of the righteous among the concourse of the near ones are made glad.\"\n\nRemain settled and occupied with your affairs in complete calm and dignity, for it is beloved before God that each soul should exert maximum effort in his affairs, after placing his trust in God, his Lord. Therefore, continue to engage in your commerce, which hath ever been and shall ever be beloved before God. Likewise hath the Tongue of God spoken this word: \"O Kazim! Soar with thy love unto God, inasmuch as the breezes of joy have wafted over thee from all directions. Yet thou canst not comprehend what hath befallen thy Lord from one whom He reared night and day and taught speech as they teach parrots in India. When he had learned a word or part of a word, he grew proud before God as leadership over the rabble of the earth possessed him, until he pronounced the death sentence against Me without any proof from My All-Powerful, Almighty, Invincible Self. Would that he had stopped at that! When the hosts of victory were sent down and God preserved His invincible and mighty Self, he raised an outcry and reversed what he had intended against My wronged, grief-stricken, sorrowful Self, after he and all people knew that I had ever been powerful over him and knew what was within him. Despite this, I concealed and protected his person from the harm of every harmful one and from the injury of all creatures. When the sun of assurance dawned upon his back, he stirred within himself and stung Me like a serpent each day, nay, each moment. Thus were the words of God fulfilled in truth and justice, and there is none to change His firm, fixed, mighty and wondrous words.\"\n\n=== END BH00732 ===\n\n=== START BH00733 ===\n\nIn the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nExalted, exalted is He Who has removed divisions and established unity!

The Supreme Pen has removed the distinctions between servants and handmaidens, and through perfect grace and all-embracing mercy has established all upon a single plane. He has cut asunder the back of vain imaginings with the sword of utterance and has erased the whisperings of idle fancy through His mighty, prevailing power. All tongues in creation fall short of offering thanks for this bounty, and all hearts in existence fail to enumerate its blessings.

I beseech Thee, O God of the seen and unseen, Who guideth all to turn toward Thy Name, the All-Loving, to strengthen her with the hosts of Thine invisible realm to mention and praise Thee among Thy handmaidens. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the One, the Single, the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nThereafter, the letters of that honored lady arrived, and from each was evident the bounty of faith and recognition. Praise be to God that thou art engaged in the mention and praise of God, exalted be His glory. After reading and reviewing them, they were taken to the Most Exalted Horizon, the Supreme Station, the Most Glorious Spot, and were presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, attaining the honor of His hearing. These are His mighty words, exalted be His utterance and manifest His proof:\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous\n\nO My handmaiden and My leaf!

The praise rendered unto Him this day cannot be equaled by all that is possessed by the peoples, the treasures of the earth, and whatsoever is with the princes and kings. The Lord of the Kingdom beareth witness unto this at this manifest hour. We have heard thy yearning and thy lamentation, and have answered thee with a Tablet that calleth betwixt earth and heaven, and maketh mention of thee in such wise as to immortalize that which hath proceeded from thee in His love, His service, His remembrance and His praise. He hath made all that hath issued from thy lips a trust with Him. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Shouldst thou hear, with true hearing, that which hath been revealed unto thee at this hour from My Most Exalted Pen, thou wouldst soar upon the wings of longing in the atmosphere of the love of the Lord of the Day of the Covenant, and wouldst say throughout the days of thy life: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of them that have recognized Thee!

God hath loved faithfulness, and in view of the special favor that hath been extended to him who hath ascended unto God, the names and remembrances of those related to him have not been effaced from the Crimson Tablet, but rather are inscribed therein by the Most Exalted Pen. All must recognize the value of this most great bounty and supreme gift, and preserve it as they would their heart and soul, their sight and spirit. This Wronged One beseecheth the ocean of favor and bestowal that He may aid the people of that household to act in accordance with that which hath been revealed in the Book from the Pen of Command, and likewise enable them to succeed in that which would cause the spread of His signs.

Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto that which God hath commanded, and likewise blessed is the leaf that hath been moved by the breezes of His Will. This bounty is great and this station exalted. His grace and generosity are ever-manifest and evident. Who is able to thank Him for His continuous bestowals and successive favors?

In them the cry of God is raised concerning that which the fingers of hatred from every detested polytheist have wrought against Him. Say: O people! Sever not the arm of God with the swords of rancor, nor His head with the blade of hatred. Fear God, and quench not His fire amongst you, nor deprive yourselves of the outpourings of this grace. Verily those who deny the mercy that hath descended from the clouds of the Command - these have taken idols as lords for themselves besides God, and Beauty hath been veiled from their eyes. And if they witness, they do not truly witness. Thus have We created them deaf, without sight, and made them dumb, gathered upon the earth of abasement. Say: Those who object to the Self of thy Lord, and yet make mention of the Point of the Bayan - these dwell in the depths of the fire, and these, on that day, cast behind the veil of passion, are thrown upon the dust of self. Say: O people! Do ye make mention of the Sovereign of the Bayan while disbelieving in His Self? Woe unto you for that which Satan hath cast into your souls. Fear God with true fear, then sanctify your souls from the touch of Satan and his followers. Verily, he is a manifest enemy unto man. Those in whose hearts thou findest the odor of hypocrisy regarding the Light of the Command - these shall never find in the Mother Book any portion allotted unto them. Say: If ye love the Point of the Bayan, why have ye acted against His sanctuary, and disbelieved in His verses after their revelation, and distorted the word which had been inscribed by the Pen of God in all the Tablets? Indeed, ye have taken fancy as your lord besides God, after ye had been known in the realm of names by the name of God. Hearken, O people, unto the Word of God, then drink from the pure wine, then warm yourselves at the fire which was kindled from the direction of the Throne. Say: O people! By God, the Truth! We took a handful of clay and breathed into it a spirit from Our Command, and adorned it with the garment of names between earth and heaven, and made it renowned among the worlds. When it reached maturity, it rose against Us, then objected and rebelled against God Who created it by a command from His presence, until it pronounced judgment against Him. Thus was man ungrateful to his Lord.\n\nO My Name! Remind the people of that which the Most Great Spirit hath spoken before the throne of thy Lord. Then be steadfast in the Cause in these days wherein the Manifestations of the Names stand motionless at the Bridge. By God! All that thou hast heard concerning this Cause and that We have indicated to others hath been by virtue of a wisdom from God, thy Lord, and none save a limited number have been apprised thereof. They who speak what they speak are but wandering in the meadows of ignorance and roaming in the wilderness of polytheism - these are they who in that Day were debarred from the gardens of knowledge. Say: O concourse of the blind! Heal your eyes with the collyrium of the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, that ye may perchance discern that which even the most perspicacious among all creatures have failed to perceive. O My Name! By God! For twenty years I stood before Mine enemies, while they who today rebel against God remained veiled behind curtains, fearful for themselves. When We raised up the Cause through Our sovereignty and might, and when the breezes of assurance and glory wafted, they emerged from behind their veils and drew the sword of hatred against Him through Whose glance earth and heaven were illumined. If thou wouldst then incline thine ear with sanctified hearing, thou wouldst hear that which would cause hearts to be consumed behind the pavilion of exalted glory. Soon shalt thou witness the people of the Bayan doing all that the people of the Furqan had done, such that they will cling to their traditions and be veiled thereby from the Creator of Names and Attributes, and they will speak as they spoke and argue as they argued. Indeed, thou shalt find these even more veiled than the peoples of old. Thus have We revealed unto thee that which hath descended from the heaven of grace, that thou mayest be possessed of insight into thy Lord's Cause and remain steadfast, such that the whisperings of Satan may not cause thee to slip from the path that hath been extended by God's leave across the paradise of the Cause. Beware lest thou be perturbed in these days wherein souls are agitated and minds are bewildered, and wherein the lowing of the calf is raised with a mighty cry. Hold fast to the handle of the Cause, lest the winds from the manifestations of phantoms should move thee. Then take up an extolled station in the shelter of thy Lord's protection. Say: O people of the Bayan! Were ye not enjoined in the Book not to deny the verses of God when they are sent down in truth, and not to reject them through your conjectures and desires? Why then have ye turned away from them and denied Him in Whom ye believed? Fie upon you for having broken God's covenant and His pledge, and for having been debarred from the shore of effulgence emanating from this Beauty. O people! Consider the proofs of the Prophets and Messengers and that which hath been revealed in the Bayan, that ye may perhaps make good what ye have neglected and find a way unto Him Who occupieth the throne. Say: If ye have believed in the Point of the Bayan, by God, this is His very Self and these are His verses, sent down from a sublime and glorious kingdom. O My Name! By God! These people have violated the sanctity of God in their midst by following those who were created by My command - and God is witness to this. The matter hath reached such a pass that they have written tablets of falsehood in the name of the Point of the Bayan to oppose Me, and have circulated them among the people to turn them away from the path that was visible from the direction of the throne. Say: By God! The Most Great Ocean will not be altered by the touch of dogs, nor will the beauty of the Sun be obscured by this cloud that hath come between them and the Lord of Lords. By God! It hath shone forth with the sovereignty of majesty and stood at the pole of \\[...\\]\n\nNay, whoso is guided aright is guided for his own soul's good, and whoso turneth away - verily thy Lord is independent of all who turn aside and are rejected. We give thanks unto God that He hath purified the garment of sanctity from the touch of the idolaters and hath severed the hands of the infidels from this hem. And thou, arise thyself, then say: O people! Fear ye God and deny not His proof after He hath appeared with the truth, if ye believed in Ali aforetime through what was sent down unto him of the verses of your Lord. Therefore read ye what ye possess, and We shall read a tablet from the traces of this Manifestation. By God! Then shall the sun of certitude shine forth from the horizon of a luminous dawn. Then shall ye find their heads cast down, and the scourges of divine constraint shall overwhelm them from the presence of One mighty, self-subsisting. Thus have We cast it unto thee that thou mayest cast it upon the breasts which thou findest free from doubt. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, whether male or female.\n\nO My friend! Grief hath so encompassed this wronged One that the mention thereof melteth the heart. The world hath ever been, and shall forever be, a place of trial and testing. From its chalice none hath ever drunk save deadly poison, and from its cup none hath ever tasted save fatal venom. Its afflictions have ever been the portion of them that seek the Truth, and its calamities the share of them that pursue His path. Beware lest thou be saddened by its sorrows or grow heedless of the remembrance of the All-Merciful in these days. In all matters place thy trust in God and detach thyself from all else but Him. In these grievous days when the intoxication of existence hath encompassed all creation, be not heedless of the celestial realm of His love's constancy, and like unto the sun, shine forth with the effulgences of the love of the Sovereign Lord of names and attributes, that the lights of the beauty of the Chosen One may be made manifest through thee among the servants. Gird up the loins of endeavor to stand firm in His Cause, and be thou free and detached from all else save Him. The world hath no faithfulness, and ere long whatsoever is visible upon earth shall be hidden in its depths. And the Spirit be upon thee.\n\nAnd the prevention of that friend from the nearness of the meeting hath been the cause of the winds of discord, and after the great separation and the calming thereof, God willing, it shall be made manifest according to the exigencies of the time.\n\n=== END BH00734 ===\n\n=== START BH00735 ===\n\nPraise be unto Him Who is worthy of all glorification - He Who, through the Most Exalted Pen, hath raised up hosts and through them hath conquered the cities of men's hearts.

They must raise high their resolve and manifest before the faces of the servants the essence of trustworthiness and detachment, and whatever is in the first instance most beloved and desired by them, they must bring to the notice of the evaluators for sale and give to the followers of the Faith. O Mirza! These are the days for such action and the expression of such words. Not every day hath this excellence. Rise not merely upon hearing the Word of God - if thou art in bed, come forth; if seated, stand up; if standing, hasten with utmost speed to complete that which thou art commanded. This is the firm decree that hath appeared from the court of the Most Great Name. Take it with hands of submission and acceptance, and be of them that act. O Mirza! If thine eye should oppose thee in what God hath commanded, pluck it out; if thy rib should oppose thee, divorce it; if thy brother, abandon him, holding fast to the cord of God's commandments, the Lord of the mighty throne. By My life! None shall profit thee save Him, and none shall deliver thee save Him. Take God's decree with strength from Him and power from His presence, and be not of the patient ones. By My life! My commandments and My laws are manifestations of My loving-kindness to My creation and dawning-places of My mercy to My servants. Verily thy Lord is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. Glorify on My behalf the faces of My loved ones there, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the lights of My wondrous utterance. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon them that love thee and hear thy word concerning God's mighty announcement.\n\nThe end.\n\nFrom the very divine verses and the fragrances of commands and laws that have been revealed, the station of the doers has become distinguished from the neglectful ones as light from darkness. It is hoped that the honored master, His Holiness the Afnan, the honorable Aqa Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, will taste the sweetness of God's command and decree, especially in this deed with which he is charged, through the execution of which the rivers of trustworthiness, religiosity and truthfulness will flow and spread throughout the world. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. He commandeth not His servants save that which benefiteth them and preserveth them. To this testifieth every insightful believer.\n\nMention of the ascension of His Holiness the Afnan, the honorable Aqa Mirza Mahmud, and the child, and the leaf who was the sister of the wife of the late honored one, upon them be the Glory of God and His mercy, has repeatedly been made in the Most Holy Court, and at every moment a mention from the heaven of the Most Great Mercy specifically for them hath been revealed that their names and remembrances may endure forever. And at this time these manifest verses have been revealed - His mighty utterance and mighty mention:\n\nIn My Name through which the ocean of forgiveness surged in contingent existence\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of lords, he who was named Mahmud in the heaven of names. He is among those who attained the love of God and His remembrance, as the Most Great Book beareth witness to this in its most exalted station. Blessed art thou, O Mahmud, in that thou hast been mentioned at this hour by the Tongue of Grandeur, which when It speaketh, all things speak: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.\" Through My remembrance the ocean of forgiveness surgeth, and the fragrance of God's mercy, the Lord of all religions, is wafted abroad. We beseech God to forgive thee, to pass over thy transgressions, and to ordain for thee the reward of what escaped thee in His days. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nI desire at this hour to make mention of My leaf who took the cup of My love from the hand of My bounty and drank it in My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to cause her to enter the Most Exalted Paradise and to associate her with the leaves who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn, and to ordain for her in the highest chambers a noble station and an exalted dwelling place. We have, verily, purified her at the time of her ascension, adorned her with the ornament of My favor, and sent down upon her from the heaven of My bounty a mercy from My presence. I am, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O My leaf! Behold, then remember the grace of thy Lord. Thou art in the Most Exalted Paradise while thy Lord mentioneth thee in the prison of 'Akka. Through the breezes of His remembrance at this hour, the fragrances of loving-kindness and favor are diffused in all regions. The radiant light shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty be upon thee, O My handmaiden and My leaf, and upon the handmaidens who have turned unto God, hearkened, and believed in God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Chosen. We have made mention of the child in his station with a remembrance whereby the hearts of the righteous are attracted. Here endeth the utterance.\n\nUnto Him be praise, glory, thanksgiving and bounty. His favors have at all times been and continue to be directed towards the Afnan, in such wise that none can deny it. This lowly one beseecheth the True One to aid all to act in accordance with that which they have been commanded, for that is the supreme remedy for every illness and malady. Verily, He is the Helper of those who act and the Educator of all who are in the heavens and on earth. The greetings and praise of that honored one were conveyed to the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - and to the people of the pavilion \\[of greatness\\]. Each one expressed their consideration, and they beseech and hope from the Exalted True One that He will cause that honored one to return soon to the divine homeland. They say that there hath not been and is not any prayer better, more beloved and more desired than this. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you and hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\n=== END BH00735 ===\n\n=== START BH00736 ===\n\nO Sulayman Khan! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise befitteth and beseemeth my Beloved Who, with the finger of might, hath unsealed the seal of the Choice Wine and, with the hands of bounty, hath bestowed it upon all peoples. Whosoever turned unto it, partook thereof and attained unto the infinite divine bounties, and whosoever turned away remained, in truth, deprived of the fruit of existence. A hundred thousand regrets and sorrows that while the hands of the mercy of the All-Merciful proffer the water of life, most of the people of the world remain bereft thereof and wander, in utmost bewilderment and heedlessness, through the wilderness of idle fancies. This Wine is, in one sense, the Word of God that lay hidden in the treasury of everlasting knowledge and was sealed with the seal of protection, and in another sense it is the recognition of the Dayspring of Names--a recognition that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen, not one born of vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul that hath attained, recognized and partaken thereof, and woe betide those who have turned away by following every heedless and remote one. Should this servant attempt to explain and set forth this station as it truly is, the pen would assuredly prove powerless. I beseech God not to deprive the peoples of the world of the fragrances of His days. Though all days belong to God and are from God, yet this Day hath been singled out, even as mention hath been made of it in the heavenly Books, Tablets and Scriptures, and they who are endued with vision have perceived it and hastened to the supreme Scene. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have attained unto the Water of Life in the days of their Lord, the All-Merciful. God willing, ye shall, through divine grace, illumine and revive darkened hearts and gloomy souls with the light of the divine Word. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of understanding that if a soul should arise to serve the Cause for the sake of God, he will assuredly attract the hearts of men and draw them to the most exalted horizon. The Command is in God's hands--He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nThis evanescent one submitteth to your honour that this servant hath been honoured to receive your letter, and whatsoever was inscribed therein was presented at the Most Holy Court. He said: \"God willing, through the blessedness of the Most Great Name, they must enlighten and guide some of the people of the world who are somewhat free from idle fancies and suppositions and are illumined with the lights of certitude, and must draw them to the eternal city. Many souls are observed to be exceedingly remote. When will the hand of the mercy of the All-Merciful draw them to the ocean of nearness and reunion? He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Take thou the cup of life in the name of thy Lord and say: O concourse of possibility! Hasten ye and come unto that which hath been ordained for you. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that for which ye were created. Fear ye God and be not of them that are veiled.\"\n\nAnd as to what you wrote concerning Siyyid Abdullah, it is most strange that this servant has neither seen him nor been informed of his circumstances. Many are the souls who have caused and continue to cause corruption and waste in God's Cause. The world hath no constancy, and these continuances after which we see one creation come and another go, outwardly display their own extinction at every moment, but eyes are lacking to perceive it. In any case, we beseech God to guide the rebellious, transgressing, heedless souls and confirm them in the knowledge of their own selves, that perchance they may not exceed their bounds nor rise up with calumnies. Once these blessed words were heard from the Blessed Tongue, saying: \"Behold the Cause as a temple whose spirit is detachment and whose wings are the fear of God. Blessed is he who adorneth himself with the fear of God and detacheth himself from all else.\"\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning that treacherous thief - had people acted in accordance with trustworthiness, religion, and that which was commanded from the Source of the Cause, all would assuredly have been observed in the utmost comfort and glory. The horizon of trustworthiness remains darkened and the horizon of truthfulness and faithfulness is seen to be dust-laden. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to raise up souls through whose religiosity, trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness the world may be adorned and illumined. This is not difficult for God. And assuredly that soul who committed treachery shall receive the recompense of his deeds. Last year in these parts similar incidents occurred where some, claiming faith and knowledge and love and affection, afterward stole the belongings of the emigrants and seekers and chose to flee. He said: \"Believe not what thou hearest, and trust not him who showeth submission.\"\n\nMany are the souls who have made humility, submissiveness and sweet words their snare. We beseech God to purify and cleanse the earth from evil and wicked souls. These afflictions that have befallen you, since they were in God's path, will surely yield universal fruits and you shall attain their recompense.\n\nYou mentioned Mukhtaru'l-Mulk. This was presented, and He said: \"God willing, may they be blessed with divine favors.\" We beseech God to assist those who have turned to Him in rending all veils. It is most difficult for a soul to arise with Abrahamic might and power and shatter the idols of the polytheists with the arm of power. For years people have been nurtured on suppositions and vain imaginings, having never inhaled a fragrance from the rose-garden of certitude. Yet in any case one must not despair, nor be heedless of teaching the Cause with wisdom and utterance. One must speak for God's sake and summon unto God, that perchance the children of the age may mature through the milk of the knowledge of the free and gaze upon the Most Great Scene.\n\nThe petition of Mulla Shah-Rida was presented and an answer was revealed from the heaven of grace and sent. Likewise the Captain's petition was presented at the Most Holy Court and its answer was graciously given and sent. Also three most wonderful and most holy Tablets were sent without names from the horizon of grace - they may bestow them upon whomsoever they deem advisable.\n\nConcerning what was written about the news, the matter is as before, as was revealed in the Suriy-i-Ra'is and other Tablets. After all the assemblies and reconciliations, the dust of contention remains aloft and the fire of hatred still blazes. The Ottoman territories are in upheaval, with tumult arising from every corner. However, a prayer hath been revealed from the heaven of grace on behalf of the government, and the friends have been commanded to recite it. After this manifestation of grace, there is hope that some measure of relief may yet be obtained. The Command is in His hands; He doeth as He willeth. The world is in turmoil, and no soul hath comprehended its cause and reason. They have prevented the true Physician from healing these ailments, while they themselves know neither the malady nor its cure. Glory be to God! What heedlessness hath seized them all - they have forsaken the ocean of divine meanings and turned to the salt and bitter pools. Though the Sun of knowledge shineth from the horizon of heaven, they have nonetheless clung to and sought after the ignorant ones of the earth. What regret and remorse! Thus it is that each day they are afflicted with fresh trials and are tormented with grievous punishment. Here do I end My words: Verily, there is no God but Him. He hath ever been supreme over all things and will ever remain transcendent above the mention of all names. None hath befittingly described Him. He is the Sanctified, the Holy, the Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you, who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness and have attained unto this wondrous Cause.\n\nDhi'l-Qa'dih 1295\n\n=== END BH00736 ===\n\n=== START BH00737 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great!\n\nThis is a mention from Us to him who hath inhaled the fragrance of the Garment and turned towards the court of God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as the Most High Pen hath raised thy mention between earth and heaven, and the Tongue of the Wronged One addresseth thee whilst He was in the hands of the oppressors. Give thanks for having been aided to turn towards Him when the Manifestation of thy Lord's Cause, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, appeared with a Command that caused all who are in the heavens and on earth to tremble, save those who came unto God with illumined hearts. There hath been ordained for thee in thy Lord's Kingdom that which shall bring solace to all eyes and gladden the hearts of them that know. Preserve this station, then aid thy Lord, and be not of them that tarry. Patience is praiseworthy except in His Cause - thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of One mighty and wise. That which God showed thee in thy dream is indeed His supreme token unto thee and His most great favor for thee. Be thankful for what He hath bestowed upon thee - ere long shall the effects of this bounty be made manifest. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He giveth what He willeth to whom He willeth and ordaineth by His command what He desireth. Can any prevent His command? Nay, by His sovereignty that prevaileth over the worlds! Can His wisdom ever be exhausted? Nay, by His Word that shineth forth from the horizon of utterance! Yet the people are in profound slumber. Soon shall they awaken, but shall find no escape for themselves. Blessed art thou for having recognized these days and cast aside mankind, turning unto God, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Hold fast unto the handle of the Cause with utmost steadfastness, and associate with those in whose hearts thou findest the sweet fragrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and on whose faces thou beholdest the radiance of joy. They who act according to that which they are commanded are verily among the people of Paradise in the estimation of thy Lord, while they who are heedless are in a mighty veil. O joy be unto him who hath rent asunder the veils, detached from all else but God, and stood firm in this Cause whereby the feet of the doubters have slipped.\n\nSay: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for the loftiness of Thy gifts and favors, and the sublimity of Thy care and bounties, whereby Thou hast aided me to turn towards the Dayspring of the light of Thy oneness and the Repository of the manifestations of Thy transcendent unity. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy names and the Dayspring of Thy signs unto all who are in earth and heaven, to make me steadfast in Thy love, moved by Thy will, speaking Thy praise, gazing towards Thy direction, and content with what Thou hast ordained through Thy decree. O my Lord! I have turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Ordain for me that which befitteth the glory of Thy station and the sublimity of Thy bounties. Then write down for me that whereby my mention shall endure among Thy servants and my spirit in the worlds which Thou hast concealed from Thy creatures. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou pleasest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised. And praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!\n\nIn the name of the Adored One of the worlds.\n\nPraised be God that in this divine springtime thou hast been favored with the outpourings from the clouds of heavenly grace, hast inhaled the sweet fragrances of the garment of divine unity, and hast hearkened unto the notes of the celestial Dove. It behooveth thee to render thanks unto Him at all times. Observe how many are the claimants to knowledge, virtue, wealth, affluence, piety and godliness who have remained deprived of the ultimate purpose and the source of divine bounties, despite the fact that they utter His Name night and day and make mention of Him. Fie upon them! They have cast away that for which they were created and have taken that which they were forbidden in the Tablets of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto the lights of His countenance. This is through God's grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. But today steadfastness is most beloved and is accounted as one of the most great affairs in the sight of God. This exalted station hath ever been and shall forever be. As thou canst observe, certain souls have been kept back from the Sovereign of existence by the vain imaginings of the past, whilst these are days wherein all must detach themselves from whatsoever they possess and, with hearts sanctified from all idle fancies, turn towards the Best-Beloved of the worlds. It is most evident that whatsoever the people possessed hath been but vain imagination, as hath now been made clear to some. Thou shouldst gather, as much as possible, the Persian Tablets that have been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will and read them, for in all of them are revealed mighty utterances and sovereign declarations which shall be the cause of the steadfastness of souls. Blessed is he who gathereth them, readeth them, and delighteth in their contents. We testify that he is of the sincere ones. God willing, thou shouldst remain steadfast in the Cause of God with utmost constancy, and move and speak with wisdom amongst the peoples of the world. He is verily the True Counsellor, the Trustworthy. We beseech God to assist thee in His service and draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nThat which was observed in the dream has come to pass, and it is indeed a manifest truth. This is evidence of God's gifts and bounties bestowed upon you, that you beheld yourself attaining His presence in a spacious place containing many chambers. From time immemorial and unto eternity, the Truth has been and ever shall be in the most exalted and expansive station, and likewise His loved ones--those souls who are sanctified from the doubts and allusions of the veiled ones. Though outwardly they may be seen in prison, in reality they dwell in the highest chambers of paradise, as hath been revealed in the Tablets. When you found yourself in that praiseworthy station, it behooveth you to thank God, your Lord, for having made you among those who circle round Him and attain His presence. This is the supreme bounty, that before the outward meeting, He hath inwardly reckoned you among those near to Him and who have attained His presence. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nThat you inquired in that sublime and inaccessible station about Aqa Muhammad-Javad, upon him be the glory of God, concerning the bestowal of divine bounty upon you, is evidence that he was among the means of divine confirmation and spoke to you with truth and sincerity. Be friendly with him and be among those who remember. That you expressed insufficiency is evidence of your increased seeking from the treasury of grace. Yea, those who seek the Ka'bah of the All-Merciful and circle round the sanctuary of the All-Glorious are like fish in the ocean--the more they drink, the more they cry out \"Is there more?\"\n\nThat the bestowal of bounty was mentioned fourfold indicates that multiple bounties have been ordained for you: the bounty of remembrance now flowing from the Pen, the inner bounty stored in the treasuries of knowledge, likewise the hidden bounty concealed in the repositories of power, and the outward bounty inscribed in the heaven of divine command. God willing, you shall attain them all. This is not difficult for God. Be assured of God's grace to such degree that should all on earth gather to oppose and object, you would see them as absolute nothingness.\n\nAs for your request that this be written in ink, verily We promised you this. By My life, this is indeed the Most Exalted Pen, whose scratching is heard between the heavens and the earth. Thus doth it remember thee in truth, and this cannot be equaled by aught that hath been or shall be created. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Perfect bounty hath been shown unto you; God willing, its effects shall become manifest. Preserve this station lest anything impede it. Thus doth this Wronged One remember thee while seated in prison, detached from all the worlds. Drink forever from the Kawthar of the gifts of the Exalted Lord. That which will assure thee of thy Lord's grace hath been sent down unto thee, and there shall soon be revealed that which shall cause the fragrances of thy Lord to waft abroad. He is the Protector of those who turn unto Him. We beseech God to preserve thee from those who speak of that which they comprehend not and imagine they do well, though they have not understood what is with their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00737 ===\n\n=== START BH00738 ===\n\nGod is Supreme in His Glory and Power\n\nGlorified be God, exalted be His majesty, universal His bounty, mighty His power, and great His dominion! At times He bestows reunion, at times He afflicts with separation. Through nearness and union He gives life, and through remoteness and separation He causes death. What need then of Azrael, when this separation and remoteness is sufficient poison for the heart? Indeed, what wondrous power lies concealed in these hosts! Verily it has and shall ever surpass the power of the world. According to what is heard, His Holiness the Prophet (may our souls be a sacrifice for His sake) was fond of jest. Therefore if anything of this nature appears from these servants in such contexts, there is no harm in it.\n\nPraise, sanctified from reality and metaphor, befits the Self-Sufficient Lord Who, through His Most Exalted Word, has bestowed infinite love between the hearts and souls of His friends and established spiritual unity. No blessing has been or is greater than this blessing. Every knowledgeable one bears witness and every informed one testifies. However, this blessing has been and is exclusive to the friends of Truth. The people of metaphor have no awareness of this mystery and no share in this blessing.\n\nHe created the servants with perfect power, sent Messengers, revealed Books, that all might find the path of truth and sincerity, love and faithfulness, and live in this world by these fruits which are in truth the fruits of the soul. The Exalted Truth, glorified be His majesty, is worthy of a hundred thousand thousand worlds of praise and glorification at every moment - though not by these tongues nor by these perceptions.\n\nAnd blessings and peace be upon His Beloved and Chosen One, the Dawning-Place of His names and the Manifestation of His attributes and the Source of His Cause, through Whom His mysteries and the meanings of His Books and the symbols of His Messengers were revealed, and upon His family and companions through whom the decree of the word \"there is no God but Him\" was established and the banner of power was raised among the righteous ones.\n\nAnd then, O beloved of my heart, the letter arrived - a clear writing in the eyes of those possessed of vision. Nothing was found therein save degrees of yearning and longing, love and unity. In truth, all of it concluded with the blessed word \"Verily, we are God's.\" After hearing the melodies of the nightingales of meanings and utterance, and witnessing the symbols of the mysteries of wisdom and exposition, it was taken to the station and presented before His presence. The Master (may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him) said:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed\n\nThou hast ever been and art remembered before the Wronged One. We beseech God to manifest through thee that which will draw people near unto Him. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. And We beseech Him by His Prophets and His chosen ones to protect thee by His protection and guard thee by His guardianship, and to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the Lord of the throne and the earth.\n\nWe have ever mentioned and continue to mention the friends, and counsel them with that which will elevate the stations of man. We hope that the trees of existence may, through the rain of divine mercy, become adorned with delicate, gathered fruits. The fruits of the Tree of existence have been and are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Blessed is the soul that turns from what the people possess to what God possesses - such a one is accounted among those who have turned to Him in the Perspicuous Book. This Wronged One conveys greetings to each one and seeks for each that which is everlasting and eternal.\n\nPraise be to God! The purpose hath been attained, and Divine favors have become manifest and evident. At all times I have beseeched and do now beseech the Self-Sufficient Lord to grant us the grace to do that which pleaseth Him. All that you wrote was fitting and true - indeed they were words imbued with reality, meaning, strength and purity. Today in certain cities where one or two of the friends reside, the radiance of submission and contentment must shine forth from their countenances. It is hoped that through the endeavors of that beloved of hearts, the unworthy thorns of self and desire will be consumed by the fire of that beloved one's counsels and exhortations, so that in the realm of fancy certainty may prevail, and in the abode of tyranny justice may find its dwelling place. This is not difficult for God to achieve.\n\nPraise be to God! The spiritual beloved, the honored Shaykh, upon him be God's peace and favors, has ever been engaged in service through God's grace and has spoken words of praise and glorification. The glances of divine favor have been and continue to be directed towards him. In these days Aqa Ahmad, son of his eminence the departed and exalted one, upon them both be the Glory of God, sent a letter wherein he mentioned his transactions in the Sublime Porte, and likewise wrote to His Holiness the Name of Bounty. They stated that there is no blame upon the honored Shaykh, as this transaction was done with his knowledge and was sent to Mirza Mihdi in Tabriz. The Shaykh was in no way at fault in this matter. Mirza Mihdi must fulfill his obligation and send the funds. At most, the honored Shaykh, out of love, assisted him in the transaction and offered help - this is cause for gratitude, not complaint.\n\nFrom all these utterances the fragrances of grace waft. Praise be to God! They have regarded and continue to regard the station of His loved ones. And then the letter of the honored Shaykh himself - upon him be the Glory of God - arrived, and it became clear that for him it yielded naught but trouble. There is no doubt that the bearing of these burdens was for the sake of God. The reward for these deeds rests with God. We beseech Him to protect His loved ones and to sanctify them from the doubts, insinuations and calumnies of His servants. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nThis servant conveyeth greetings to each of the friends and seeketh for each that which is befitting.\n\nThey mentioned the feast of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the peace of God. After presenting it, they said: \"Excellent is what he hath done! Blessed is he who hath honored thy dwelling place.\" I beseech God to illumine that land through the goodly deeds and praiseworthy character of His loved ones, that all may bear witness to their detachment, trustworthiness, truthfulness and refinement of soul. This servant hath ever beseeched this from the heaven of bounty of the Lord of existence, in the nights and days, and it will assuredly be answered, for He hath promised: \"Call upon Me and I shall answer you.\" He is the All-Forgiving, He is the All-Merciful, He is the All-Hearing, He is the Answerer. The affairs there have surely by now been uncovered and become known, so that it may be evident to every soul that which they had imagined without proof. Here the Afnan all testify to the trustworthiness, religiosity, mercy and kindness of the beloved Shaykh, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. Some time ago this servant wrote and sent a letter to the honored brother Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. It has surely arrived. I beseech God that complete affection and complete unity may appear between them in such wise as to cause all to wonder. This matter was heard from the tongue of the Desired One. In any case, this servant ever hopes for that which is the cause of loftiness, exaltation, glory, and bounty. This hope hath not been and will not be cut off. After Divine grace, until now, whatsoever we have beseeched from the heaven of generosity and sea of bounty, He hath granted. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous, and He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Peace and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00738 ===\n\n=== START BH00739 ===\n\nThe Tablet of the Cloud, revealed by God, the Lord of all men\n\nIn the Name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise\n\nThis is a Book from the All-Merciful to those who have turned towards the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth, that the verses of God may gladden them, draw them to the horizon of Revelation, and bring them near to the station wherein all things proclaim: \"There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\" Arise to serve the Cause through God's might and power. Say: O people of the Bayan! Remember the favor of God unto you when ye were on the brink of the abyss of forgetfulness, and He sent down to you from the heaven of exposition that which taught you this clear and straight Path.\n\nO Ancient Pen! Make mention in the Tablet of that which may bring joy to the hearts of the sincere ones and assure every person of insight that I am, verily, powerful over whatsoever I desire. None on earth can prevent Me from that which I will, and I am the Mighty, the Wise. Say: The idolaters have violated God's covenant and His testament, and have imprisoned Us with manifest injustice. When We arrived, We desired to convey unto the kings the messages of God, the Mighty, the Great, the Supreme. Among them was the King of Persia, to whom We unveiled the beauty of the Cause and made Ourselves known, after We had chosen one from among the distinguished ones, breathed into his heart the spirit of might and power, and sent him unto him like a ball of fire with a Tablet from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Therein We explained what his hands had wrought and what the King of Rome had perpetrated, that they might know that tribulation would never prevent the Glory (Baha) from what the Lord of Names had willed, and that the might of those who had denied God, the Mighty, the Praised, would never frighten Us.\n\nThereby did We sound the trumpet of might once again, whereat every stubborn tyrant was shaken. Therein We sent down such counsels and admonitions as would awaken the hearts of those who slumber. We have revealed therein a clear explanation of every matter. Blessed is he who readeth it and pondereth its allusions. By My life! A single word therefrom would suffice all mankind; were it to descend upon the mountains, they would soar with longing toward God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We desired naught from him save the manifestation of God's sovereignty and grandeur, the spreading of His Cause, and the demonstration of His independence among His doubting servants. We left therein no excuse for anyone. Read thou and be of the thankful.\n\nSay: O peoples of the earth! Consider how We revealed in the Tablet to your leader that he should gather Us together with the learned men of the age that God's Cause and His proof might be made manifest unto you. He committed that which caused the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament. After this, to what will ye cling and to whom will ye turn? Be fair and be not of the wrongdoers. Likewise did We desire in Iraq to meet with the divines of Persia. When they heard of it, they fled and said: \"This is naught but a manifest sorcerer.\" These are words that issued forth from the mouths of their like before, and these people objected to them for what they said, yet today they speak the same words and understand not. By My life! They are like ashes in the sight of thy Lord; when He willeth, tempestuous winds pass over them and render them as dust. Verily, thy Lord is powerful over what He willeth.\n\nThose lands were honored by the advent of their Chosen Lord, and every stone and clod did speak. The forelock of days hath appeared and the Desired One hath come with manifest glory. The land of Hijaz was seized with trembling and stirred by the breeze of reunion, saying: \"O my Lord, the Most High! Praise be unto Thee for having brought me to life through the fragrances of Thy reunion after I had been slain by Thy separation. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Thee, and woe unto the heedless ones.\" Mount Sinai hath been illumined \\[...\\]\n\nThat land where We raised up the Prophets and Messengers has been illumined with the radiance of the Manifestation. He said: \"I have discovered Thy sweet savour, O my God, Who art in the heavens and the earth!\" Therein was raised the call of the Friend, then of Him Who conversed with God, and afterwards of the Son. All informed and gave glad tidings to the servants concerning this momentous announcement and His advent in those regions. Thus was it sent down in the Tablets from the presence of an ancient Lord.\n\nThe Tree calleth out: \"O people of the realm below! The Lord of the Kingdom is come and hath mounted the throne, surrounded by His near angels. Abandon churches and mosques; hasten to the Dayspring of Revelation and follow not the imaginings of the heedless. By God! The Dawn of Certitude hath broken. The temples are for His remembrance - He Who is remembered hath come with great sovereignty. Beware lest remembrances hold you back from your Chosen Lord. Cast aside what the people possess, then turn to the Source of inspiration. This is better for you, did ye but know it.\"\n\nArise to make mention of Me. Let not the words of the idolaters deter thee. The tongue was created to mention the All-Merciful. Remind the people, but with wisdom. Thus hath the matter been decreed and inscribed by the Pen of thy Lord's will, the All-Knowing, the Powerful.\n\nGather My loved ones and command them from Us to righteousness and piety. Thus art thou commanded by thy Most Glorious Lord, and for thee is today with Us an honoured station.\n\nThose who obstruct the path, consume people's wealth, and spread corruption in the land - I am quit of them, and God is witness to what I say. By My life! My imprisonment is not My abasement - it is glory for Me. Rather, abasement lies in the deeds of My loved ones who claim attachment to Us yet follow Satan in their actions. They are assuredly among the losers.\n\nWhen the Cause was fulfilled and the Luminary of the horizons shone forth from the direction of Iraq, We commanded them to that which would sanctify them from all peoples. Some were seized by desire and turned away from what was commanded, while others followed the truth with guidance and were of the guided ones.\n\nSay: Those who commit indecency and cling to the world are not of the people of Baha. They are souls who, should they pass through a valley of gold, would pass it by as passing clouds, never turning toward it. They are indeed of Me - the Concourse on High would surely find from their garments the fragrance of sanctity. Thy Lord beareth witness to this, as do those endowed with knowledge of the Book. Were the most beautiful women to appear before them in their finest adornment, their eyes would not turn toward them with desire. These are they who were created from piety. Thus doth the Ancient Pen teach you from your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO thou who hast turned! Deliver the messages of thy Lord, that perchance people might abandon desire and take up what they are commanded by God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Say: Waste not God's Cause among you, and follow not those who have denied God, the Sender of the winds. Aid God with your tongues, for the tongue is the sword of the All-Merciful. Open therewith the cities of hearts. This is the station of man - know this, O ye who are endued with insight.\n\nSay: O concourse of divines! Can any one of you race with the Divine Youth in the arena of wisdom and utterance, or soar with Him to the heaven of inner meanings and explanation? Nay, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All are struck dumb this day by the Word of thy Lord. They are as dead, not alive, except those whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Unconstrained, willeth. He, verily, is of those endowed with knowledge in the estimation of the All-Knowing. Upon him shall the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the sanctified retreats pray at eventide and at dawn. Can he whose legs are made of wood withstand him whose legs God hath made of iron? Nay, by Him Who illumineth the horizons! They who have violated the Covenant of God and His Testament, these are they whom the breaths of punishment have overtaken. They shall soon behold their habitations in the fire. How wretched the abode of every arrogant oppressor! Say: O people! Consider the generations that have passed before you. We sent unto them Messengers; they denied the signs of their Lord. We seized them for their sins and left them as a warning unto men of understanding. Where are they who reclined upon cushions of vain glory in their palaces? We have returned them to their graves. Those houses they left to the spider. Take ye warning, O ye who are endowed with discernment! Say: Awaken, O people! The Herald hath cried out in the wilderness of the Bayan, and this is the Day of the great calling. How long will ye slumber on the couch of heedlessness and desire? Arise and turn unto God, and follow not every doubting idolater. We have, aforetime, revealed unto thee clear verses. These, once again, We have sent down as a token of Our grace. We, verily, are the Mighty, the Forgiving. That thou mayest arise to serve God and praise Him at morn and eventide. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them unto thee. Thy Lord, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\n=== END BH00739 ===\n\n=== START BH00740 ===\n\nLet His Honor the Afnan, the most esteemed Mr. Aqay-i-Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be all the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, take note.\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nThis is a day wherein voices have been raised and pleasures transformed. It is as though earth and heaven have been turned to fire, and from the cannon balls there hath appeared that which causeth bodies to quake at its mention. From the sea riseth the rumbling of artillery, and upon land raineth down bullets from rifles. Come ye, come ye, O people of the world, that I may show you the manifestations of might and power, and the conditions of glory and grandeur. By God! The deeds of creation have been embodied by the command of the Truth, appearing at times in the form of fire, and at others in the form of smoke, and from these have earthquakes seized the tribes and parties. O people of the earth, come ye, come ye! The Servant desireth to ask of you one word - tell Me truthfully: Is there among you one possessed of sight and heart who might observe and ponder what hath befallen the lands from the cannons of aggression? Is there among you any fair-minded one who might judge what hath appeared in the contingent world? Is there any with ears to hear what hath been sent down of mysteries and tidings in the Book? The Servant testifieth that He calleth unto the world with the greatest love and supreme compassion, yet the people turn not unto Him nor hear from Him, as though the intoxication of the cup of wrath hath seized them and prevented them from mercy, rest and tranquility. We are God's and unto Him shall we return.\n\nIn these days, some of what flowed from the Supreme Pen in God's Book hath become manifest and evident. Alexandria, which was adorned with the utmost ornaments and known for its wealth, might and riches, was in but a few hours observed to be impoverished, destitute and naked. Fiery shells rained down upon it from the wicked. Every ignorant one is bewildered and stunned, and every wise one thoughtful and warned. Pride and turning away have become the cause and reason for negligence, for had they acted according to what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an, they would have ever been observed beneath the glances of His favor. The portion of the rebellious and transgressing ones shall surely come. The flame of fire is visible, yet its source is not known. Those with true vision in the world are as rare as red sulfur - nay, rarer still. Strange that no one is aware and not a soul perceives. How many souls in these parts have witnessed and heard what was revealed before, yet still they are seen to be heedless. In truth, the Greatest Talisman is manifest. The Servant beseecheth His Lord to have mercy on His servants, to guide them to His path, and to give them to drink from the Kawthar of His utterance. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nIn one of the blessed Surihs revealed at the beginning of His arrival in the Most Great Prison, He - exalted be His glory - saith: \"Know thou that God hath seized the greatest of those who passed judgment against Us, through His power and sovereignty,\" unto His words, exalted be His majesty: \"Soon shall We depose one like unto him and seize their prince who ruleth over the lands, and I am the Mighty, the Compelling.\" How many souls did He seize through one of the greatest of the wicked ones, rewarding them according to their deeds, and then caused him to perish and be destroyed by the flame of His wrath, until he returned to his abode. The Command is in His hand. He seeth and knoweth what He doeth. None may object to Him. He is ever wakeful and watchful, while others are heedless and sleeping. The Servant asketh Him, through His own tongue and the tongues of the world, to forgive them and us for what we have wrought in His days and to forgive our transgressions. Verily, He is our Master, our Lord, our God, our Goal, our Beloved, our Worshipped One, and the Worshipped One of all who are in the heavens and earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!\n\nO offspring of the heart of the Messenger and branch of the Divine Lote-Tree! My spirit and my soul be a sacrifice for your love, for your acceptance, and for your steadfastness! Days and nights have passed, and the servant has not heard your melodies upon the Tree, nor your songs upon the Branch. Though the servant has sins greater than mountains, yet this servant has a true and acceptable excuse before your presence, for correspondence has occupied me and affairs have prevented me. Tasks have multiplied and opportunity has diminished, and time is more precious than costly pearls - to this beareth witness the Lord of the world and the Goal of nations.\n\nI submit that heedlessness hath overtaken this evanescent one, for my remembrance and consciousness are as heedlessness itself, nay greater - how much more so my heedlessness! I seek forgiveness from God, the Most Great, for every mention and deed. Until one day the Intended One said that a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet had been revealed specially for the Afnan, upon him be His glory. \"Write something too and inquire that he might write about all matters concerning the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be His glory, of every kind, and submit them to the Most Holy Court. O Afnan! For some time you have concealed the affairs of the Most Exalted Leaf and have not submitted them. You must surely write and present them. Ye are beneath the domes of My glory, the pavilion of My grace, and the canopy of My grandeur.\" Thus ended His words, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specially for him and sent. His Holiness sent it and said: \"O Afnan! Be not grieved by what has occurred. Soon thou shalt see and know what was hidden in God's knowledge. Verily thy Lord has aided thee and will aid thee as He pleaseth. He is indeed the All-Conquering, the Almighty.\"\n\nI further submit that my nothingness and evanescence be conveyed to the presence of the honored teacher, upon him be all the most glorious glory of the All-Glorious, and likewise to the honored Afnans, upon them be all the most glorious glory of the All-Glorious. This evanescent servant expresses his nothingness and evanescence, and begs of God that each may be seen as a banner upon the highest standards of the world. Though by God's grace they had already attained, and still maintain, this most exalted station before this servant's submission, they have won mention that neither extinction can touch nor centuries and ages can alter. This servant has always intended to submit to your presence words demonstrating true sincerity, but until now has not succeeded. In truth, he expresses shame before all and seeks pure pardon for God's sake, for opportunity and time are like rest, and in these days do not exist in the world of being. All the chosen ones of God bear witness to the magnitude of this evanescent one's task, and from all it is expected that they beseech God to strengthen this evanescent one that he might perhaps fulfill that with which he has been charged. Verily, He has power over whatsoever He willeth. May the Glory that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the providence of our and your Goal be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO God of Names and Creator of Heaven! Thou seest Thy branches and what they seek in Thy love and Thy good-pleasure. Among them are those who have clung to the cord of Thy grace, and those who have held fast to the hem of Thy mercy, and those who yearned to attain Thy presence and have been blessed with Thy bounty, and those who have left their homelands out of longing to visit Thy countenance. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Eternity and Sovereign of Nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist them in that which they seek in Thy love and Thy path. Then grant them the cup of Thy presence and the chalice of reunion with Thee, and draw them nigh unto Thee that their eyes may be gladdened and their faces illumined thereby. O Lord! I beseech Thee to place them beneath the shadow of Thy providence and to ordain for them the good that lay hidden in Thy knowledge and the grace that was treasured with Thee. Verily, Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can render powerless. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power that prevaileth over all who are in the heavens and the earth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Hearing, the Answerer, the All-Bountiful.\n\nThe Servant\n\n27 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1299\n\n=== END BH00740 ===\n\n=== START BH00741 ===\n\nMay the honored Afnan, his eminence Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon whom be all glory, be favored by the Most Pure Glance.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden throughout all eternity, and Who hath spoken in praise of His own Self, whereupon the sincere ones were drawn unto the court of nearness, sanctity and beauty, and the Baha'is unto a station whereof the pens are powerless to make mention and which no utterance can describe. Exalted is He Who hath subdued all things through the movement of His Most Exalted Pen and established the Cause upon foundations that cannot be shaken by the winds of discord from those who have denied God, the Lord of the future and the past. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the bounty of our Most Glorious Lord be upon the Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree who have quaffed the choice wine from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Lord of all names, and upon those who have cast away their idle fancies and held fast unto the Sure Handle which hath appeared between earth and heaven through a mighty will that was not hindered by the power of the wretched ones who turned away from the Kingdom of immortality and set their faces toward that which perisheth. We beseech God, our Lord and the Lord of all that hath been created between earth and heaven, to aid all to recognize Him and to turn unto that which shall profit them in the worlds of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious.\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice for the fragrant breaths of your pen! By the life of God, this servant has found in your utterance that which brings solace to the eye of every mystic, raises up every seated one, gives voice to every tongue-tied one, brings hearing to every deaf one, and draws nigh every far and near one, for it has wafted from the garden of God's Name and His love, God's remembrance and His affection, God's praise and His grandeur. Glorious be His mention, He has said in one place: \"Blessed is the pen that moves in remembrance and praise of Me, blessed the eye that has turned to the Dawning-Place of My grace and the Dayspring of My lights, blessed the tongue that has testified to that which My tongue has testified, blessed the heart that has won My love, blessed the hand that has taken the Book of My commandments and ordinances, blessed the feet that have passed beyond this world and stood firm upon My path, and blessed the soul that has drunk the Kawthar of steadfastness in My Cause.\" Thus has My tongue spoken in the kingdom of My utterance, that every heart may rejoice on this glorious and wondrous Day.\n\nIn truth, this evanescent servant has derived the utmost joy, delight and gladness from your noble letter, for every word thereof indicated your contentment, your submission, and your recognition. How beautiful is this word that has flowed from your pen where you wrote: \"whatsoever has been and shall be decreed and ordained and executed and shall be executed is best for His loved ones and chosen ones, better than the kingdom of the heavens and earth, for He knoweth them better than they know themselves. Would that the world might know what lieth concealed behind the veils of the Manifestation, and that the peoples might discover that which is hidden and treasured...\" After these words were presented before the Most Holy Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these blessed words: \"O servant! If people were to observe and act upon that which hath been recorded in these few lines from the pen of the Afnan, upon him be My glory, all would find themselves independent of all else save God and would recline upon the couches of joy, expansiveness and tranquility. O servant! If a soul were to reflect even slightly and hold fast with perfect steadfastness to the handle of the Cause, he would surely know that no station would pass him by, and he would attain unto such bounties as the understanding of those possessed of understanding cannot ascend to, and the recognition of the mystics would find itself powerless before it. And after attaining this most exalted station, the sorrows and troubles of the world would no longer grieve him. Blessed be the Afnan who hath spoken that from which the fragrance of divine knowledge hath been wafted among all created things. By My life! He hath spoken as befitteth him. We make mention of him, and have mentioned him before, time and again, as though he were standing before the gate morning and evening.\"\n\nO beloved of my heart! This servant is at every moment immersed in the ocean of wonderment, for he observes that the lights of the Manifestation have encompassed the world and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth have taken hold of the entire earth; nevertheless, all are either asleep on the couch of heedlessness or wandering in the desert of ignorance, save whom my Lord willeth. A hundred thousand regrets that souls are deprived of the ocean of joy! I beseech Him, exalted be His dominion, to adorn all the peoples of the world with the garments of forgiveness and grant them all awareness of that which He hath revealed in the Book as it ought to be, for if they become aware, by God besides Whom there is none other God, they would pass beyond themselves and the world and would arise as beseemeth this Day.\n\nHe is the One Who moves in the world!\n\nO Afnan! The servant present has read that wherewith thou didst commune with thy wronged, exiled Lord, Who summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We have heard that which thy tongue hath uttered and that which thy pen hath set in motion, and We have witnessed the turning of thy heart and thine eye and ear unto Him, unto His beauty and His call raised at all times. By Him Who hath made the Most Great Prison the seat of His throne! Were the world to discover but a drop from the ocean of My grace, they would surely cast aside all else and take to My straight path.\n\nO Afnan! Although all people at all times witness the passing away of the earth and whatsoever is therein, yet they cleave unto it and turn away from the immortal Kingdom. How many are the houses from which joyous melodies were raised at night, yet in the morning lamentations and wailing were heard therefrom. How many occasions of joy and pleasure and delight were in an instant transformed into mourning, and how many ornaments and bounties from which their possessor was deprived. And all people, heedless though they be, have witnessed and continue to witness all these things, yet they remain veiled, heedless and turned aside. The sweet ocean is manifest and surging before their eyes, yet all are occupied with the bitter, briny pool.\n\nPraise be to God that the warmth of divine love is evident and manifest from thy tongue, heart and limbs. By the life of the Beloved! A hundred thousand worlds cannot equal this station. Were the capacity of the world to allow it, the fruits of deeds would become manifest. God willing, may they ever be the recipients of the special favors of the Lord and be occupied with His remembrance and be gladdened thereby. Convey My greetings to all those who have drunk from the Kawthar of utterance and are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful, and gladden them with the mention of God.\n\n=== END BH00741 ===\n\n=== START BH00742 ===\n\nHe is the Revealer without delay and the Sender without hindrance. Never have the eyes of creation witnessed any cessation in the wonders of His bounty, and thus hath His mercy preceded all mankind.\n\nO Nabil! We have sent thee a Tablet, and before it a Book, and before that Sacred Writings, and before that Scriptures, a single letter of which was the most weighty burden between heaven and earth and the mightiest spirit for those in the kingdom of command and creation. Yet We found not from thee the fragrance of true knowledge, and this beseemeth thee not if thou art to be fair in thine own self. Reflect upon that which hath been sent down unto thee from the cloud of mighty mercy. We commanded thee aforetime to cast behind thee all mention, then to contemplate those who have gone before, and to gaze toward the direction of the Cause with the vision of thy Lord, and to be among those who observe what is inscribed in the Mother Book. Purify thyself in such wise that the word of none shall affect thee, nor shall the indication of any indicator trouble thee. Witness with the eye of certitude that which hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord's might, and be illumined with clear vision.\n\nIf thou wouldst hear what We have commanded thee, the truth would become manifest unto thee in less than a moment. Thou wouldst witness the dawning of the Sun from the holy horizon, would fall prostrate upon thy face before thy Lord, and wouldst be well-pleased in the religion of God. Therefore, hear My words and forget not God's favor upon thee, and deprive not thyself of the sacred sanctuary. Then look with primary vision upon that which was revealed unto the Prophets and Messengers, that the Sun of certitude might shine upon thee from a holy and mighty horizon.\n\nWouldst thou wish to be like those who came before? By My life, this beseemeth thee not! Therefore, take for thyself beneath the shade of thy Lord a station that is faithful to the truth. When the Sun of Words dawneth upon thee from the horizon of the Kawthar of thy Lord's mercy, be illumined by its light and deprive not thyself of the wondrous bounties. Follow God's ways and His command - this is My love, shouldst thou turn thy vision to all the Tablets. Thus doth the Tongue of God speak at the time when He was established upon the throne of a mighty name.\n\nSay: The days have dawned from the horizon of this Day, and the mornings have broken forth from this Dayspring which hath been witnessed from the holy horizon. Deprive not thyself of thy portion of the bounty of that Day. Then observe how the Tree of Fire is ignited and illumined upon a spot of light, and all in the kingdom cry out with a mighty and glorious call. When We answered thee before, We withheld not the Pen from thy mention, that perchance thou mightest take for thyself, near the remembrance of thy Lord, a station that was wondrous in truth. If thou payest no heed to what We have sent thee, We shall remind thee until thou art turned from the direction of remoteness and established in a holy station near at hand.\n\nAs for those who have denied God's signs, by what proof did they believe in the Manifestations of the past? Say: Bring forth your proof, O concourse of the earth! Nay, by My life, they have neither proof nor evidence, and to this testify the tongues of all created things, and beyond them thy Lord was witness to that. By God, O Nabil, I speak not from desire. If thou wouldst but purify thy sight, thou wouldst witness that the Spirit speaketh above My head and calleth out in the loudest voice: \"By God, this is the Beloved of the mystics!\" Woe unto the soul that hath turned away from His beauty and been veiled from the presence of its Lord. Say: O people of the Bayan! Reflect within yourselves for a moment, then be fair \\[...\\]\n\nO people! If you deny God and His signs, then be ashamed within yourselves and harm Him not with the swords of your imaginings, and be God-fearing in His religion. Say: Do you worship names which you have named and taken as lords for yourselves besides God, while you reject Him by Whose word the names and their kingdoms were created, and Who in truth encompasses all the worlds? Fear God and do not act as did the people of the Furqan. Arise from the couches of heedlessness and take the Book of God with hands of submission, then place it upon your heads. By God, this is better for you than all that exists in the kingdom, were you but to know it.\n\nO Nabil! Would that thou hadst been standing before Us and present in the holy court, that thou mightest hear what no ear of creation hath heard, and witness what no eye of invention hath witnessed, and attain unto that which none in all the realm hath attained. But this hath passed thee by due to the distance between us and what hath been ordained in the preserved tablets. Purify thyself from the allusions that have come between thee and the Lord of Names, then drink the cup of submission from this Beauty Who hath dawned from the horizon of glory. Hearken unto the counsel of one who counseleth thee in truth and seeketh from thee neither recompense nor thanks.\n\nKnow thou that there hath come upon Me that which hath come upon no one before. The servants who were created by My word have pronounced judgment against Me. Thus do We recount unto thee in truth that thou mayest become aware of that which is veiled from the eyes of every heedless one far removed. Come forth from behind the veils in the name of thy Lord, and stand between the heavens and the earth. Fear no one and trust in all matters in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds. Then remind the people of what the Spirit hath inspired in thee, and be not silent in the remembrance of thy Lord. Thus hath the Pen of Command counseled thee before and counseleth thee now through grace, out of love for thyself, that thou mayest remain steadfast upon this path.\n\nSay: By God, this is the path of God between the heavens and earth, His Most Great Throne among the servants, His Manifestation to all in the lands, the Expression of His Essence to those in the kingdoms of Command and Creation, and the Dawning-Place of His Being to those in the realm of might and truth. None comprehendeth it save those possessed of penetrating vision. If thou wert to incline thine ear to all things, thou wouldst hear their lamentations at what hath befallen the Manifestation of God's Self in these days the like of which the eyes of grandeur have never witnessed. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Pen of Wisdom.\n\nIllumine thy heart, then illumine the hearts of the people that the breezes of detachment may waft from thee upon all things, that thy Lord's grace unto thee may be perfected and thou mayest attain unto a mighty love. Beware, beware lest thou cast behind thee the melodies of the Spirit or turn unto those who have denied God's verses after their revelation and who remain veiled behind the veils of their own selves. Taste of the tree and the fruits it hath yielded, and deprive not thyself of what hath been ordained for thee in the realm of exalted glory. By God, none hath any escape save either to deny all the verses or to believe in what hath been sent down in truth from the holy and wondrous clouds. This is thy Lord's mercy which hath descended through grace - and is there in all creation anything more excellent than this? \\[...\\]\n\nThus doth the Tongue of God bear witness at this moment, if thou be of them that hear. Though We desire not to tarry in mentioning the loved ones of God, yet We desire to make mention according to what is possible, lest they pause regarding that which hath been revealed unto them. Otherwise, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, were We to find in any soul the warmth of the love of God, We would assuredly cast upon it, in number as the raindrops, verses of impregnable glory. Nay, We would send down upon such a one in such wise as none can reckon save God and the Manifestations of His Cause. Thus hath it been sent down at this moment from the finger of thy Lord, the Almighty. And the Spirit and the Glory and the splendor be upon thee and upon all who are steadfast in the Cause and stand firm in their love.\n\n=== END BH00742 ===\n\n=== START BH00743 ===\n\nHe is the All-Bountiful, the Possessor of Great Grace\n\nRapture and ecstasy have appeared in the City of Lovers, for a precious gem among gems has sought its mine, and a lover among lovers has outstripped all others and sacrificed himself in the path of the Desire of all worlds. The wolf has devoured, the oppressor has slain, and the serpent has opened its mouth and swallowed. Glory be to God! Deeds that cause wonder to the Concourse on High have no effect upon ignorant servants. The events of the days and the appearance of lights and the manifestation of mysteries are visible before all faces, yet they are seen to be without effect and observed to be fruitless, for rebellion has cut down the tree of worthiness and erased hope from hearts. Until now, the light of the Cause and its grace and essence have not appeared in the being of the servants. Ask thou of God to transform and change this. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful.\n\nUpon thee be the light of God and His mercy, and the glory of God and His favor. The event in the land of Sad was the cause of preventing corruption. When the intention and purpose of the oppressors was not accepted, they arose to tyranny. Thou art witness, and those near to God and the sincere ones bear testimony, that this Wronged One protected those souls through the hosts of exhortations, counsels, wisdom and utterance. However, due to the lack of mention of this supreme favor, it remained concealed, and its concealment is preferable with God to its disclosure. They are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what they do. However, We counsel all the friends to patience and forbearance. All must fix their gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon. Commit all affairs to God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they who put their trust in God, who have relied in all matters upon God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection.\n\nKnow thou with clear certainty that these great oppressions prepare the way for supreme justice. The tyranny of Pharaoh prepared the way for the justice of Moses, and the hand of power brought forth from his house that which he strove with all his might to avoid and whose removal he sought. The power of God is above their power, and the Cause of God is above their commands, and the Will of God is above their wills.\n\nThy letter which thou didst send in the name of Jud was presented before the Wronged One, and whatsoever was mentioned therein was heard. Thou didst seek martyrdom and hast asked about its station from God, exalted be His glory, both before and after. The Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to thy martyrdom. Be grateful to thy Lord for this manifest grace.\n\nThe Supreme Pen testified to the martyrdom of the King of Martyrs before his physical martyrdom, uttering these sublime words: \"Verily the martyr walketh and speaketh and serveth the Cause of his Lord.\" Several years before his ascension, his name was recorded by the Supreme Pen in the register of martyrs. Today, your service and support of the Most Great Cause surpasseth any other deed. Glory be to God! The blind of the world are deprived of sight, and the deaf are forbidden to hear. O thou who speaketh in My name and uttereth My praise! The sheep of God are surrounded by wolves, having had and having no guardian or protector save God. Your honor must act with the utmost wisdom and hold fast to that which is needful in this day. First, in towns and cities where the fire of sedition is ablaze, it is not permissible to turn in that direction. Justice and fairness in Iran have become like the phoenix. For a time His Majesty the King had endeavored to protect the sheep of God. In any case, they have had and continue to have superiority over other servants. His kindness, mercy and favor have had and have no comparison to others. From the land of ?ad they have mentioned and sent forth calumnies. We do not wish to reveal that which is concealed behind the pavilion of knowledge. Second, regarding those friends who are observed to be distressed and fearful in adversity and hardship, no blame resteth upon such souls. How is the state of a bird that beholdeth an eagle, and the condition of a sheep that seeth wolves on all sides? The utmost kindness must be shown to such souls, and even if they commit a wrong deed or utter an unseemly word, one must hold fast to gracious patience and take refuge in the greatest concealment, which is one of the fruits of God's Name, the Concealer. For if someone's oversight is mentioned, it would cause grief and embarrassment to that helpless one, and this is not beloved before God. The condition of this Wronged One is known to all, and His purpose is clear, and never hath He considered, nor doth He consider, the preservation of His own self. In the Tablet to the King, these exalted words were revealed from the Supreme Pen, the meaning of which in Persian is this: This Wronged One is seated beneath a sword suspended by a thread or a hair; it is not known whether it will fall now, or in another hour, or another day. Many times We were imprisoned, and like captives We were paraded through streets and bazaars, and all that befell Us and We bore was for the purpose that all the peoples of the world might be sanctified from rancor and hatred and be illumined with the light of love, fellowship and unity. In any case, in these days it is not permissible to turn towards the lands of Shin and ?ad. The accepted souls - the three and the fourth, upon them be the glory of God - have both friends and enemies. The satans of the earth and its wolves have been and are lying in wait. Therefore, your honor's entry into that land is not advisable. In the land of ?ad, someone from that land must now arise to serve and hold fast to wisdom, illumining hearts and minds with the light of utterance. We beseech God to raise up therein one who will remember Me and aid Me, whom oppression will not deter from justice, nor clamor from steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. In these days it is not permissible to mention the names of the friends at the head of holy Tablets. However, without names, Tablets have been sent written by the two Branches and the servant, and the number of ha by the Greater Branch. We have commanded Jud to mention the details of the bestowal of Tablets.\n\nMention hath been made of Jinab-i-Mirza Mihdi Khan, upon him be the Glory of God. He verily witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Let them be confident in God's grace and assured of His bounty. Praise be to God, from the earliest days they drank from the Kawthar of utterance and received a great portion from the sealed wine. We send greetings and salutations to him and the loved ones of that land, and We give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. In these days their mention hath again been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Should We wish, We would send it as a token of Our grace, for thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Make mention of all the loved ones in those regions on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Be not grieved by the oppression of the oppressors. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make known unto you the stations of those who turned towards Him and responded when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and who drank the wine of steadfastness from this Cup which glorieth over the seas. O Haydar-'Ali, upon thee be My glory! Say: My God, my God! With Thee are the treasuries of sight and hearing. I beseech Thee by Thine eye that sleepeth not, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all created things, and by the ocean of Thy verses and the kingdom of Thine utterance, that Thou deprive not Thy servants of beholding and hearkening. Thou art, verily, the Lord of all men. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the All-Seeing. O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy chosen ones and Thy trusted ones, whom the swords of the world could not frighten, nor could the veils of those who denied the Day of Judgment prevent. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00743 ===\n\n=== START BH00744 ===\n\nThe Book of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting\n\nHe is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed\n\nPraise be to the Self-Subsisting Lord, Who is worthy and deserving, Who through the hands of bounty hath bestowed the choice-sealed wine upon all the peoples of the world. The waves of the ocean of His wrath did not withhold His mercy, and the chains of kings and sovereigns did not prevent the tongue of His grandeur from speech. He is the Speaker of Sinai and the Lord of Revelation Who, through His exalted Word, bestowed new life upon the dwellers of the graves, and engaged them in service. None knoweth them save He Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison before the faces of all nations: \"The King hath come! The Kingdom is God's, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting!\" Glory, radiance, light and splendor be upon the hands of the Cause of God who have aided His Cause throughout all lands and regions. These are servants whom We have made keys to the doors of knowledge and understanding in the contingent world. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath assisted them to arise to serve His firm and mighty Cause.\n\nThe honored Branch hath presented before Me thy letter which thou didst send to the Beloved, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, and he read it before My face. We answer thee with verses whereby all things were attracted and the atoms cried out before all faces: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Choosing!\" Should anyone ask thee about the Glory, say: \"By God's life! He is under the claws of hatred, yet He remembereth His loved ones with that which the fragrance thereof shall never cease to endure, by the perpetuity of God, the Lord of the hidden and the manifest.\" O Fadlu'llah! Hear the call from the horizon of 'Akka - verily there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Blessed art thou for having remembered thy Lord at a time when the factions had surrounded Him from all sides. Say: This is the Day of Victory; aid ye it through remembrance and utterance. Thus hath the All-Merciful decreed in the Scriptures and Tablets. The eyes of the pure ones in the Most Exalted Paradise have wept by reason of that which hath befallen the friends of God in the City of Ya. Thus was the matter decreed from God, the Lord of lords. By God's life! Through this God hath aided His Cause and exalted it to a station beyond which all mention is cut off. Soon shall the sincere ones behold the power of God and His sovereignty. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak as He walked in the palace which God had made the Dayspring of lights.\n\nO 'Ali-Qabli-Muhammad! We have mentioned thee before in a Tablet through which the fragrances of God were wafted to all regions. Thou wert mentioned before the Throne through verses at which feet have slipped save those who were encompassed by the tender mercies of their Lord, the Lord of all men. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to unite through thee the hearts and to strengthen thee in all conditions. Read what We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book and give glad-tidings thereof to My servants who have arisen to serve My Cause, who have soared in My atmosphere, and who have spoken that which the tongue of My grandeur hath spoken from the most exalted station. Say: O people! This is the Day of Teaching. Cast aside what ye possess, clinging to the cord of God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God, Who is supreme over the Sacred Place and the Station.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! The loved ones of the earth and the letter Mim have always been and continue to be before Our sight. No veil separateth between the Wronged One and them. To this beareth witness the Mother Book and beyond it the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O My loved ones! This is the Day of triumph and the Day of utterance. Arise to teach the Cause of God, and in all conditions bestow with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance, from the choice sealed wine which hath been unsealed by the finger of the bounty of the Lord, the Self-Subsisting, that perchance the heedless ones of the world may find their way to the ocean of awareness and arise to render service. O party of God, His loved ones and His chosen ones! Shun ye whatsoever giveth forth the odor of mischief, and adorn yourselves with the ornament of patience and resignation. By the life of God! The recompense of your deeds hath not been, nor shall ever be, lost, but is preserved and treasured with the Trustee. Rejoice ye in this word which no words in the world can equal. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity at this manifest time.\n\nWe wish at this time to make mention of him who was named Javad in the Book of God, which speaketh in the final return. O Javad! That which hath appeared is such as no eye in the world hath seen the like thereof, nor hath any ear in the realm of possibility heard its parallel. Yet certain deluded ones are seen who, like unto the people of the Bayan and the Qur'an, cling to the cord of idle fancies and are deprived of the lights of the Day-Star of certitude. Say: O people! Today the ocean of inner meanings is surging and the sun of divine knowledge is shining and manifest. Have mercy upon yourselves and the Cause; be not once again the cause of dissension. Fix your gaze upon the horizon of the one true Revelation. This is the station of true unity and the light of divine wisdom. The former people claimed a new Lord each day, and you have seen and heard what was the fruit thereof on the Day of Judgment. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancies in the days of God, the Lord of lords. Make mention of the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the mercy of the All-Merciful and the bounty of the All-Glorious, that the utterance of the All-Merciful may attract them and draw them nigh unto Him at all times.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath loved Me and cast away all else, holding fast unto that which hath been sent down in the Psalms and Tablets. We wish to end this Tablet with his mention, that he may rejoice in the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of creation. We testify that he hath attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. In these days that hath come to pass which causeth the heart of the world to be sorrowful. The martyrdom of assured souls hath been and continueth to be the cause of the exaltation of the Word, yet some have added that which is not worthy of mention. Glory be to God! Those who considered themselves the daysprings of steadfastness are seen to be the dawning-places of vain imaginings. Prayer for this Wronged One is necessary.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Should anyone ask thee about the Lamp, say: By God, it is amidst the winds! And should anyone ask thee about the Tree, say: It is beneath the swords of malice! Have they not read the Most Holy Book? Have they not discovered the fragrance of its verses? Tribulation, hardship, martyrdom, adversity and torment in the path of God are sweeter than honey and constitute a supreme bounty. However, the suspicions of certain loved ones have caused the heart to melt. By My life! Hearts have been consumed by the waves of hatred that have encompassed the Ark of God, the Lord of all beings. Convey My greetings, glory, mention and splendor to the true loved ones. We beseech God to aid all to that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Under all conditions, occupy thyself with the refinement of souls. Verily He teacheth you, preserveth you, and aideth you through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, from God, the Mighty, the Bestower. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have cast the world behind them, and have stood before all faces saying: \"God is our Lord, the Lord of our forebears, and the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat.\" Blessed is 'Ali-Akbar, whom We informed beforehand of his captivity and what would befall him from the hosts of the oppressors. These assured and contented souls were mentioned aforetime by the Supreme Pen. Verily We informed him of this as a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed is he who remembereth him, assisteth him and respondeth to him on this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. Convey My greetings to his wife and give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy which have preceded all things. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At this moment We make mention of him who was named Amin in My perspicuous Book. We beseech God to protect him from the evil of the heedless ones, to aid him through the hosts of the exalted ones, and to draw him ever closer unto Him. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00744 ===\n\n=== START BH00745 ===\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!\n\nGlorified be He Who mentions whomsoever He willeth through His command, and bestoweth upon whomsoever He desireth whatsoever He pleaseth of His knowledge. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. In His hand is the dominion of all things, and He granteth unto His servants that which maketh them independent of all the worlds. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Peerless, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Beauteous.\n\nSay: In the sending down of tribulations and trials are signs for them that believe, and in the flowing of tears upon the cheek and the shedding of blood are manifestations for them that are lovers. Then know thou that We traversed the path until We reached the shore of a mighty sea, and this is what We mentioned in the previous year, if ye be of them that know. Then We boarded the ark, and this was ordained by God, the Powerful, the All-Wise. And the sea became calm from its waves until God's trust reached the seashore, and We departed from it by leave of the All-Praised, the All-Knowing.\n\nWe arrived in the month that was mentioned unto you and remained therein for several months as was ordained in the holy and preserved Tablets. When the appointed time was fulfilled and its term completed, We departed to another land beyond mighty mountains. This is what We had beseeched God in those days - that He might remove Us from among these people and place between Me and the hypocrites that which would sever from Me the hands of the malevolent. Thus did We dwell beyond the mountains in a place wherefrom no clamor would reach Us, and even if it should, the ears of the idolaters would not hear it. The bounty was lifted from their midst and returned to God's treasury, the Most Exalted, the Powerful. But the believers hear Our call and the breezes of the Cause reach them at all times.\n\nSay: O people! Rejoice not that the sun hath disappeared behind thick clouds of command, nor find tranquility in the world and its ornaments, for God shall soon take from you all wherein ye pride yourselves this day, and ye shall be numbered among the arrogant. Say: By God! The Badakhshan of power shall not give you what ye have lost of this brilliant ruby, nor shall the clouds of glory grant you what ye have been denied in My absence, if ye be of them that know. Ye shall not find in the shells of the sea of creation what ye have lost of this preserved pearl, nor shall the trees of eternity offer you the like of what hath vanished from you of this fresh, ripe, and delicate fruit.\n\nSay: Are ye able to stop the breezes of God, or imprison the fragrances of glory, or prevent the people from the path of God, the Wise, the Just, the All-Encompassing? Nay, by the Lord of might! Ye shall never be able, nor shall ye have the power, even if all who are in the heavens and earth should aid you. Say: Verily, Pharaoh and his nobles gathered to block the gates of grace and prevent the people from God's mercy, and they plotted therein with all their might in times long past. But when the promise came, God opened the gate of providence in His house, and therein flowed the sea of mercy, while Pharaoh was denied a single drop thereof, despite his pride. Thus was the matter decreed of old by the Sovereign of wise command. And Pharaoh searched for Moses throughout the land while he was in his own house, and he perceived it not. Thus do We relate unto thee from the true stories that thine eyes may be consoled thereby and that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are certain, and know that the Cause is in His hand and the decree is within the grasp of His power\\[...\\]\n\nSovereignty is within His grasp. He doeth whatsoever He willeth, and no plotter's plot, no schemer's scheme, no rejecter's rejection, and no denial from any rebellious satan can hinder Him. Be thou therefore confident in thy soul, then walk in my footsteps and deviate not therefrom, even should every wretched rejecter gather against thee. Walk thou in my path, and should thine eye oppose thee in this, pluck it out and turn not unto it, if thou be of them that hear. Love thou him who loveth God, whose deeds match his words, and whose very being confirmeth them. Then turn away from every base deceiver. Counsel the servants not to create disorder in God's earth, nor to dispute His Cause, nor to follow any sinful rebel. Beware lest thou walk on earth save with wisdom, and speak not save with wisdom, and be thou among the discerning ones. Open not thy mouth unless thou findest an attentive ear, and when thou findest a receptive ear, impart unto it what God hath graciously imparted unto thee, if thou be of them who remember. Open not thine eyes save unto a beauteous countenance, and if thou findest penetrating vision, show unto it what is concealed within thee of the beauty of knowledge, that thou mayest be of them who give glad tidings. Waste not the seed of wisdom in barren soil, and be not of the prodigal. But when thou findest good earth, deposit therein the seed of wisdom and knowledge, that there may grow therefrom a goodly and wondrous plant. Rain not the showers of eternity upon perishable temples, but rain upon such bodies as would, if given but a drop thereof, be quickened by God's leave, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Strive, O my brother, in the Word of God, and waste it not, neither spread it before the heedless. For verily, people are as yet unformed embryos, unable to reach the holy atmosphere or enter the pavilion of sublime and enduring glory, for they have cut off their wings with their own hands, and are thus barred from the canopy of eternity, falling to the earth of abasement with great remorse, depriving their ears of God's melodies and their eyes of the beauty of God, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThen remind, from Our presence, all those small and great from whom thou dost detect the fragrance of truthfulness and on whose faces thou seest the radiance of delight. Then conceal the Cause from those whose faces are turned to thee but whose hearts are set towards thine enemies, and who scheme at every moment. Turn away from these, neither associate with them nor sit in their chambers, nor dwell in their habitations. Be thou in mighty concealment. Shun such as these, be not neglectful in the Cause of God, transgress not beyond what thou hast been commanded, and be not of the transgressors. Then remind, from Our presence, the loved ones of God who are scattered throughout the regions of the world in every distant quarter, then in the land of Alif, the letter Fa, and in the land of Ya, the letters Ra and ?ad, and convey to them what We have sent unto thee, that thou mayest be of them that remember. Thus may their hearts be gladdened, their beings renewed, and they find the fragrance of the divine garment from this exalted Tablet. Then those who were in the land of Shin and ?ad, and besides these the cities of God, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful, that they may gird up their loins to aid the Cause of God and convey unto the people what God hath conveyed unto them, for verily He is the Munificent, the Generous. Thus do We cast upon thee from every wisdom that which God hath ordained for thee, that thou mayest find solace therein and be of the thankful. Then remind those who were round about thee and give them the glad tidings of Our remembrance of them, that they may rejoice within themselves and be of the detached. Then make mention, from Our presence, of the letter Jim, and glorify him and his son and those who were circumambulating round about the House. Then tend the House and its inhabitants with all that behooveth thee until God shall manifest what He desireth by His command. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted. As for what We promised thee during thy presence, that We would send thee that which is hidden in the shells of power, precious pearls of holiness, We have not sent it until now and shall send it hereafter if God willeth. Verily, He fulfilleth the rewards of the doers of good. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth and sent down unto thee this Tablet at the time when the face was covered with luminous white water. Peace be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon whoso hath hearkened to the counsel of this servant from this wondrous Pen. 152\n\n=== END BH00745 ===\n\n=== START BH00746 ===\n\nSweet as sugar become all India's parrots,\n\nFrom this Persian candy that to Bengal goes.\n\nHe is the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Supreme!\n\nYour letter reached the abode of evanescence and arrived at the treasury of submission and contentment. All that was written was noted, and all that was mentioned was true and correct. However, the lovers in the path of the Beloved and the confidants of the sanctuary of the Desired One fear not calamity and seek not to avoid fate. They are nourished by the ocean of submission and drink from the stream of Tasnim. They would not exchange the good-pleasure of the Friend for both worlds, nor would they trade the decree of the Beloved for the boundless realm. They drink the poison of tribulations as if it were the water of life, and quaff deadly venom as though it were life-giving honey. In waterless, perilous deserts they surge with the remembrance of the Friend, and in lethal wastelands they are quick to sacrifice their lives. They have withdrawn their hands from life and set forth toward the Beloved. They have shut their eyes to the world and opened them to the Beauty of the Friend. They have no purpose save the Beloved, and seek no perfection save reunion. They soar with the wing of trust and fly with the pinion of devotion. To them, the bloodthirsty sword is dearer than heavenly silk, and the sharp arrow more acceptable than mother's milk.\n\nA hundred thousand living hearts are needed on this path,\n\nTo sacrifice a hundred souls with every breath.\n\nOne should kiss the hand of the assassin and dance joyously towards the path of the Friend. How blessed is this hour and how sweet is this time when the spiritual soul is ready to sacrifice itself and the temple of faithfulness has resolved to ascend the heights of extinction. We have lifted up our necks, eagerly awaiting the unsparing sword of the Beloved, and have made our breasts \\[radiant\\], yearning with our very souls for the arrow of destiny. We are weary of name and fame, and from all else but Him we shall not choose flight nor occupy ourselves with dispelling others. Through prayer we seek tribulation that we might soar in the holy atmosphere of the spirit and build our nest in the shade of the tree of divine companionship, that we might attain the ultimate stations of love and drink from the sweet wines of reunion. Surely we shall not let slip from our grasp this eternal sovereignty, nor shall we let go from our hands this incomparable blessing. And if we should be buried in the dust, we shall raise our heads from the bosom of the Lord of Lords' mercy. These companions cannot be destroyed by tribulation, nor can these journeys be traversed by mere footsteps, nor can this countenance be veiled by the curtain of concealment. Indeed, it is evident that with all these enemies, both within and without, who have raised the standard of opposition and have girded themselves with utmost determination to repel these poor ones, one should certainly, according to the dictates of reason, exercise caution and choose to flee not only from this land but from the face of the earth. Yet through divine favor and infinite invisible confirmations, we are radiant like the sun and manifest like the moon, seated upon the throne of tranquility and resting upon the carpet of patience. What fear has the spiritual fish of the destruction of the ship, and what concern has the holy spirit for the corruption of the outward body? Nay, the body is a prison for this one, and the ship a cage for that one. The nightingale's song is known to the nightingale, and the familiar strain to those who are familiar. Consider the days of old and what befell the Seal of the Prophets and the Source of the Chosen Ones, that you might become light as spirit and emerge like breath from the cage of the body. At the height of the encompassment of enemies and the intensity of trials, the sacred Bird descended and brought this verse: \"And if their turning away is grievous to thee, then, if thou canst, seek out an opening into the earth or a ladder into heaven.\" A thousand eyes are needed to weep blood, and a hundred thousand souls to raise a cry from the heart. And likewise in another place He says: \"And remember when the unbelievers plotted against thee, to imprison thee, or slay thee, or drive thee forth. They plotted, and God plotted, and God is the best of plotters.\" In these two blessed verses which were revealed from the Source of Divinity, reflect deeply that you might become aware of the hidden mysteries. Were people's eyes of insight open, this very persistence of this servant would suffice them all - that despite all these enemies and instances of tribulation, we are luminous like a candle, and like love's beloved we have burned away the veils of concealment in the gathering as we have kindled the fire of love. But what use is it when all eyes are veiled and all ears are stopped? They wander in the valley of heedlessness and walk in the wilderness of error. \"They are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what they do.\" Let it be known to you that one of the divines who is occupied with worldly ornaments and \\[...\\]\n\nHe has no share from the chalice of mercy, and no portion from the cup of justice and equity. Not for a moment has he seen this servant, nor gathered in any assembly, nor sought companionship for an hour. Yet he has taken up the pen of oppression, writing with the blood of the oppressed, and has spoken certain meaningless words to a group. In these very days he has related some of his suspicious thoughts to a certain well-known person, who has now gone to Tehran with a book of tales and a volume of stories.\n\nWhatever schemes of deceit he harbors in his heart\n\nBefore God are manifest and exposed as the day\n\nAll these matters are known and evident, and their foundations are disclosed and confirmed. Though they may conceal it from this servant, how can it remain hidden from Him from Whose knowledge nothing escapes? I know not by what divine law they claim to abide, or upon what proof they rely. This servant, who for some time has completely withdrawn into seclusion and chosen solitude, who has closed his door to friend and stranger alike and sits alone - whence arose this envy, and from where did this hatred appear? It is not known whether they will ultimately achieve good and attain their heart's desire. Though they walk the path of passion, this lowly one clings to the cord of piety and, God willing, is guided by the light of divine guidance. I harbor no ill will toward them and have taken no rancor to heart. I have left it to God and held fast to the handle of justice. After they achieve their aims, perhaps they shall drink from the boiling waters of hell and be sustained by the fire of divine wrath, for there is a mighty Judge between us who surely will not let injustice pass. Eventually, there must be a meeting where matters are made clear and the truth becomes evident to them. Then judgment will be passed - decided and executed. Their suspicious hands are short, while the tree of divine favor is exceedingly tall. Until our time comes, no soul has power over us, and when that moment arrives, we shall seek it with yearning and desire - it shall neither come early nor late. Verily we are God's and to Him do we return. If God helps you, none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there that can help you thereafter? Peace be upon those who follow guidance. Though I have been and am desirous of meeting you, it is not advisable. Remain in complete tranquility, engaged in visitation, and weary of all but His presence. Convey my remembrances to the loved ones, especially to His Highness Isma'il Mirza. All these matters were related to you last year, but seem to have been erased from memory.\n\n=== END BH00746 ===\n\n=== START BH00747 ===\n\nThis is what the Tongue of Utterance hath spoken: His mention hath been made before the Face, and We have mentioned him in such wise as to cause the ocean of utterance to surge in the kingdom of exposition, and the sweet savors of the mention of the All-Merciful to be wafted among all possibilities. We beseech God to aid him, to make him successful in attaining His good-pleasure, and to ordain for him the reward of those who visit Him in spirit and fragrance. Verily the Pen loveth to make mention of the peoples who have held fast to the hem of the Ancient of Days in these times, the like of which have not been witnessed in the past nor shall be seen in the future. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the soul that hath detached itself, turned towards God, and attained the mention of the Most Great One from the Lord of the Beginning and the End. We beseech God to make Us and those who have believed steadfast in His Cause and in acting according to His good-pleasure. This is better for us than all that hath been created in the worlds.\n\nThere hath come before the Face a letter from the Noble One, from whom We perceived the fragrance of his love for the Beloved of the worlds. Previously, a glorious letter was sent to him in eloquent Persian which, by My life, causeth the hearts of the lovers to soar and the fire of separation to be stilled. We beseech God to solace his eyes through meeting Him. He, verily, is the Protector of the doers of good. Give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him time and again. O My physician! By My life, the breezes of Truth waft at all times from the direction of grace towards the loved ones of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Say: Blessed art thou, O Noble One, for thy letter hath come, adorned with the mention of Him through Whom God's binding Word was made manifest and every wise matter distinguished. We beseech God to make him and those with him successful, and also he whose letter was in his handwriting, and to unite them upon one Word. Verily His mercy hath preceded every small and great one.\n\nLikewise came a letter from \"B\" before \"Q\" who attained the presence in the Land of Mystery and was occupied with the verses of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he, for We found in his letter pure servitude towards God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. How excellent is the soul that hath adorned its temple with the ornament of servitude. This is truly an exalted station. O Baqir! Grieve not over anything. Trust in God in all matters. He is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him, and He is the Protector of those who advance towards Him. Give glad-tidings to the people of \"N\" of their mention in the court of the Throne. For each one of them hath been written a reward and station which none knoweth save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Then remind him who wept in separation. A letter hath been revealed for him and We sent it with \"S\". We beseech God to make him a herald of His Name, steadfast in His love, and one who speaketh His praise among His slumbering servants. O Baqir! Be as thy Lord desireth thee to be, such that everyone possessed of smell may detect from thee the fragrance of holiness. This is My counsel unto thee and My word for thee and for those who have held fast to the hem of the Holy, the Luminous One.\n\nO Baqir! Hearken in Persian: Today it behooveth all to be sanctified and holy to such extent that the fragrances of truth may at all times waft from the people of truth amongst creation. Thy letter hath arrived. Praise the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast attained unto His mention and become assured of His Cause. Convey My greetings unto him who is named Muhammad the Bookbinder and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him. The treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal it. Blessed is he for having attained the recognition of the Beloved and turned with his heart toward the direction of the Intended One. We beseech God to grant him success, to aid him, and to make him among the steadfast ones.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked concerning the Night of Power, say: The Most Great Day hath appeared, and around it hath circled the Night of Power, after We revealed it and adorned it with the ornament of Our mighty and impregnable Name. When it passed, its mention becometh not befitting. Hold fast unto the Most Great Day, whereon God shone forth upon all things. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. He Who announced unto men My Revelation hath interpreted it. It hath been adorned with that which was revealed therein of the Letter \"Ha',\" from which have branched all the oceans of names. Know thou this and be of the thankful ones. In its outward appearance, it is the night wherein the Beloved of the worlds was born, and mention of it hath been revealed in the Tablet which We have adorned with this mighty and wondrous remembrance.\n\nThe Mighty Pen forgetteth not to make mention of the Exalted One and those who are with him from among God's sincere servants. Blessed are they, inasmuch as they have acquiesced in that which hath been sent down from the Pen of Command from their Lord, the Most High, and have returned with manifest joy. Upon them be the glory of God, His remembrance, and His praise. By My life! There hath been revealed for them that which shall solace the eyes of the monotheists.\n\nThen make mention of him who was named Nabil-i-Baqir, who hath believed in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as thy letter hath attained unto this noble Scene. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou knowest my turning unto Thee, my facing toward Thy Self, my clinging to the hem of Thy mercy, and my holding fast unto the cord of Thy favors. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast raised up the heavens of Thy Cause and sent down the tokens of Thy oneness, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that nothing shall prevent me from turning toward Thee. Moreover, ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, who move not except by Thy leave and will. Then cause me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy will and to be enkindled with the fire of Thy love. O my Lord! Thou knowest what profiteth me. Write down for me that which is best for me. I have placed my trust in Thee and have committed my affairs unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Kind, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned concerning the debt of him who was named Muhammad, excellent is that which thou hast done. Blessed art thou for having borne hardships in thy Lord's path. He repayeth whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Generous. If the loved ones in that land are able to give to certain of God's loved ones and handmaidens, with utter humility and submissiveness, and complete detachment and absolute freedom from worldly ornaments, it would be and will be acceptable in the sight of God - that is, they should record all as a debt until an appointed time. Excellent is that which Our honored servant hath done regarding Our glorious Name. We beseech God to assist him in this. Soon will thy Lord repay the debts of His loved ones and bestow from His grace upon those servants who have assisted them in their affairs. He, verily, is the Rewarder of the doers of good.\n\nMake mention of the youth named 'Ali. Say: That which thou didst send previously hath attained Our presence, but We have no house to adorn. Verily, thy Lord is in the hands of the oppressors.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned regarding the remembrance of Muhammad-'Ali, say: We have heard thy call. Grieve not. He is with thee. He is with His servants who have held fast unto the cord of His love, detached from all the worlds. Upon thee be My glory from this Scene which hath been illumined with the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned regarding the remembrance of the wife of Our Name the Mahdi, convey to her My greetings and give her the glad-tidings of her Lord's loving-kindness toward her. She is among those women who have believed in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to solace her eyes through meeting Him and to make her one of those who have attained.\n\nO physician! We have noted the letter from Ghulam-Husayn, who attained and returned, and signs of sorrow were evident therein. Convey to him, on behalf of this Prisoner, profound greetings, and say: You must be thankful at all times and be seen in the utmost joy and gladness, for praise be to God, through the favors of the Ancient King, you attained the Most Great Prison and were blessed with attaining His presence. The bounties of God have never been, nor ever shall be, confined or limited to any one thing. If there be a delay in sending Tablets specifically intended for certain loved ones, this hath not been, nor is it, evidence of the absence of divine favors. Verily, He heareth the call of the seekers and accompanieth His God-fearing servants. God willing, through His grace, you will soar in the atmosphere of joy and traverse the expanse of gladness. Be confident in the bounty of your Lord. Verily, He loveth those who love Him. Be not grieved by your poverty, for truly wealthy is he in whose heart are found the pearls of the knowledge of Our Name, the Mighty, the Great. We beseech God to assist those who have believed to turn their attention to your affairs. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\n=== END BH00747 ===\n\n=== START BH00748 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nThough I acknowledge that He cannot be remembered by any remembrance save His own, and confess that He cannot be described by any description but His, I make mention of Him in accordance with what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. In truth, the world of the heart hath no joy save His remembrance, and the grief and sorrow of hearts and souls find no relief except in His memory. His remembrance is the source of gladness and His praise the dayspring of delight. Praise be unto Him, again praise be unto Him, for having made us know His remembrance and guided us to His path. I testify that He is the All-Bountiful, possessed of ancient grace. And peace and blessings be upon the Dayspring of His mighty signs and His all-encompassing and manifest evidences, through Whom knowledge was spread abroad and the arts appeared and the hidden was revealed, and upon His family and companions, the arks of guidance and the dawning-places of knowledge and wisdom - blessings befitting their glorious station and their exalted rank.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Thy letter, which was adorned with the praise and remembrance of the Lord of all being and His chosen ones and pure ones, transformed the ocean of sorrow into a sea of joy and changed the carpet of grief into one of gladness. After it was read and perused, it was taken to the Most Great Spot and presented before His face, attaining the honor of His attention. He said: \"O Amin, upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds! Praise be to God, thou art successful through His bounty and illumined by the lights of the Sun of His remembrance. Through the loftiness of the learned and the wise, the baseness of the ignorant and heedless is made manifest. From the honor of the righteous in the sight of the All-Choosing One, the abasement of the wicked becometh apparent. Thy letter was mentioned before the Wronged One. The fragrance of steadfastness and love was wafted therefrom. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to raise up through His Afnan and through thee and His loved ones the standards of trustworthiness and godliness, of truthfulness and sincerity amongst all men, and to strengthen you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Helper.\" And We beseech Him to make manifest through your existence the trustworthiness of the people of truth and the treachery of the faithless and the false ones. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Whatsoever hath appeared from the Afnan - upon him be My peace and loving-kindness - hath been fitting and appropriate. Were it not for divine inspiration, specific instructions would certainly have been given outwardly. The reins of hearts are within His mighty grasp, and the reins of understanding are in the right hand of His will. We beseech Him to aid and assist you in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nIn these days, once again a detailed letter has arrived from those friends, urgently requesting the presence of the Afnan, and from their words lamentation and mourning can be heard. Therefore, We have approved their attention to that direction. This matter was also mentioned before. Letters are continuously arriving, requesting him with utmost humility and lowliness. The Overseer, upon him be God's peace, has given his attention. God willing, through the light of justice and the power of truth, their innocence shall be proven and established. We have previously mentioned before the authorities that the heaven of divine wisdom is illumined by two luminaries: consultation and kindness, and the pavilion of world order is raised upon two pillars: reward and punishment. God willing, may his honor the Assistant be confirmed in the execution of justice. This is a mighty station with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have mentioned and continue to mention the friends. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the honored Nabil-Ibn-i-Nabil and those with him and those with you. For each one We ask that which is everlasting and enduring. Verily, God is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nO beloved of my heart! A group of the honored Afnans, upon them be Baha'u'llah's Most Glorious Glory, have with utmost diligence and effort sought out the honored Afnan, upon him be Baha'u'llah and His favors. According to what is known, most have signed this matter and have beseeched God. Therefore, permission has been granted. This servant begs his Lord to make the end of all matters good. This evanescent servant offers greetings and praise to the honored Afnan, upon him be Baha'u'llah's Most Glorious Glory, and in all conditions beseeches victory and triumph for him. Verily God is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAnd likewise, he conveys greetings and praise to each of the friends, upon them be Baha'u'llah and His favors. The One God is witness that all are remembered in the heart - a remembrance that, through God's favor, glorified be His majesty, will neither be forgotten nor fall behind. In these days a letter arrived from the beloved of the heart, the honored Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah's Most Glorious Glory. He was in the land of Ha and Mim and wrote details about the lack of moderation of some in that land. Glory be to God! From other directions - from 'Ayntab and Kurdistan, as well as the people of Ha and Mim - they have mentioned reprehensible deeds of Dervish Gh-l. Until now no response has been given regarding this matter. Indeed, the mentioned deeds have caused the Cause of God to be wasted. In any case, countless complaints have been made about him and another soul. Such matters have been and continue to be the cause of great sorrow.\n\nHowever, they have written very well about the acceptance of the servants and the exaltation of the Cause, and they have written about that beloved one that which is the cause of greatest joy. Among other things, they have written that in every land where he has gone, the people there, upon mentioning that beloved one, exclaim \"O what longing!\" and they have written that all mention him with the most wondrous utterance and have sought from God to meet that beloved one again. Were it not for your good deeds, they would have been consumed by the fire of the heedless ones' misdeeds. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist His servants to be trustworthy and religious, and to act according to what He has revealed in His Book.\n\nFrom the land of ?a also, a detailed letter has arrived from the spiritual beloved 'Ali-Qabli-Haydar, upon him be Baha'u'llah. Praise be to God, the friends of that land, through the favor of the Sultan, may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him, are all at ease and occupied with divine thanksgiving. Indeed, they have expended and continue to expend great effort in serving and improving the affairs of the friends. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect him from the evil of his enemies and to perpetuate the days of his mention and praise and service.\n\nThis evanescent servant takes God, exalted be His glory, and all the Prophets and Messengers as witness that he has ever besought and continues to beseech from the heaven of grace and the ocean of bounty, protection, exaltation, mercy, glory and blessing for His servants, as well as assistance in deeds and virtues that are the cause of nearness and the means of salvation. Nevertheless, I am greatly perplexed by the actions of some who, despite counsels and exhortations, have caused their own stations to be wasted. This year, complaints about certain souls have come from every direction, and likewise from one of the cities in these regions, a reprehensible deed and \\[...\\]\n\nHave they not heard and understood the stations of righteousness and piety in the Book of God? Glory be to God! Some act upon that which hath been clearly and evidently forbidden in the Book of God, while they have abandoned that which hath been commanded more manifest than the sun itself. We beseech God to assist all to return unto Him. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Ever-Relenting, the Merciful. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon thee and upon those who have held fast unto justice and equity and unto that which they have been bidden by the All-Knowing Commander.\n\nThe Servant\n\n9 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1307\n\n=== END BH00748 ===\n\n=== START BH00749 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nThe command belongeth unto God Who, through a wave from the ocean of His trials, hath drowned countless souls whose number none knoweth save His all-knowing, all-informed Self. Exalted, exalted is He at Whose word all who are in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, then through another word of His were raised up servants whom none hath known save He, and He is the Truth, the All-Numbering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Word in one station is expressed as the Trumpet, and when it is blown again, behold, they stand and gaze.\n\nO God of Names and Creator of Heaven! I beseech Thee by the kingdom of Thy Cause, and the might of Thy Revelation, and the divine realm of Thy glory, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon all existence that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, guide them to Thy path, acquaint them with Thy station, cause them to speak Thy praise, and attract them to Thy mighty and impregnable Kingdom. Then protect, O my God, Thy Afnan who hath risen to serve Thee. This servant testifieth that he hath, for numbered years after being enkindled with the fire of Thy love and tasting the sweetness of Thy utterance, arisen to serve Thy Cause in such wise that all things behind me bear witness to this. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all names. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your standing and service. The honored letter dated the 11th of Dhi'l-Qa'dah was graciously received. Praise and thanks be to Him Who continuously and successively favors this evanescent one with blessed leaves adorned with the ornament of love for the Beloved of the worlds. All bounty and all sustenance referreth to Him and descendeth from the heaven of His favor - all is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He created, guided, and taught knowledge and refinement. The purpose hath been the manifestation of the human essence, that it might attain to the recognition of the Countenance of Unity and be exalted to eternal life. The Sun of generosity hath shone forth, and from that effulgence another effulgence appeared, and from that effulgence yet another became manifest, and from these effulgences the world became illumined and radiant. One of these stations, through His grace and bounty, is the station of the Afnan. Exalted is He Who hath related them to Him, and exalted is He Who hath mentioned them in that which never endeth. God willing, you shall at all times be engaged in mention, praise and service to His Cause, as you have been and are.\n\nRegarding the House, according to His command it is contingent upon a clear future command, and its mention is not permitted until God cometh with His decree.\n\nNews of His Holiness Ism-i-Sittih (Name of God), upon him be all glory, hath repeatedly reached this region. They desired to extinguish the light of God through their devices and quench His fire through their vain imaginings. Far, far from it! However, from the allusions in the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds, it was understood that some of the friends have again disturbed the government, and thus after ease came hardship. But as it was from fear and hope of deliverance, they were graced with pardon. The loved ones of the land of Ta, upon them be the glory of God, are afflicted with two trials - internal investigators from the right and external ones from the left. The command is in the hand of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nThat which was written concerning the honored Chief, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory - praise be to God that he succeeded in that which the company of divines and jurists remained veiled from. In these days, in a letter this servant was writing in response to His Holiness the beloved Aqa Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, this most exalted Word was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of creation, exalted be His majesty: \"Time and again it was heard that the nobles would flee from the Word of His Holiness the Qa'im, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, and the company of divines would be bewildered and perplexed as to what that Word might be. And now they have fled before even hearing it, and are unaware. And that Word is this: 'He hath appeared in the garment of 'I', and the Hidden One speaketh with the voice of 'I am the One known'.' This is the Word that causeth the limbs of polytheism to quake and the hearts of the world to be troubled.\" Thus ended the divine utterance. This statement hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in numerous instances - one meaning clad in diverse expressions. May He grant the right of fairness, that they might at least understand this much: that the Word from which the nobles flee surely giveth them no rest - \"As if they were frightened asses fleeing from a lion!\" In any case, mention of the honored Chief was made in the Most Holy Court, and he hath attained divine favors. That which he sent was adorned with the ornament of acceptance, and the receipt was also sent.\n\nAs to the mention of the honored Mulla Husayn, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, that he should be remembered in the Most Holy Court - this was presented, and this is what was revealed for him from the Kingdom of our Lord's Will, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Exalted be His grandeur:\n\nHe is the Manifest, the Hidden\n\nO Husayn! The story of Husayn hath returned. The Desired One of the world calleth out to the peoples from the Most Great Prison and summoneth them to the most exalted Summit, yet the people, heedless, have arisen with swords of steel and arrows of rejection, and strive with utmost effort to shed His pure blood. The very One Who hath removed strife and conflict from the world they have regarded and do regard as among the workers of corruption. By God's life! He hath come for the reformation of the world - to this testifieth the Mother Book before the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is the soul whom the oppression of the oppressors hath not prevented from the Beloved of all possibility, and whom the might of the idolaters hath not held back from taking hold of the Book. Give thanks to the Ancient Beauty, Who hath aided thee to recognize Him and enabled thee to achieve that for which all have been created yet from which they remain heedless. Ere long shall the monotheists behold their station and the polytheists their place. Convey My greetings to those souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of the Merciful's utterance and who are illumined and radiant through the dawning lights of the countenance of the Face. Say: This is the day of steadfastness, the day of service, and the day of arising. The glory from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, be upon thee and upon them. Thus ended the divine utterance.\n\nSeveral days ago, in the letter of the honored Trustee, that is, my beloved Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, verses were specifically revealed for him from the heaven of God's Will and were sent. The honored one mentioned hath repeatedly made mention of them. By God's life! Every steadfast soul is today the recipient of an everlasting sovereignty - a sovereignty that cannot be described and that thought cannot comprehend before its manifestation. Blessed be they that attain!\n\nAnd as for the mention made of the honored Haji M.L.K ?.S., upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory - praise be to God, they have attained God's favors and their mention was made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. The servant beseecheth his Lord to open before his face the gate of unveiling and attainment. Verily, He doeth what He willeth, and in His grasp is the reins of all things.\n\nThe letter of receipt has been sent. This servant's final submission is to convey greetings and praise to the friends and believers of that land, and beseeches God to assist all to accomplish deeds that are befitting of the Day of God. Most regrettable and lamentable it is that some are unaware of the station of this time and are moved by their own desires. The True One, exalted be His glory, has been and ever shall be the Concealer, and I beseech Him, exalted be His station, to sanctify them from that which they possess and to bestow upon them that which He possesses. May the glory shining forth from the horizon of our Lord's favor rest upon you, upon your brethren, your children, and your brethren's children, and upon those who have clung to the hem of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

When these were presented before His Holiness \\[the Master\\] - may the souls of all in the invisible and visible worlds be sacrificed for His sake - He commanded: Write to him: \"O Ghulam! Some of what thou hast said is correct and some incorrect. We do not accept all of it. The praiseworthy attributes, praise be to God, have been and are manifold. Hearken, that We may tell thee: Thou didst hear the call of the Herald, and didst turn toward the Friend's sanctuary, and wert favored with an answer, and didst circumambulate, and wert honored with the remembrance of the Friend. Yes, man is prone to forgetfulness and error, but every dust is and shall be cleansed by the water of sanctification, and every transgression has been and shall be effaced by the water of forgiveness, for God, exalted be His glory, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Merciful, the All-Kind, the All-Forgiving, the All-Seeing, the Answerer of Prayer. God willing, from the boundless ocean of His generosity, He hath forgiven and will forgive thee and the friends. He is the All-Bountiful One before Whose generosity all the world and its treasures are mere nothingness and utter void. In any case, We have recorded as good deeds the two equal shortcomings which thou hadst written of. And as for morals, We beseech Him to adorn them with a spirit gentle, pure, holy, God-fearing and radiant. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of the heavens and the earth. Say:\n\n\"Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all things, my Sovereign and the Sovereign of all who are in the kingdom of names! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst change fire into light, and prison into paradise, and sorrow into joy, and grief into delight, and darkness into light, that Thou mayest ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will adorn me with the ornament of Thy will, O Lord of all names! Thou art He Who created me and sustained me and nurtured me by the hands of Thy tender mercy until I grew up in Thy kingdom and Thou didst cause me to know Thy straight path and Thy mighty and great highway. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, my Creator and my Provider, that Thou deprive me not of that which Thou lovest, nor withhold from me that which Thou hast chosen. Make me, then, in all conditions, content with Thy good-pleasure and clinging to the cord of Thy loving care. O Lord! I am the poor one, the lowly, the wretched, the abject, and Thou art the All-Sufficient, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Potent.\"\n\nMention had been gathered together, and favor was manifest towards each one. God willing, may all be joyous and cognizant of the worth of their day and station. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey mention and greetings to each one. God willing, may they attain to God's grace, God's mercy, God's good-pleasure and God's favor. Praise be to God, your letter brought a smile to the Beloved's face and was the cause of joy. As commanded, say to Jenab-i-Aqa Lutfu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God: \"Dear father, he attained to God's favor and at the time of his ascension and advancement, God's grace encompassed him. By My life, verily he is in the highest companionship and beholds at every moment the favor of God, the Lord of the worlds.\" God, exalted be His glory, is great and generous - the world displays His bounty and the seas are a sign of His grace. We beseech Him to forgive you and remit your sins and adorn you with the ornament of His mercy which has preceded existence in both the unseen and visible realms. Be not grieved - this is the time for joy. Hold fast to the cord of His favor, be confident in His grace and stand firm in His love. These three became four - mention was multiplied but sanctified beyond number. Be grateful and among those who render thanks.\n\nPraise befitteth and is worthy of the King of all worshipped beings Who, through a single revelation of the word \"I am the Lord,\" made countless servants to appear. He bestowed favor, He created, He granted knowledge, He conferred understanding, and adorned all with the crown of wisdom that they might know Him and attain to His purpose. Blessed is the seeing, hearing one who saw and heard, and woe to the blind and deaf who were deprived and excluded. And blessings and peace be upon His chosen one and the best of His creation, the beginning of His Cause and the seal of His utterance, through whose Book books were ended and through whose presence messengers were concluded, and upon his family and companions whom God made lamps of guidance among creation and suns of justice in the kingdom - they through whom trembling seized the inhabitants of the realms of unbelief and earthquakes the people of polytheism and remoteness.\n\nThereafter, some time ago your letter arrived and became the cause of countless sorrows. Details were submitted and He said:\n\nO Rida! Has your ear not attained to the blessed word \"Give glad tidings to the patient ones\"? Have you not found and perceived the sweetness of patience and forbearance in the path of the Peerless Friend? He says \"and the patient in adversity and affliction and in time of conflict.\" Hear the call of the Wronged One and be content with what He has ordained and give thanks for His consummate wisdom. None is aware - oftentimes from pain He brings forth a hundred thousand comforts, and from illness He produces health. Have you not seen how He transformed the prison into paradise? Have you not heard how He made poison sweeter and more pleasant than honey? Were it not that heedlessness encompassed some who are unaware of the ocean of knowledge and were occupied with their own doings, you would now behold all these regions illumined and honored with the light of glory, wealth, riches, comfort and grandeur. What was destined has come to pass, and command belongeth unto God, the Lord of all names.\n\nPraise be unto God! Such bounty hath been observed and is being observed that it needeth not mention by this servant. If thou wert thirsty, thou hast attained unto the water of utterance; if thou wert hungry, thou hast gained access to the heavenly table; and if thou wert seeking, thou hast heard the call of the Sought One. God willing, thou shalt at all times gain access to the Kawthar of utterance and the table of the All-Merciful, and be freed and delivered from aught else but the Truth. The Glory be upon thee and upon Inayatu'llah and his mother and his sister, and upon all who seek to tread the Path.

Convey my greetings to him and say that in these days, praise be to God, news of the well-being of the friends in your lands hath been received. All are joyous and occupied with the remembrance of God. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may grant success unto all the peoples of the earth and bestow upon them a portion from the ocean of His generosity. In these days, observe justice like unto a sparrow and tyranny like unto a falcon. What power hath the sparrow to spread its wings and soar in his presence, let alone to learn and to teach? The Command is in the hand of God, the Lord of all worlds. Praise be to God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.

Through the bounty of the Lord of the worlds thou hast attained unto the manifest horizon and been blessed in these resplendent days with the dawning light of the Ancient Beauty. The Cause hath ever been, and shall forever remain, within the grasp of God's omnipotent power. Many are the souls whom He hath, after their acceptance of the Faith, raised from the lowest depths to the most exalted heights where the light of His countenance doth shine forth, leading them to the All-Glorious Horizon. Others, through their own actions, He hath cast down from the loftiest heights to the lowest of stations. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\n\nBlessed is the one who hath, in these days of the Lord of creation, drunk from the chalice of detachment and arisen with utmost sincerity to serve the King of all mankind. As thou dost witness, certain souls have emerged from the horizon of detachment in such wise that they regard all else but God as non-existent and have relinquished all they possess for that which is with God. Though such souls are and shall ever be rarer than the rarest substance, yet in these days, through divine grace and heavenly bounty, a few can be found who have, with the utmost determination, girded up their loins to serve the Cause. Their worth is not known today, but by My life, God shall make them, both outwardly and inwardly, the source of all goodly mention. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nOn behalf of the Wronged One, convey greetings to all the loved ones. I counsel all humanity to remain steadfast in the Cause, to be faithful to their religion, and to uphold trustworthiness, which hath ever been and shall forever remain beloved. Blessed is he who hath adorned his temple with the raiment of trustworthiness. All must attain unto this luminous vesture, that all who dwell on earth may be guided by the deeds of God's loved ones. A goodly deed itself guideth humanity, as hath been witnessed when certain blessed souls performed such praiseworthy acts that through these very deeds people were drawn to accept the Faith and were attracted to the shores of the ocean of oneness.\n\nNothing hath been created without a fragrance; all things have had and shall have their own sweet scent. Blessed is the soul from whom emanates the fragrance of the raiment of holiness. Such a one is indeed among the choicest of creation in the sight of God. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Amin, for having turned unto God, entered His presence, attained His court, won His good-pleasure, beheld His glory, and hearkened unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Through the warmth of divine love, thou must manifest thyself in every land in such a manner that all shall be stirred by that warmth and turn their hearts toward the Beloved, for the path of the faithful servant hath been barred through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought.\n\nO Amin! The cause of motion is heat, and the cause of heat is the Word of God. Therefore must the loved ones, through the fire of God's Word, guide His servants from the left hand of idle fancies to the right hand of certitude, and through the warmth of the divine Word be so stirred that they may ascend from the fleeting realms of self to the sublime heights of eternity. O Amin! If people were to act according to the divine virtues and heavenly attributes recorded in the revealed Tablets, thou wouldst surely witness all who dwell on earth turning unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.\n\nStations of sanctification, detachment, acceptance, nearness and attainment unto His presence are not, and never shall be, incompatible with outward affairs. In this Most Great Revelation, all are commanded to engage in crafts, trades and professions, placing their trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This commandment hath been emphatically revealed in the Tablets. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which his Lord, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, hath ordained. Rejoice, O Trustee, in that We have adorned thee with the raiment of trustworthiness. Guard thou this station. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds. We beseech God to grant thee success in all conditions and to aid thee in that which He desireth. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good.\n\nThou hast become aware of some of the tribulations that have befallen this Prisoner. It is evident to every person of insight that We are immersed in an ocean of trials and are seated beneath the hands of the oppressors, inasmuch as We have never compromised in the Cause of God with any of the most distinguished among the people of the world, nor with those beneath them, as can be understood from the Tablets that were sent to the rulers of the earth. Therefore it is clear and evident to every just and discerning person that all these souls have been, and continue to be, secretly harboring the utmost hatred toward this Voice of Truth. Yet notwithstanding these matters, We have at all times called the people unto the truth and continue to do so. Were the people to reflect even slightly upon that which hath appeared, they would know with certainty that this Cause hath been made manifest through the power of God and hath shone forth with divine sovereignty and might, and that never hath it regarded, nor will it ever regard, its own ease, comfort or deliverance. Its example is as a nightingale caught in the talons of oppression. O people of the earth! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, Who crieth out purely for the sake of God. Reflect somewhat upon the world and the events and consequences thereof, and likewise upon that which hath dawned from the horizon of the Cause and hath appeared in His days. Perchance ye may thus perceive that the One Who calleth out doth so for God's sake and speaketh by God's command, lest ye be deprived of the eternal stations by the cawing of the heedless and the doubts of the deluded - whether they be among those who are known by the name of truth or those who are not. Behold this Prisoner as a target, at whom arrows fly continuously and successively from all directions. Yet through divine grace He hath thus far remained protected, and afterwards the matter resteth in His hands. Verily, I love what He loveth and desire what He desireth, and I long for whatsoever God hath ordained for Me, for that which appeareth from Him is My Beloved and the Beloved of My heart. It is better for Me. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Trustee! That which was uttered in thy presence must be carried out with the utmost wisdom. When thou passeth through the lands, say \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my Lord, Beloved of my heart, Hope of my soul, and He Who is remembered in my outward and inward being! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which He who sacrificed His life in Thy path, bore tribulations in His love for Thee and the promotion of Thy Cause, to waft over these lands the fragrant breezes of the garment of Thy mercy and Thy favors. O Lord! These are Thy servants and these are Thy lands, though they have been veiled by their desires and thereby prevented from turning toward the court of Thy grace and from drawing nigh unto the Kaaba of Thy knowledge. Yet Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all created things and Whose grace hath encompassed all possibilities. I beseech Thee by Thy Hidden Name which hath been made manifest through Thy sovereignty and which Thou hast made to be the overseer of all who are in Thy earth and heaven, not to leave these souls to their own devices. Send down upon them that which shall cause them to turn toward the direction of Thy favor and to gaze upon Thy countenance. Look upon them, O my God, with the glances of Thy mercy, and take their hands through Thy power and sovereignty. Draw forth, O my God, from the bosom of Thy grace the hand of Thy power, and thereby rend asunder the veils that have come between them and Thee, that all may hasten to the fountain of Thy nearness and circle round Thy will and purpose. If Thou shouldst banish them, who else would deliver them from the fire, O Light of the heavens and earth? And according to the command, should you meet any of the loved ones of God who are oriented toward this direction, you must, on behalf of the True One, bid them return, for the situation in this land has become exceedingly difficult, and without permission they shall achieve no result. This is the firm and decisive command that hath flowed from the Pen of Will, by leave of the Lord of all humanity. And glory be upon him who followeth the Truth and heareth what he hath been commanded.\n\n=== END BH00751 ===\n\n=== START BH00752 ===\n\nIn the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nThe essence of praise and thanksgiving befitteth Him Who, from His Most Glorious Station, hath summoned all creation and guided them through His Self-Subsisting Name. How great the blessedness of those souls whom neither cares and sorrows nor the hosts of the peoples have deterred from the Dayspring of the Most Great Name. They have regarded the world and its varied hues and embellished ornaments as though they had never existed, and have turned with heart and soul toward the Friend. Glory be to God! Every person of understanding is bewildered, every fair-minded one perplexed, and every just one filled with remorse. What has come to pass that people of insight and possessors of reason remain deprived of this most great bounty and supreme grace? Do they possess any proof greater than the proof of God, or any testimony more exalted than that which hath been made manifest? By God, no! All that exists in the world cannot equal a single utterance thereof. To this beareth witness every just and discerning soul. Verily the soul is prone to evil. By God's life! These heedless and rebellious souls are as dried leaves before the winds of self and desire, which carry them whithersoever they list. They have neither rest nor tranquility.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all mankind and in Whose right hand lie the destinies of all in the lands! Thou seest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones at the hands of those who have broken Thy Covenant, turned away from the choice wine of Thy Revelation, and denied what Thou hadst sent down unto them of Thy signs and Thy clear tokens, after they had witnessed the ocean of Thy knowledge and the manifestation of that which Thou hadst explicitly foretold in Thy Books and Tablets. By Thy Self, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations! This servant hath been amazed at Thy patience despite Thy power, and Thy forbearance despite Thy might, though he is assured that nothing proceedeth from Thee save that which Thy wisdom requireth. I beseech Thee to send down upon Thy chosen ones that which shall deliver them from the enemies of Thy Self and make them the inheritors of Thy kingdom, the emblems of Thy victory and the standards of Thy might amidst Thy creation. I moreover beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence, to preserve him whom Thou hast related to Thyself and made one of the twigs of the Tree of Thy Lordship. Then ordain for him that which shall exalt him amongst Thy servants and aid him in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nMy spirit, my soul and my heart be a sacrifice unto your remembrance and unto your steadfastness! Some time ago, a response to your letters along with a reply to the letters of the honored beloved, Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was submitted and sent together with divine Tablets which descended from the Most Holy Heaven specifically for the friends of Sh and A and B. It is hoped these have arrived and that the eyes of the people of God have been honored and blessed with these wondrous and exalted Tablets, that they may become enkindled by the burning fire within the divine words and drink from the hidden oceans concealed therein. Glory be to Him Who hath joined the opposites in His verses and made them one thing! Your honor should hasten in sending the Tablets; the sooner they arrive, the closer it is to piety. Furthermore, three passages specifically regarding the gravestone of the Most Pure Greatest Holy Leaf - upon her be all the most glorious Glory and all the most exalted loftiness - which you had previously requested, were sent. If they find it wise and expedient, they may inscribe any one of them. According to His command, wisdom must be observed in all cases, especially regarding the Afnan, upon them be all the most glorious Glory. This has been repeatedly emphasized. The Command is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. In these days, some friends in various regions have again been instructed to be mindful of protecting the Afnan of the Tree in all conditions. This relates to outward causes. The point is that they have been and are watchful of their Afnan in all circumstances. How blessed are you, a hundred thousand blessings and felicitations be upon you! In view of the repeated supplications of the beloved of the heart, Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be 669, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and likewise regarding the matter of the son, if the beloved Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, should return to Iran, he is permitted. God's favor has been and is with him. He should be engaged in serving the Cause in all circumstances, whether in Iraq or Hijaz or other lands. The protection of children is emphasized by God. And regarding what you had written about having sent a letter to Sarkar Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise his reply - when these details were submitted in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, He said: \"We beseech God to assist him in that which will exalt his mention, his name and His Cause, and to give him to drink from the cup of My good-pleasure, which God hath placed above all stations.\" Additionally, the recommendation you had written regarding Haji Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, was received. They specifically summoned him from Beirut. During days when meeting was somewhat difficult, nevertheless he was repeatedly blessed with attaining the presence, and afterwards he was given leave to return. He hath attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He came with the spirit and returned with fragrance, through a command from God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed is he and joy be unto him.\n\nAnother submission: On the 22nd day of Rabi'u'th-Thani, the spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Shukru'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived at the Most Great Prison and attained the supreme honor and greatest gift. Praise be to God, the veils of hindrance were rent asunder and he achieved his heart's desire. This is naught but from His supreme bounty, His prevenient mercy, and His all-encompassing grace. The details about the trees that were sent will surely be mentioned by him. In truth, he himself is like a tree - God willing, he will appear with sweet fruits. They said: \"Blessed is he who sent it and blessed is he, for what he hath done in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath been accepted before the Wronged One.\" Although the wild rose did not arrive, the deed of the sender and his honor are accepted before God - meaning there is no difference whether it arrived or not. May my spirit and the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of utterance be a sacrifice for His bounty! This much is submitted: that his honor has in no way fallen short, and the ultimate aim and effort was to reach the Source. However, of what that eminence sent, two items arrived. From his honor, the Beloved of the Heart, Shaykh 'Al, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, outwardly it did not arrive, but it truly did arrive, for the Tongue of Grandeur has testified and it was accepted before God. It behooveth us to praise, thank and glorify our Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. The Glory shining from the heaven of our Lord's providence be upon your honor, those with you, and those who have arisen and spoken what they were commanded by God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nThe Servant\n\n5 Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1301\n\nAdditionally it is submitted: If his honor, the honored beloved Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God, has departed - that is, to another city of the lands - there is and was no harm in it, and it will not be fruitless. And if he returns, in consideration of the wish of his honor, the honored, revered beloved Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, that too is acceptable. However, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ordain for those lands that which is the cause of success and prosperity. Verily, He has power over all things. Another submission: Multiple packets have previously been sent; God willing, they have arrived by now.\n\n=== END BH00752 ===\n\n=== START BH00753 ===\n\nHe is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!\n\nPraise be fitting and worthy unto the Lord of all desires, Who confirmed that soul in turning towards Him, in drawing nigh, in rendering victorious aid and in teaching His Cause, and Who, through His blessed word \"The Kingdom is Mine,\" made manifest the tokens of the Hour and the mysteries of the Resurrection. His is the praise and the glorification, His the gratitude and the splendor. From the first days thou didst turn unto Him and didst drink from the cup of confession before the faces of the chosen ones and the wicked. With complete steadfastness thou didst arise to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings. In days when vain imaginings deprived all from the Most Exalted Horizon, with the finger of certitude thou didst rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, and with the arm of assurance thou didst break the backs of the idols. We beseech God to aid thee at all times with wondrous and fresh confirmations, that He may render all thy deeds as a single remembrance before thy Lord, and that there may waft from them that which shall guide mankind unto Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nSome time ago, the Name of Generosity, upon him be My glory, forwarded thy letter to the Wronged One. We found in it that which caused the countenance of love to smile. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O thou who hast drunk the wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, it calleth thee as a grace from His presence and maketh mention of thee as a mercy from His side. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nO Samandar! Reflect upon the power of God, exalted be His glory, and likewise upon the manifestations of suppositions and idle fancies. The Most Exalted Herald, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - hath declared: \"I have written the essence concerning His mention: He shall not be known through My allusions, nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan.\" Would that they had comprehended this one utterance and held fast unto it! Given this decisive and binding word which, as attested by God, is the essence of the Bayan - is it permissible that the people of the Bayan should today remain veiled and heedless of its Revealer and Sender? Every fair-minded person in these days chooseth silence that he may hearken to the flow of the Supreme Pen, from which the fragrance of God's Cause is diffused. The Primal Point in the highest realm uttereth the blessed words \"Verily, I am the first to worship.\" Say: O people! Fear God, behold His horizon, then hearken to His call. His mention cannot be confused with the mentions of the world, nor what hath appeared from Him with what hath appeared among the nations. The heaven of divine proof is today adorned with the suns of wisdom and utterance and the stars of commandments and ordinances. Turn ye unto them and be not of those who turn aside. This Most Great Revelation hath ever been all-encompassing, not encompassed. The Herald hath mentioned that which hath no likeness or equal, and from His own manifestation and appearance His supreme purpose was to exalt this Word. This is mentioned in one station, while in another station \"None knoweth it save Him.\" This is the truth, there is no doubt therein. By God, the Truth! This Most Great Cause and Supreme Proof hath never needed anything to establish Its manifestation. The ocean of utterance is manifest before the faces of all religions, and the sun of proof shineth resplendent above all heads. The Ultimate Tree appeareth with wondrous and sublime fruits and fresh and delicate leaves. Say: Cast aside that which withholdeth you from God, the Lord of all worlds, and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by One powerful, knowing, and wise. Today the Bayan is contingent and dependent upon the acceptance of this Most Great Revelation. Verily We sent down for Our Herald that which brought solace to the eyes of God's Books, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. We sent it to Him, and when it came before Him and He read it, He was so transported by the breezes of revelation that He soared wholly in My atmosphere and sought to attain My presence. The verses stirred Him in such wise that no pen and ink, no tongue can ever recount it. To this the Mother Book beareth witness in the final return. We have veiled the root of the Cause to preserve it, as a wisdom from Our presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and shall not be asked of what He willeth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Samandar! The earthworms of clay were never worthy of ascent and soaring, and the former people, namely the Shi'ites, were in truth reared on suppositions and idle fancies. By My life! They were not and are not aware of any matter. Until now the mysteries of revelation are not known. Through a single name and word did the religion of Islam become weakened and slip away. O Samandar! The Letters of every revelation must be present in the days of manifestation and attain the honor of meeting. Reflect, then conceal, and be of those who preserve. Until now they have not understood the meaning of unity. It behooveth Us to leave off their mention and mention that which causeth the mountains to quake, let alone human beings. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nKnow ye that mention was made of souls who have desired to turn towards the Most Great Ocean. O Samandar! Eyes and ears that are worthy and capable of witnessing and hearing are as rare as red sulphur. Yet there is hope that through your sincerity and arising to serve the Cause, the Word may penetrate and guide the servants to the highest horizon. We beseech God to aid them to understand the Shi'ih faction and their deeds and words that oppose God's Cause, for if any soul attains to this station, he will find himself firm and steadfast, such that names will not hold him back from the Truth, nor will the false tales of the past deprive him. Make mention of each of the friends in that land on behalf of the Wronged One. All are and have been beneath the glances of His favor. We beseech God to assist them to promote His Cause with wisdom and utterance, and to send down upon them from the heaven of His bounty that which will draw them nigh unto Him. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWhen thou art stirred by the rapture of My call, turn towards My direction and say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest my turning unto Thee, my clinging fast, my orientation and my attachment. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Firm Handle and by the hem of the robe of Thy bounty, O Lord of all beings, and by the light of Thy Cause whereby earth and heaven were illumined, to make me at all times turned towards Thy horizon, speaking Thy praise, and promoting Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance. Thou art verily the Mighty, the Bestower. O my Lord! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge, then open the doors of their hearts with the keys of Thy bounty and generosity. O my Lord! Thou seest them wandering in the atmosphere of perplexity and error. Deliver them through Thy name, the All-Powerful, and save them through Thy name, the Almighty. Then aid them, O my God, through Thy signs and evidences, make known to them Thy path, and teach them that which will raise them to the heaven of Thy might and acceptance. Thou art verily the Omnipotent Whom the veils of the transgressors cannot withhold, nor the turning away of the opposers, nor the gloating of the gleeful. Thou art verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThou didst mention meeting with Haji Mirza Abu'l-Fadl. O Samandar! In the days when the Most Great Luminary was dawning and shining from the horizon of the heaven of the Land of Mystery, after the sending of Tablets and the revelation of verses, Mulla Isma'il sent a letter to the servant who was present, wherein he acknowledged and confessed his recognition of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then he uttered these unworthy and unbecoming words, saying that were he to proclaim this station in the Land of Qaf, Mulla Hadi would cut off his bread. Consider now how the Most Pure and Abha Hearing could receive such words. Yet for the sake of God, We heard them and commanded patience and forbearance. A most mighty and holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace and sent in response to Aqa Siyyid Musa, upon him be the Glory of God, that he might find therefrom the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return.\n\n=== END BH00753 ===\n\n=== START BH00754 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, Lord of Earth and Heaven!\n\nPraise befitteth the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of the Desired One, Who hath made manifest the secrets of hearts and revealed that which lay hidden in the innermost minds. Alas! Alas! for that which hath befallen the Embodiment of sanctity, detachment, trustworthiness and fidelity! The arrows of greed, avarice and passion have assailed Him. That soul, despite the love shown by the Afnan, hath committed that which causeth every trustworthy one to lament and every truthful one to weep. We counseled with trustworthiness; he responded with treachery. We exhorted with truth; he adorned himself with falsehood. He transformed justice into tyranny and trustworthiness into betrayal through his deeds. Every conscious one is bewildered by the heedlessness of that negligent soul. The seat of love hath become the manifestation of enmity, and the place of gratitude hath turned to complaint. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist all to that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to make known unto them that which shall profit them and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nThe letter of Mirza Abdul-Karim, upon him be the peace of God, was perused, and the fragrance of love was wafted from its words, and likewise did the light of steadfastness shine forth. And from the latter portion of the letter of his honor Fadl, upon him be God's peace and loving-kindness, it was evident that he hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath spoken in praise of his Lord. That which was mentioned concerning the martyrdom of the departed one was heard. Blessed is he in that God gave him to drink a draught from the cup of fidelity, and a portion from the chalice of detachment, and a drink from the ocean of martyrdom. At the time of his ascension, the holy souls and illumined realities welcomed him after the lights of pardon and forgiveness had encompassed him. Joy be unto him and unto those who remember him and will remember him with goodness. Verily God is the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nThe cause of the manifestation of this matter was the events that occurred in Muharram. After the incident took place, that which they have mentioned regarding informing the government and ruler of the country was acceptable. It is necessary for those in authority to be informed of such matters. However, in questions and answers it should be said that we were and are true Muslims, but there is a difference that has arisen, namely that we were promised the appearance of a Qa'im from among the descendants of the Prophet. And this group known as Babis say that His Holiness has appeared, while a faction among the Islamic sects who consider themselves Shi'ih deny this Manifestation and say that He must appear from the imaginary Jabulqa and Jabulsa - which are names of two cities - with fabricated signs. This matter became the cause of discord, and that Qa'im \\[the Bab\\] Whose appearance we accepted was martyred, and this incident became the cause of universal hatred and rancor. In the early years, repeated conflicts and disputes occurred in Iran. That Qa'im gave us glad tidings of the appearance of the Name of the Self-Subsisting, Who would appear afterwards. This blessed Manifestation strictly forbade all from conflict and dispute in the Book, and firmly commanded in the Tablets association and love with all religions. As He hath revealed in the Most Holy Book: \"Consort with all religions with amity and concord.\" In another place He hath said: \"To be killed is better for you than to kill.\" And likewise in Persian He saith: If you possess a precious pearl or an exalted jewel, show it and present it. If it is accepted, the purpose is achieved; if not, leave it with him and pray for him, but do not treat him unkindly.\n\nNow it is nearly forty years that conflict and dispute have been entirely removed through God's grace and favor. During these successive years, in every land they have repeatedly martyred ones from this oppressed community, yet they did not retaliate and left it to God. The martyrdom of this oppressed one which occurred in these days is a true testimony to the oppression of this community and the tyranny of the enemies. This oppressed community seeks from God comfort, bounty, glory and well-being for all, yet the enemies in response have been and are engaged in killing and plunder. Now we beseech God, exalted be His glory, to manifest a helper and protector for this oppressed community. Verily He hath power over all things. And the cause of this killing \\[...\\]\n\nSome of the divines of Iran have, without any evidence or proof, issued death sentences against this community. However, His Majesty the Shah of Iran - may the All-Merciful strengthen him - has for several years refrained from molesting this community, and has indeed protected them, and on various occasions has safeguarded this community from the evil of the ignorant. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid His Majesty in protecting the oppressed from the rising places of tyranny and injustice. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nAs for the mention of 'Akka alone, it suffices. Repeatedly during the month of Muharram these events occurred. At the time of departure from Iraq, We counselled all to observe wisdom and that which would lead to the prosperity and success of all. However, after the Wronged One's arrival in the great city during the month of Muharram, some acted in ways that caused great commotion. For the generality of people, not having attained even a drop from the ocean of knowledge, imagine - God forbid - that this community's beliefs or their love for that Holy Being has diminished or weakened. Far be it! Rather, the joy of those days relates to their belief that the Imams have returned and appeared, in accordance with Shi'ih belief, for among the authenticated traditions is that at the appearance of the Qa'im, the Imams of the Qur'an will arise from their graves and appear. They are unaware that in these days another Cause has appeared and the hidden treasure has been revealed.\n\nSuch actions are not permissible in days like these, for they are contrary to wisdom. Most people are heedless and veiled from the Truth, oblivious to it and focused on themselves. Therefore, that which causes separation is not beloved in God's sight, for separation leads to estrangement and remoteness. Be patient, O people of justice! Soon days will come when all shall understand the purpose and arise to serve. The honored martyr, whom the mercy of his Lord encompassed from all directions, due to the effulgences of the light of love and the revelations of the radiance of affection, did not observe wisdom as was befitting, and thus occurred what occurred. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.\n\nToday one must hold fast to that which causes the attraction and orientation of the servants. O friends of God! Hold fast to that which draws hearts and souls. Deeds that cause upheaval and kindle the fire of hatred are not permissible and are not acceptable. This Revelation is for the union of all, not separation. What has appeared thus far has been and is without harm, and the steadfastness of some souls has become manifest. We beseech the Truth to confirm all in all conditions. What is needed today is the unity and agreement of the friends. All must exert mighty efforts in this regard. We have made mention of the friends of that land, but due to wisdom it was not sent. We shall send it soon. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nPeace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who act according to what they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O My loved ones! Observing wisdom and obedience to government are among God's binding commands. Hold fast to them, as bidden by One Who is a sincere counselor, trustworthy.\n\n=== END BH00754 ===\n\n=== START BH00755 ===\n\nPort Said. May His Eminence the honored and esteemed Afnan, His Eminence Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon whom be \\[Baha'u'llah's\\] Most Glorious \\[glory\\], behold this through his blessed gaze.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise befitteth and beseemeth the Lord of all beings, Who on the Day of Return, without veil or covering, summoned the peoples to the most exalted horizon and from the hand of bounty bestowed the water of everlasting life upon the inhabitants of the mortal realm. Every soul who turned unto Him attained the chalice of recognition, and every denier was deprived. He is the Just One Who, through the balance of reward and punishment, bestowed freshness and radiance upon the world of justice. Exalted be His grandeur and manifest His proof. There is no God but Him. And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the world and the Cause of the existence of nations, through Whom God sent down the Criterion and through Whom He distinguished between truth and falsehood until the Day of Resurrection, and upon His family and companions, through whom the foundation of religion was strengthened and the strong cord of God was made manifest. Whoso holdeth fast unto them hath indeed held fast unto God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nMay my spirit be sacrificed for your remembrance, your utterance, your arising and your steadfastness. Your blessed letter, which was a clear book in the remembrance of God, the Lord of the worlds, was received and in the sanctuary of the heart released the fragrance of meanings and perfumed the pillars, for it was adorned with that which was the purpose of the creation of the world - His remembrance. Well done to your pen and your ink! After reading and becoming aware, We approached the Presence and attained the honor of being heard. He said: \"O Afnan! Upon you be the peace of God, His grace and His mercy. In these days there has occurred that which causes the greatest sorrow. That Afnan, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, bears witness that this Wronged One has, in most Tablets, commanded the servants to trustworthiness, religiosity, chastity and fidelity. However, the heedless did not accept the counsel of the Wronged One. They passed by what is right and clung to what is wrong. The tempests of self and passion move them. The unfair one in the great city tore the veil of honor and did that which caused the pillars of trustworthiness and religion to shake, despite being shown kindness and assistance and being aided by God's command. Glory be to God! The fire of greed and avarice appeared with a strange flame in that city, burning away spiritual qualities, and in its place the fire of envy was kindled. O Afnan! I do not complain of My grief and sorrow, and I remain content with what has befallen Me from the oppression of the oppressors and the turning away of the ones who turned away. Glory be to God! Some souls strive and struggle for their own completion, but are unaware. We commanded all to that which elevates human stations in the contingent world, yet they did that which caused the people of the cities of remembrance and utterance to lament. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them to return and to make known to them what they have lost. From them has appeared oppression in place of justice, tyranny in place of equity, and the fire of unfaithfulness in place of fidelity. That Afnan and those with him and the friends of God, exalted be His glory, must gaze toward the horizon of forgiveness and bounty and beseech for creation that which is the cause of eternal salvation. Convey greetings to the Afnan on behalf of the Wronged One. Let them not be saddened by exile. Praise be to God, they have turned to Him and taken residence in the vicinity. We beseech God to open before his face the door of His grace. Verily, He has power over all things. His Honor the Overseer, upon him be God's peace, has hastily departed from the source of corruption and chosen flight over staying. The cause of the hatred and enmity of some in the great city is not known - what it was and how it arose. In any case, the station of mention is, we seek refuge in God. Convey greetings to the friends of that land on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Watchful, the Near.\" End.\n\nIn truth, the affairs that occurred in the Great City have become a cause of astonishment. People's wealth has been scattered to the wind, a great injustice has been inflicted upon justice, and the severest blow has been dealt to religion. I beseech God to protect His loved ones from the harm of those souls. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth. That which this servant never imagined has come to pass. One who had been shown the utmost kindness, and whose outward affairs had been arranged according to his wishes, nevertheless, solely due to vain imaginings and suspicions, committed that which caused harm and grief to the Station. All that your honor wrote regarding these matters and dealings of the person in question is the truth, without doubt. After it was presented, He smiled and said: \"Excellent is what the Afnan (upon him be My peace) hath done.\" However, in the Great City he has practiced deception with the friends of God. Moderation with such souls is not permissible, for whatever moderation was shown to heedless souls in that land, they have written it differently and sent it to this land. It seems they were created from sheer heedlessness and absolute hatred. Complaints about those souls have come from all directions. According to reports, he has made purchases for some that were contrary to religion and trustworthiness. Praise be to God that his share of deceit, trickery and cunning had no effect on your honor. Whatever you wrote to him was repeatedly presented, and each time it was presented, joy and gladness were manifested. Praise be to God that the Afnan was protected from the arrow of that heedless one's treachery. He never thought there would be found in the world a soul who would remain protected from his deception and cunning. Praise be to God Who protected the Afnan from his evil and his cunning, and answered him in what was befitting. Verily He is the Protector, the Trustworthy.\n\nIn truth, this servant was greatly pleased by your honor's letter. The meaning of the blessed verse \"And they planned, and God planned, and God is the best of planners\" became manifest. That heedless one committed that which is not permissible to mention. In nights and days he associated with the enemy of God. For four years patience was shown and the name \"Concealer\" prevailed, but the lamentation of truthfulness, the cry of trustworthiness, and the wail of chastity removed the veil and revealed the reality of that soul. His injustice reached such a point that the hand of power revealed his deeds and uncovered them. Verily He is the Avenger, the Just, the Wise.\n\nTo the presence of the honored Qurratu'l-'Ayn of the near ones, the Afnan (upon him be the peace of the All-Merciful and His favors), I convey greetings. Praise be to God, he is blessed with the greatest favors and is mentioned before Him Who is Mentioned. To the beloved of the heart, the honored Nazir (upon him be God's peace and grace), I convey greetings, and I beseech God for him that which is the cause of joy and the source of happiness. Likewise to the other friends who are present with your honor, I convey greetings to each one, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for blessings, bounty and steadfastness for them. Verily He is the Giver, the Generous. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you and hear your word for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThe Servant\n\n29 Ramadan 1306\n\nHe said to write to the Afnan that if possible, they should send several drinking glasses.\n\n=== END BH00755 ===\n\n=== START BH00756 ===\n\nIn Port Said. May the honored Afnan, his eminence Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] the Most Glorious, be favored with the most luminous gaze.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!\n\nIn every moment of all moments, the successive and continuous blessings of the Desired One are manifest and evident. Existence is from Him, health is from Him, manifest, and bounty descends from Him, and protection through the hosts of His means is resplendent. Were details to be mentioned, pen and ink would find themselves impotent. With all these favors, gifts and bounties, each of which requires a hundred thousand thanks, how can one tongue suffice and fulfill its gratitude? Thus it is proven by demonstration: the impotence of servants and the admission of inadequacy. Every fair-minded one bears witness to what has been mentioned.\n\nO God, O Generous One, O Merciful One! I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath conquered all created things, and by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all existence, to ordain for every particle of Thy creation a speaking tongue in Thy remembrance, praise, and thanksgiving for Thy bounties and favors. My God, my Lord, and my Support! I beseech Thee by the confession of those near unto Thee and the unitarians, and by the acknowledgment of the sincere ones and the mystics, and by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy attributes and names, to assist Thy servants in that which befitteth Thy pardon, Thy bestowal, Thy mercy and Thy power. O Lord! Thou art the Strong, the Powerful, and Thy servants are weak and poor. Adorn them with the ornament of Thy strength and power. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice for your mention, your arising, and your steadfastness! Your letter arrived and truly wondrous effects were evident from it - the glad tidings of health and the transformation of sorrows and griefs into joy and delight, and furthermore awareness and knowledge of affairs. Blessed be God, it possessed both outward and inward bounties, and truly for this poor one it was a spiritual wealth in the realm of knowledge. Praise be to God, it conveyed degrees of love, affection, favor and mercy. After its reading and review, approach was made to the Presence, it was presented before His face and achieved the honor of His listening. He said that the mention and utterance of the Afnan, upon him be God's peace and favor, is the cause of gladness and joy. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him in guiding His creation, exalting His Word, and manifesting that which adorns the servants with His attributes. O My Afnan! Upon thee be God's peace and bounty. Thou art remembered on the carpet of the Wronged One and art the recipient of special favor. Thy mention was adorned with His hearing. Praise be to God, each word thereof was like a muezzin who, from a lofty and elevated station, summoned people to the gathering place. Despite the radiant favors, manifest bounties, and brilliant bestowals, some persist in opposition and deny what is manifest. Say:\n\nO my God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy justice and their temples with the ornament of Thy forgiveness. O Lord! Prevent them not from turning to the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy grace. Thou art the One with power through Thy sovereignty, before which neither the dominion of the world nor the might of nations can stand. O Lord! Assist Thy Afnan through Thy bounty and generosity, then open before his face the doors of Thy grace and mercy - that whereby he may become known through Thy name, mighty through Thy might, and obeyed through Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nWe make mention of the son and give him the glad tidings of God's loving-kindness and favors. Give him My greetings from the Wronged One and remind him of what hath been uttered in this irrevocable Tablet. We make mention of him who hath been adorned with the love of God and His loved ones, and We beseech God to aid His loved ones to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Munificent, the One possessed of manifest grace. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nPraise be to God! His successive favors are evident and manifest. Mention of that honored one hath been made at all times, and bounties and favors have been revealed in such wise that this servant is unable to describe them. That honored one knoweth and will know. As for the account of the land of Shin, it appeareth that the Siyyid of that land's inattention hath caused an uproar to arise. His Holiness Afnan (upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious) sent a petition to the Most Holy Court, and likewise a letter to this evanescent servant, and this was before the arrival of the Blessed Tablet. The turmoil in that land was the cause. Now a letter containing verses and clear proofs hath been sent to the spiritual friend, His Honor Haji Ghulam-Husayn Kh-A (upon him be the peace of God). It will reach that honored one's attention; let him consider it and send it on. We beseech and hope from the Intended One the improvement of that honored one's affairs. Assuredly any attention that is given for the sake of God will have its effect and its wisdom will become manifest. The affairs of His Holiness Afnan of the land of Shin (upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious) have apparently suffered somewhat due to the disorder in the affairs of certain other Afnans (upon them be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness), as their sudden movement during the rainy season and their physical illness prove what hath been submitted. Indeed they have borne a great burden in that at such a time they have turned their attention to that land for attending to affairs and occupations. This servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His Holiness and to aid him and to set right his affairs as a mercy from His presence and a favor from His court. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. There is no God but He, the Hearing, the Seeing.\n\nThere was a passage in the blessed supreme letter that caused much smiling from the Master (may our spirits be sacrificed for Him). It was repeatedly presented and successive favors were evident and manifest. Indeed all passages of the letter were the cause of joy and gladness. We beseech God, blessed and exalted is He, to manifest through you that which will gladden the hearts of the world and bring solace to the eyes of the nations. Verily He is the Answerer, the Choose One.\n\nThat which was written mentioning the spiritual friend, His Honor Haji Niyaz Effendi (upon him be the Glory of God), was presented before His countenance and achieved the honor of His hearing. Now praise be to God, they are present in the vicinity and speak in remembrance of that honored one, and the supreme favor is evident and manifest toward them. It is hoped that they will ever be adorned with this bounty and illumined with this light. He said: \"Niyaz is truly in need.\" God willing, may the divine will manifest that which is the cause of true wealth.\n\nThe tin tube with its inner contents, that is to say the pieces, arrived.\n\nI send greetings unto his honor the Afnan, the Most Luminous Star and Most Brilliant Orb, upon him be the peace and glory of God. I offer congratulations and hope that through the grace of the All-Bountiful One he may attain to all that conduceth to exaltation and elevation. Likewise unto the other friends who are illumined by the light of certitude and enkindled with the fire of love do I send greetings, and I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, on their behalf whatsoever causeth the exaltation of His Word. The Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto the dust before their feet - and the dwellers of the Pavilion of Sanctity and Grandeur make mention of that honored one in the most exalted station, sending salutations, praise, glory and splendor. They ceaselessly beseech the Most High on behalf of that honored one whatsoever is sanctified and elevated above all comparison and likeness. Verily our Lord is the All-Hearing, the Answerer of Prayer. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. Peace and remembrance and mercy and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and upon those who love you and hearken unto your words, for the sake of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. And praise be unto Him, for He is the Protector of the sincere ones and the Lord of all the worlds. \\[Servant\\] On the 28th of Dhi'l-Qa'dah \\[the Sacred\\] 1307\n\n=== END BH00756 ===\n\n=== START BH00757 ===\n\nMay my contemplation be blessed with the gaze of my Lord and Beloved, the Most Exalted Name 66, upon him be all the most glorious glory. He is God, exalted be His station of grandeur and power.\n\nMy spirit and being be a sacrifice unto Thee, then my innermost essence and identity be a sacrifice unto Thee. Days have passed wherein this evanescent servant has not been blessed with the fragrant breezes of thy letter and the sweet-scented emanations flowing from the pen of thy grace and favor. Were I to reckon each hour thereof as a thousand years, I would be truthful in this utterance, for when the seeker is separated from his Beloved even for less than a moment, he accounts it as a thousand ages, and even this is little compared to the burning thirst of love for thy countenance and the yearning for thy presence. We beseech God to pour forth patience upon me in all conditions, verily He is the Guardian of the patient ones.\n\nFurthermore, I submit that for some time I have not been honored with the traces of thy blessed pen. Several blessed letters arrived in succession, and this servant was honored with them all and submitted replies. God willing, they have arrived by now. No new developments have occurred except that his honor Ismullah-i-Asdaq, upon him be the glory of God, has, according to instructions, turned towards the Most Holy Court and is now dwelling in peace under the shadow of the Beloved of the worlds. Likewise, his honor Haji Abdul-Rahim and his son, upon them both be the glory of God, have, as instructed, proceeded from Tabriz to the Most Holy Court and are now dwelling under the shadow of His grace. Furthermore, his honor Nabil of Qa'in, upon him be the glory of God, has reached Mosul and has paused there, seeking permission to attain the presence. Permission has been granted from the Source of Command for him to proceed to the Most Holy Court or to the Land of Ha, as deemed appropriate by your honor, and indeed your honor's judgment in this matter was most wise. We beseech God to assist all to serve His Cause.\n\nAlso, Haji Hassan from Q along with two persons from Kalih-Darih and family have arrived at the Most Holy Court and are dwelling in its shadow. They had received partial permission in previous years and, holding to this, they proceeded. Likewise, his honor Samandar and Haji Nasir, upon them be the glory of God, have proceeded with permission and have arrived in Aliyyih, intending to reach the Most Holy Court. According to reports, numerous souls are on the way without permission, having resolved to come. I beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, to assist this servant and the friends and lovers of His eternal Beauty - this is not difficult for Him.\n\nFurthermore, another news is that the matter of the seven persons has apparently become difficult, as some in the Administrative Council of Damascus have risen in religious opposition, while others out of greed that worldly ornaments do not suffice. From the Pen of God, regarding this matter, a word was previously revealed: \"He became hungry while his teeth were upon heaps.\" Indeed, this blessed word was specifically revealed about these souls. In all matters we place our trust in God.\n\nConcerning Haji Hassan, that which His Holiness arranged has been accepted before the throne. God has forgiven what is past; verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. From that which was revealed from the Supreme Pen in the glorious Tablet specifically revealed and sent to His Holiness - the attention of that beloved one to various regions has borne abundant fruits, and in every place the name of God has been upraised. Sometimes in Iraq it was heard from the blessed tongue that they would say that His Honor Haji Siyyid Kazim - may the Most Glorious Beauty of God rest upon him - had written to the Bab - may all glory in its most glorious be upon Him - \"What concern is it if the wall of the community should fall, when thou art its support,\" and so forth. And it is hoped that all lands which bear accepted souls and have remained parched from the dryness of the winds of fancy will become verdant and flourishing through the outpourings of the rains of mystical knowledge of that beloved one. We beseech the Most High to assist us in serving His Cause and in manifesting what hath been revealed in His Tablets, and to make us among those who are steadfast in His remembrance and praise. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAnother matter is that His Honor Aqa Abdul-Hussein - upon him be the Glory of God - arrived from the regions and sent a petition to the Most Holy Court stating that this servant desires to go to Mecca and is now determined, if permission from the Source of Greatest Bounty is granted, even if for one hour, to attain the honor of meeting, otherwise to proceed to the aforementioned destination. Therefore permission was given and they came and attained what God desired. Blessed be he, again blessed be he. However, they had no letter from His Honor Ismu'llah Ha - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. When asked about this, they mentioned that \"I went to his presence and he said 'Since you have no permission, I will not give a letter.'\" The truth is with him, but since the aforementioned person had the intention for Mecca, therefore permission was given and no blame is upon him. I testify that he is among the successful ones.\n\nMay I be thy sacrifice! At this time when the petition reached this station, two holy, adorned, beautified and illumined books from that beloved one arrived like two pure tables. Praise be to God, this servant was in utmost appetite and the bounty was in the highest degree of grace and purity. We kept eating and kept giving thanks. And what bounty it was - a perfect bounty! How could it not be, when it was cooked in the breasts of words with the fire of love for the Revealer of Verses and sent from the Beloved to the yearning, burning, eager and hungry one.\n\nWhat was written regarding the matter of sustenance of His Honor Aqa Siyyid Javad - upon him be the Glory of God - was greatly accepted before the throne, and His Honor Jud will surely present the details himself. We ask God to unite their gathering and set right their affairs. The details of this matter are very delightful if His Honor Aqa'i Aqa Siyyid Javad presents them completely. And further, this blessed word has risen from the Source of the Cause: \"If this land becomes settled,\" whenever it happens and someone from that land turns toward the Most Holy Court, Fatimah Bigum - upon her be the Glory of God - should be remembered in that caravan and turn toward the Most Holy Court.\n\nMay I be thy sacrifice! The journey of that beloved one has become very long. Specifically they said: \"His journey and absence have been prolonged. The time of his nearness and presence has come.\" \\[...\\]\n\nA blessed and exalted Tablet has descended from the heaven of grace and special favors of that Beloved One. Since the original revelation was in pieces and its sending was not possible, this servant has copied and sent it from the original. God willing, they will attain unto it. What else can be submitted? Out of longing, yearning, attraction and sincerity, each one of the beloved ones offers, individually, pure devotion and nothingness to His Presence. The Two Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Mighty Branches - may my spirit and the spirits of all the worlds be sacrificed for the dust of their blessed footsteps - remember His Presence with special, special, special mention and convey wondrous, exalted, Most Glorious greetings. Likewise, the Afnan of the Divine Lote-Tree and their branches convey Most Holy, Most Glorious greetings. The Maidens of the Sanctuary and the dwellers of the pavilion of the glory of the Ancient Beauty, in the Most Holy Court which is sanctified from the mention and indication of all created things, remember that Beloved One with glorious mention. Upon you be glory, what glory! Glory before which the Supreme Spirit and the spirits of all the Prophets and Messengers would sacrifice themselves.\n\nServant\n\n23 Muharram 91\n\n=== END BH00757 ===\n\n=== START BH00758 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nGlorified be He Who created all beings to ascend unto the heaven of His knowledge and commanded them to unite for the exaltation of His Word and the tranquility of His servants. Verily He, exalted be His glory, hath desired unity for the manifestation of gathering, and the manifestation of gathering for the promotion of mutual aid amongst them and the ordering of their affairs as befitteth them. He is the Sovereign Who hath prescribed for His creation that which shall profit them in all the worlds of His worlds. I beseech Him, exalted be He, and say:\n\nMy God, my God! Aid them to accomplish what Thou hast desired for them in Thy perspicuous Book and Thy mighty Tablet. O Lord! Make known unto them that which will exalt them, assist them, and preserve them from that which is unworthy of them. Verily, Thou art the All-Merciful, the All-Wise, the Gracious Commander.\n\nAnd peace and blessings be upon Him through Whom the kingdom of earth and heaven was adorned, and through Whom was revealed that which lay hidden in His all-encompassing knowledge of what was and what is to be, and upon His family and companions, the dawning-places of might and the manifestations of the power of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nAnd then, O beloved of my heart, thy distinguished letter, which was like a fruitful tree, arrived. Praise be to God, its root is firmly established in the soil of love and its fruit is present before our face. We eat and we praise, we eat and we give thanks. A hundred thousand tongues and a hundred thousand beings would be needed to perhaps fulfill the obligation of gratitude for it. But alas, alas! Reason declareth this to be an unworthy utterance - what hath dust to do with the Lord of Lords? Therefore submission and the admission of powerlessness are befitting, and I say:\n\nI ask Thy forgiveness, O God of earth and heaven, for that which my tongue hath uttered and my pen hath written. Thou seest, O my God, how from every hair of my being are raised the hands of my hope toward the heaven of Thy pardon, Thy bounty, Thy mercy and Thy favors. Do not, O my God, send them back disappointed and at a loss. Take them through Thy generosity, for verily Thou art the Munificent, the All-Generous.\n\nAnd after reading and becoming informed, I proceeded to the Most Holy Court where it was presented before the countenance of my Lord and was honored to be heard. He said: \"O Amin, upon thee be the peace and favor of God. In all conditions we must offer praise and thanksgiving to God, glorified be His majesty, for He hath, from the ocean of generosity and the heaven of bounty, adorned His loved ones amidst the peoples with the ornament of trustworthiness, truthfulness and sincerity, and guided them to the straight path - that is, the most upright path - that is, the most firm, clear and strong path. Jest in speech is as salt in food.\" Say:\n\n\"Praise be to Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, for having sent down the blessing of Thy utterance and manifested the pearls of the ocean of Thy grace. I testify that through Thy will Thou hast opened the doors of generosity upon existence and the gates of bounty upon the world. I beseech Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of proof and in Whose right hand is the dominion of certitude, by Thy hosts that have appeared from Thy Most Exalted Pen and by its influence in the world of creation, to ordain for me and Thy loved ones that which will exalt us through Thy Name and preserve us from the evil of Thine enemies. O Lord! Aid us to cling fast to Thy will and to hold to the hem of Thy decree. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful, the Merciful, the All-Bestowing.\"\n\nO Trustee of God! Praise be to God that thou wert assisted in delivering that wronged and oppressed one, namely the Trust of God, for that helpless one was, like this Wronged One in the prison of ?a, bound in fetters and chains for a long time due to the oppression of the oppressors and the calumnies of the slanderers. In any case, through God's assistance - glorified be His majesty - that wronged one was delivered. The visit of the honored Afnan and yourself to the Holy Threshold hath momentous consequences and mention thereof shall be immortalized in the Book. This is of His great bounty and His supreme loving-kindness. Rejoice at these glad tidings through which the decree of joy and gladness was made manifest among the servants of God and His loved ones. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends of that land. By the life of God, they were and are remembered in the arena of imprisonment. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for them the good of this world and the next, and to decree for them the reward of those who stood before the Seat of Justice and spoke that whereby the scrolls of truth and fairness were spread abroad. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nMention was made of the honored Afnan and the friends, and likewise of the zeal and dignity of A. and ?., upon them be greetings. Praise be to God, they have attained unto the essence of knowledge and deeds, certitude and recognition. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him and his loved ones and strengthen them to remember Him, praise Him, and manifest His attributes throughout the duration of the earthly realm and the Kingdom. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nAnd as to thy repeated mention of the son of S.M., upon them both be greetings - this is a bounty from God. The people of that house have been favored with recognition and service from the beginning of the Cause. In those days which were as dark as night, when the intensity of wrath was directed from every side - now ask thou God to protect them and preserve them from whatsoever is unworthy of His days. Verily, He is the Generous, the Lord of great bounty, and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nHow can tongue and pen fulfill their task? How can a drop reach the ocean, or an atom the sun? Praise be to God, all are assisted and favored with His grace. This grace hath ever been, and shall ever be, sanctified above any likeness or comparison. Well is it with them that have attained! These days, letters have arrived from Iran, each adorned with mention of that Beloved of hearts. Specifically, a letter arrived from Ibn-i-'A??ar (may God's mercy be upon him), upon him be the Glory of God, wherein he wrote about a trust that was in his possession. After being presented before His presence, the command was issued that some should be delivered to the friends of that land and some should be sent to that Beloved of hearts.\n\nAs to what thou didst write concerning Aqa Ra?matu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God - praise be to God, the glad tidings of permission reached him, and now, praise be to God, it is several days that he is present and circumambulating. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him and all who are on earth to do what He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Fulfiller of the needs of all humanity. His companion hath also come. Praise be to God, there is a gathering present. In these days permission to return hath been granted. Praise be to God, the purpose was achieved and they attained unto the blessing of pilgrimage.\n\nAnd regarding the affairs, they should, as commanded, execute and implement whatever they deem advisable.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning whether a person who is trustworthy and knows the Turkish language would be needed if the honored Afnan intends to stay - indeed, after consultation and deliberation, such an arrangement would be necessary. However, in the land of A and S and these regions, while trustworthy individuals can be found, those who know the language cannot be found. In all matters consultation is necessary and then action according to it is beloved. In all conditions, praise be to God, they have been and are victorious and triumphant. As commanded, mention was made of the honored Afnan and that beloved one in letters sent to various regions. I convey greetings and remembrances to the friends of that land, and I beseech from the Tree of Divine Favor inexhaustible fruits for each one.

I beseech Thee by Thy Day through which Thou didst bring forth all other days, and in a single moment whereof Thou didst reckon up the appointed time of all that have been and all that shall be--Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!--\n\nAnd by Thy Name which Thou hast made the sovereign of the kingdom of names and the ruler of all who are in heaven and all who are on earth--Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!--\n\nTo graciously enable Thy servants to dispense with all but Thee, to draw nigh unto Thee, and to become detached from aught else save Thee. Thou, verily, art the God of power, of might and mercy. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!\n\nEnable them then, O my God, to bear witness to Thy unity and to testify to Thy oneness in such wise that they may behold naught save Thee and shut their eyes to all else. Thou, in truth, art powerful to do what pleaseth Thee. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!\n\nKindle, then, within their breasts, O my Beloved, the fire of Thy love, that it may burn away the mention of aught else, and that they may testify within themselves that from everlasting Thou hast dwelt within the inaccessible heights of Thine eternity, that Thou wert alone with none beside Thee, and that Thou wilt continue unto everlasting to be what Thou hast ever been. No God is there but Thee, the Lord of might and bounty. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!\n\nFor were Thy servants who long to scale the heights of Thy unity to set their hearts upon aught except Thee, they could not be reckoned among such as have truly believed, nor would the sign of Thy singleness be found within them. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Such being the case, I implore Thee to send down from the clouds of Thy mercy that which shall purify the hearts of Thine ardent lovers and sanctify the souls of those who adore Thee. Raise them up, then, through Thy transcendent power, and render them victorious over all who dwell on earth. This, indeed, is that which Thou hast promised Thy loved ones through Thy word of truth: \"And We desire to show favour to those who were brought low in the land, and to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make of them Our heirs.\" Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art \"He\", O Thou besides Whom there is none but \"He\"!\n\n=== END BH00759 ===\n\n=== START BH00760 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to God, the Everlasting, the Eternal, the All-Powerful, Who hath encompassed earth and heaven through His Supreme Word, Who hath created man and distinguished him above all other created things, taught him His path, enabled him to voice His praise, and caused him to know that which draweth him nigh unto His most holy court and sacred threshold. He, verily, is the One Who doeth what He willeth through His word \"Be,\" and it is. Glory and splendor be upon the Hands of His Cause who have arisen to serve Him and have traversed the lands by His leave to exalt His Word. These are honored servants, triumphant servants, servants who have held fast to the cord of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that beloved of the heart was received repeatedly. In truth, in each one the signs of the vernal breeze were evident, and since it was adorned with the mention of the Peerless Friend, it brought freshness to the world of being. After its reading, having sought permission to present it at the Most Exalted Station and the Dawning-Place of the revelation of the Lord of all beings, it was entirely submitted and achieved the honor of being heard. And this is what was sent down from the heaven of grace and bounty in reply, His Word--exalted be His majesty, mighty be His proof, and great be His sovereignty:\n\nO Amin! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds! Thy letters were received repeatedly and repeatedly achieved the honor of being presented and answered in the Most Holy Court. We beseech God, thy Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth, to aid thee to that which will elevate the station of humanity in the world of creation. Verily, He doeth whatsoever He willeth. We ask of the Truth to assist thee. O Amin! Thy name is associated with the name of God, and thy relation is mentioned and attributed to Him. We hope that this station and this rank will remain before thine eyes that thou mayest act according to their requirements. Thou hast ever been occupied with the mention of the friends. In every letter thou hast made mention of the sincere ones and those who are nigh with most excellent remembrances, and hast sought special favors for each one. God willing, hereafter too, even as before, nay rather like unto the sun among the companions, thou shalt be radiant and luminous. Great is the station of the servants with God, how much more that of His loved ones, how much more that of His chosen ones, how much more that of the companions of the Crimson Ark who have detached themselves from all save Him and regard and have regarded all else as non-existent. Names did not veil them, nor did might and glory prevent them. Their purpose hath been and is none other than the exaltation of the Word and the quenching of the fire that hath been kindled, through wisdom and utterance. In this Revelation the sun of mercy hath risen and is manifest from all directions. There is no place for warfare, and no station for strife. The heat of the sword and wrath have been transformed into the gentle breezes of compassion and kindness. The souls who are associated with the Most Great Name must at all times assist the purpose of the worlds through the hosts of utterance, and must recognize the station of the helpers and not transgress the rights of the servants. In this day, every one of the kings who hath arisen to help and who hath protected the sheep from the wolves--this party of truth must recognize this favor and, throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven, must engage in praise and gratitude to God and in glorification and laudation of the helper.\n\nO my God, my God! Aid the rulers of the earth and its learned ones to look upon what Thou hast manifested with justice and fairness. Then assist them, O my God, in that which will profit them in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones and say: Strive ye, and through kindliness and compassion and unity and oneness, guide the servants to the Dayspring of Revelation and the Source of Inspiration. O people of Baha! By the Luminary of Utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of the Lord of all beings in this darksome night, to whatever degree ye increase in hearts the love which is a divine trust, the lights of guidance will encompass and illumine the world. Attention, vision and deeds must be for the sake of God, not for the desires of self and passion. In creation the effulgences of the Light of Divine Manifestation exist and are witnessed. Cast aside hatred and hold fast to supreme love. We beseech God to draw you nigh unto Him and cause you to speak that which will attract the hearts of His servants, and to aid you in that which will guide creation to His path and acquaint them with the way of righteousness. Verily He is the Lord of the servants and the Ruler on the Day of Return.\n\nThe mention of that beloved one is ever present in heart and tongue. I beseech the True Omnipotent to increase at every moment his resolve and success in service. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nThe letter from that beloved one which arrived from Beirut was read. Regarding the mount mentioned therein, after presentation They said: The honored Amin is aware of the multitudes in this land. The existing mounts should be offered for sale rather than new ones acquired.\n\nThe letter of the spiritual beloved, the honored 'Ayn, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, which was sent to that honored one and forwarded to the Most Holy Court, was presented in its entirety. They said: The aforementioned one, upon him be My Baha and loving-kindness, though he expressed in his letter lack of success, yet Truth beareth witness to his success and confirmation. The King of deeds and Master of acts is the recognition of God, as acknowledged by the Self-Sufficient. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto this and hath quaffed from the choice wine of utterance and the Kawthar of exposition. And that tribulations and hardships sometimes befall him is due to his connection to the Divine Cause. From the earliest days until now, the Ancient Beauty hath suffered at the hands of the peoples that which caused the essence of being to lament and the eye of reality to weep. O Amin! We bear witness to his acceptance and turning unto God in days when acceptance was as rare as the philosopher's stone - mentioned in word but absent in meaning. The honored Varqa, upon him be My Baha and loving-kindness and grace, is present in that land. Let them consult with him and with any of the loved ones they wish, and adhere to what emerges from consultation. By the life of God, 'Abdu'llah is present and witnessed in the court of the Wronged One. We have given him to drink of the Kawthar of My remembrance from the hand of My bounty and have mentioned him in that which will preserve his remembrance in My perspicuous Book.\n\nO Amin! In every city thou enterest, mention the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Reflect upon the Shi'ih sect. Until now they have not found rest or peace, and are so aflame with the fire of hatred and animosity that if every atom of creation were given a tongue, or if a hundred tongues were ordained for each, they could not enumerate it. Every discerning one beareth witness to this. With utmost effort preserve the people lest they again fall prey to the vain imaginings of the deniers of the previous dispensation. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to the friends in every city and every land, and beseecheth God--exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors--for whatsoever leadeth to the exaltation of His Word and the elevation of His Cause. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Counsellor, the All-Remembering, the Trustworthy. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon the people of Baha who have stood firm with supreme steadfastness in this momentous Cause.\n\nThe Servant\n\n26 Ramadan 1307\n\n=== END BH00760 ===\n\n=== START BH00761 ===\n\nHis Holiness the Physician, upon him be the Glory of God\n\n22 Ramadan 1296\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, His greatness and His power!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and revealed the signs and made clear to all what He intended. He is the Lord of creation Who ordaineth that whereby countries are uplifted and commandeth that whereby the hearts of servants are assured. Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled what He promised and spoken and testified to Him Who came and appeared. Verily He is the Hidden Treasure and the Most Glorious Name and the Ultimate Goal. Through Him the ocean of eternity surged and the Most Great Word appeared and the Most Exalted Station was revealed, and through Him the Crimson Scroll was sent down. Verily He is the Beginning and He Who appeared in the Return.\n\nAnd now, how sweet is the fragrance of love and faithfulness wafting from the paradise of your letter, wherein I found each word to be a leaf from the leaves of the Tree that grew through God's remembrance and grace. When the wine of your praise of my Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds took hold of me, I approached the station of the Desired One and presented it before the Throne. Then the tongue of the Beloved spoke: Though sorrows have encompassed Me due to what hath befallen the Cause of God, I rejoice in the mention of him who hath turned to My face, uttered My praise, and risen to serve Me. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist him in all conditions and strengthen him as He strengthened him before. Verily He is the Almighty, the Most High.\n\nO My physician! Thou must, God willing, arise to serve the Cause with utmost endeavor, in such wise that whatsoever is uttered by the tongue, occureth to the heart, is witnessed by the eye, or perceived by the faculty of understanding shall not prevent thee from remembering the Lord of Eternity. Most of the servants are inflamed by a word and extinguished by a breath. If hearts are truly kindled by the fire of the love of God, surely the sprinkling of the seas of opposition will not quench them. By the life of God! If one is given life by the Divine Word and becomes alive, lassitude will not overtake him, nor will the happenings of the world hold him back from service. Beseech ye God to keep steadfast in this Most Great Cause those souls who have accepted it, in such wise that neither the oppressor's might nor the heedless one's tyranny shall frighten or disturb them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the Perspicuous. May the Word take up its abode in every heart. He is verily the All-Wise Administrator. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath held fast to the cord of My grace, hath attained unto My days, and hath spoken My beauteous praise.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about Haji Ghulam-'Ali, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in this regard: Verily We make mention of him in truth that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Ghulam-'Ali! Blessed art thou for having turned toward a land wherein were planted the trees of My love, which when they grew tall, the oppressors cut down with manifest tyranny. O Land of the City! Blessed art thou for within thee lie the trust of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Wise. And blessed is he who draweth nigh unto their graves and attaineth the honor of visiting them; he is assuredly among the people of Paradise in a glorious Book. O Physician! Give him the glad tidings of what the All-Merciful hath revealed for him, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Generous.\n\nAnd regarding his request for permission to turn toward the Most Holy Court and return after a nine-day stay, it was presented, and the sun of permission rose from the dayspring of grace. He should act as the honored Physician hath written, that is, return to his residence with joy and fragrance after nine days. We praise and thank Him for this. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Haji Ibrahim - upon him be Baha'u'llah - it was presented before the Throne. He said: \"O physician! Verily he attained My presence time and again, turned toward My direction, entered My abode, stood before My gate, heard My call and was blessed with My wondrous Tablet.\" O physician, complete favor hath been shown toward him and he hath drunk the choice wine of eternity in the Most Great Scene. His tribulations and what befell him in the path of God are all witnessed in the Most Holy Court and recorded in the divine Tablet. That he was prevented - this was for his own good. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, may he be aided to remember God and serve His Cause. In truth this matter is great today. Blessed is he who holdeth fast to what he hath been commanded by the Mighty, the Powerful. He hath been mentioned in the Most Holy Court and the glance of favor hath been directed toward him. Remember him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him, that he may rejoice with this supreme joy. We send Our greetings from this Spot to him and to him who is named Qasim and his brother. Verily thy Lord is the Rememberer, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah - upon him be Baha'u'llah - who wrote from the land of ?a, He said: \"We beseech God to aid him and enable him in all conditions to arise for the service of His Cause, that his mention may thereby be exalted in His mighty and impregnable Kingdom.\"\n\nSome time ago, a Most Holy and Sublime Tablet specifically for him was sent with Ibn-i-A?daq - upon him be Baha'u'llah - and before that another Tablet was sent with Aqa Siyyid 'Ali-Akbar - upon him be Baha'u'llah. And in these days a new Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of grace which will be sent with the Letter Sin. God willing, may he be blessed at all times with the favors of the Beloved of the worlds.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Ustad 'Ali-Akbar - upon him be Baha'u'llah - and mentioned his circumstances, his statements indicate his sorrow and the distress of his heart. The cause thereof is not known. The Tablet that was previously revealed was adorned with the utmost favor. Glory be to God! Why have they become sorrowful? And concerning what he mentioned about \"I will make copies of the Sublime Tablet and send them to the world\" - what is meant by this statement? I swear by the ocean of utterance that the Desired One of creation never had and hath not any desire for the mention of these sciences. What was revealed was in response to questions from certain ones who had inquired, and all of it was revealed by the Supreme Pen and sent forth so that no one would attribute ignorance to the Source of knowledge. And He would always say that He desired that the loved ones of God not occupy themselves with these matters. But that he said \"they have thrown my thirty years of effort to the wind\" - from these words infinite sadness can be perceived. It seemeth that he hath become distressed by the word of prohibition that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the Command. In this case, let him act according to his own desire. Whosoever wisheth, let him act; whosoever wisheth, let him desist. In truth this servant became greatly saddened by his sorrow and doth not wish for him to be sorrowful for a moment. We beseech God to aid him and ordain for him that which will gladden his heart. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nHis honor Ismu'llah Haji Mulla Mahdi, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], turned towards this direction and ascended to the Supreme Companion. That which was revealed in his honor would attract the hearts of the world and cause the spirits of lovers to soar. And wonderfully enough, his grave is situated in such a place that in coming and going to the palace, they are blessed with the fragrances of the Beloved. This is naught but a great bounty. His survivors expressed much love for your honor which you had shown them in Mosul. This matter was presented at the Most Holy Court, and He said that such deeds are the cause of creating love and affection. We beseech God to assist all to achieve love and affection. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Responsive.\n\n=== END BH00761 ===\n\n=== START BH00762 ===\n\nPraise be unto God Who is One in His eternity, singular in His grandeur and greatness, sanctified above whatsoever is mentioned in the kingdom of names, and exalted beyond that which the people of creation utter. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Wise. And praise be unto God Who hath chosen servants for His Cause and made them possessors of utterance and wisdom, that they may guide the people unto His Most Great Path and acquaint them with that which hath been revealed in His firm Book, that all may follow that which they have been commanded and forsake that which they have been forbidden. We testify that they are the dawning-places of wisdom and utterance unto all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and the daysprings of knowledge unto the followers of all religions. Upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful at all times, and the glory of the heavens and the earth.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your love! The servant hath been honored by your first letter, from which was diffused the fragrance of the love of the Lord of nations and the King of causes, and your latter letter, through which the heart was gladdened and the eyes were consoled. I read it and was seized with such joy as cannot be reckoned by mortal man. I presented it at the Most Great Vista and laid before God, the Lord of destiny, that which was contained therein. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which tongue and pen are powerless to describe. Exalted, exalted is His loving-kindness! Exalted, exalted is His bounty! Exalted, exalted is His mercy! Exalted, exalted is His favor which hath been directed towards you from this Most Pure Spot!\n\nGod willing, through the favors of the Lord of the worlds, may you be occupied at all times, through both outward and inward confirmations, with the mention of God's Cause and the exaltation of His blessed and goodly Word, and may you repair the damage that hath been wrought by certain souls. By thy life! The heart is well-nigh melted and the very foundations are ready to crumble by reason of that which hath befallen the Dawning-Place of the Cause and the Beloved of the world at the hands of those who claim belief in God yet perpetrate that which causeth the Concourse on High to lament. We beseech God to preserve their tongues from speaking through idle fancy, to draw them nigh unto the Most Sublime Horizon, and to aid them in that which shall profit them in this world and the world to come.\n\nObserve how in all the Tablets all have been forbidden from corruption, bloodshed, and that which causeth tumult amongst men, and have been commanded to act with loving-kindness, love, wisdom and utterance. Nevertheless, they have transgressed the straight path of wisdom and have engaged in that which was forbidden them while neglecting that which was enjoined upon them, imagining that they were arising to aid the Cause. Even as in the land of Ta, they intended a heinous act, as you are aware. Glory be to God! Despite having witnessed how such abhorrent acts, forbidden in the divine Books, have ever been the cause of people's aversion, the loss of the Cause, and the perturbation of souls, this is a day wherein all must hold fast unto the divine commandments and act in accordance with that which He hath ordained.\n\nHis Holiness had mentioned in a previous letter regarding Jenab-i-Aqa Jamal, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, that he had arisen to serve the Cause of God with perfect steadfastness and firmness. Although in truth this matter did not cause harm to the Cause, but rather in one respect caused its exaltation, and his purpose was to assist the Cause, yet since all are commanded in the Divine Tablets to observe wisdom, this matter occurred outside the bounds of wisdom and caused delay in the manifestations of the Cause. Therefore the Supreme Pen has withheld acceptance of it. Today all must fix their gaze upon the Cause of God and act according to what He has commanded. If all good deeds were to proceed from someone yet not be adorned with the ornament of divine acceptance, it would be absolute nothingness and sheer non-existence, and no fruit would appear from those good deeds - how much more so with matters that cause harm to the Cause and the aversion of people and lead to sedition and corruption. We seek refuge in God, again we seek refuge in God! Most strange it is that souls who for numbered years have circled round the Throne and have heard with their own ears the divine utterances - from each letter of which surge forth oceans of loving-kindness and oceans of mercy and seas of favors - have nevertheless issued rulings harmful to people according to their own desires. His Holiness must certainly strive with the utmost endeavor and effort to acquaint people with the divine commands and heavenly ordinances, so that all may arise to support the Cause of the Lord of creation with the virtues of love, kindness, fellowship and affection, and may fix their gaze upon what hath been revealed in the Tablets of God and accept from no one that which is contrary to wisdom. And further, regarding the request to have certain divine books copied, especially for Jenab-i-'A.B., upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory - God willing these will reach him. And concerning what you had written about always having been focused on \"Glory belongeth unto God and unto His Messenger and unto the believers\" and \"glory be to him who is content,\" this was most acceptable in the presence of the Throne, and He said: \"He hath spoken that which beseemeth him; verily he is among the triumphant.\" A Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will especially for His Holiness and hath been sent. And mention of that honored one hath always been and continues to be made in the presence of the Throne and before the Branches of God - may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for them. Although outwardly they have departed, yet inwardly they are present and attending. It is hoped that at all times the breezes of your mention may waft, and that you will write of your own news regarding what hath occurred.\n\nAs to the rose water that was mentioned as being unsuitable, therefore its sending was prevented - when this was presented before the Throne, they said: \"Well was it done.\" And if they wish to know the details of this land, praise be to God all are safe and circumambulating. However, due to the multitude of gatherings, it has nearly reached the point where the cawing of the cawers will be raised. Now forty-five souls besides the immigrants have gathered in this land - a few with permission and the rest have come without permission, despite explicit prohibitions having been revealed in most tablets that no one should come without permission. They have set aside the divine ordinances and act according to their own desires. Even in one of the tablets revealed to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Glory of God, this blessed word shone forth from the horizon of the All-Merciful Will: \"Whosoever turns toward My direction without My permission is not of Me.\" Despite this firm decree, some have shown audacity and acted according to their own inclinations. It is very clear and evident that whenever harm has befallen the Tree of the Cause, the gathering of the loved ones has been the reason and cause. Just as your honor has heard the details of the Land of Mystery (Adrianople) and Iraq, you should with utmost effort, in whatever city you enter, convey these matters so that perhaps the loved ones of God may attain to what God has willed and be content with God's good-pleasure. And regarding the other souls that were mentioned who are residing in the land, expressions of favor and kindness from the Dayspring of the Cause have been manifested toward all. We beseech God to assist them and aid them in maintaining fellowship and unity and in acting according to what has been revealed in the Book. All who circle round the Throne from the people of the divine tabernacle of infallibility convey their most excellent, impregnable and most glorious greetings to your honor, and likewise all the residents, one and all, express their pure devotion and holy greetings, sanctified above mention and description, to your presence. The Most Glorious Glory be upon your honor and upon the people of Baha.\n\nThe Servant 66 \\[of God\\]\n\n14 Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1293\n\n=== END BH00762 ===\n\n=== START BH00763 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in majesty and power!\n\nPraise be unto Him Who hath adorned the world with the ornament of knowledge, and through it made clear the path of deeds, and revealed that whereby man's station is exalted in the contingent world, and taught them the way of guidance in both beginning and end. He is the One Who cannot be described by firstness or lastness, by outwardness or inwardness, for all these were created in His court of might and brought into being by a word from His presence. He is the One Who hath taken unto Himself no likeness, no partner, no peer, no similitude, and no offspring. Verily, He is God; there is no God but Him. He hath ever been, and there was naught else beside Him. He is the Single One, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom was opened the door of all knowledge and wisdom, and through Whom the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted over all lands and the fragrance of the garment was diffused among all religions. Exalted be He Whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of His signs, the Dayspring of His power, the Source of His commandments, and the Manifestation of His laws. Through Him all created things were moved and all existing things were quickened. Through Him the sea revealed its waves, the Books their mysteries, and the earth its treasures. Through Him all things began with the name of God, and every tongue was moved to His wondrous and glorious remembrance. And upon His family and companions, whom God hath made the stars of the heaven of His grace, the waves of the ocean of His knowledge, the rain from the clouds of His mercy, and the effulgences of the lights of the sun of His wisdom, be abundant peace that cannot be bounded by limits, nor indicated by signs, nor ended by words - peace whose description, definition, praise and glorification leave those who would attempt it in utter helplessness.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that beloved one arrived and brought illumination. In truth it was a spiritual sign and a sweet tiding, for it brought glad news of thy well-being, adorned as thou art with the ornament of love for the Sovereign of existence and illumined by the splendors of the Sun of Truth. The food of the friends of God hath ever been news of well-being, for it is the source of joy and the wellspring of delight. After expressing gladness and joy, proceeding to the main point, all that was written was presented before His presence. The Master - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - hath said \\[...\\]\n\nO Husayn! Upon thee rest My salutations through the centuries and ages! Through the grace and favor of the Chosen One, these places and regions were adorned with the traces of the blessed word \"all things are captive in the grasp of His might.\" The darkened, barren lands were illumined by the lights of the Sun of Batha and made fruitful. No volume among the volumes of the world contained aught but mention of the ascendancy and dominion of the people of unity, and the verses of creation were adorned with His name, and the banners of glory and power were raised by His command. In every moment, God's favor would arrive and victory would be granted, until hearts changed and grew dark. Gradually justice became veiled and tyranny appeared and became established in its place. Fairness was concealed behind clouds and oppression became manifest and evident in its stead. These matters became the cause and reason for the supreme abasement, as was and is witnessed: \"The banners of polytheism flutter above the banners of unity.\" In brief, the glory of the favored community was transformed into abasement. We must beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant awareness and bestow knowledge that we may discover the cause and reason for this transformation and arise to make amends for what was lost. Yet due to the evil of error, all are asleep and heedless of the cause and reason. I swear by the Sun of utterance of the All-Merciful that if time continues in this manner, soon the lamp of guidance will be extinguished and the torch of error will be raised and visible in every place. Say: O my God, my Adored One, my Object of worship! Thy Cause is a light that the hands of the world's oppression are powerless to extinguish, and Thy love is a fire that the oceans of the world cannot cool or quench. By Thy will the ocean of knowledge surgeth and the ships of Thy wisdom sail upon it. Thou art the King of bounty and the Lord of the Day of Recompense. Deprive not Thy servants of the waves of the ocean of Thy gifts, and grant them victory through the hosts of Thy power and might. O Forgiver! Thou art He Whose generosity the sins of His servants could not obstruct or withhold, and Thou art He Who hath ever concealed and desired not the shame of Thy servants. Today the world is seen to be heedless. Grant awareness to all existence of the wonders of Thy generosity and guide them, that all who are on earth may turn to Thy straight path and receive their portion from the ocean of Thy knowledge. The tears of those near unto Thee flow in separation from Thee, and the sighs of the sincere ones rise in their remoteness from Thee. Bounty is Thine alone and generosity befitteth Thee. Remove the veil that eyes may be illumined and brightened by the lights of Thy most exalted horizon. Open the gate of grace with the hands of power, that all may enter Thy holy court and receive their share from the knowledge of Thy most holy and most exalted Being. Vision is from Thee and the power of hearing lieth within the grasp of Thy will. Be generous, that eyes may not be deprived of beholding the signs of Thy craftsmanship and ears may not be bereft of hearkening to Thy sweetest call. Through Thy name the ocean of generosity surgeth and the sun of bounty shineth and existeth. Thy servants are poor and needy, while Thou art the Lord of bounty and generosity and bestowal. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.\n\nUnto Him be praise, thanksgiving and glory! The ocean of bounty hath surged, and the station of remembrance and utterance hath reached its zenith. The fragrances of loving-kindness waft from every word, and the sea of mercy billoweth in every letter. Were the people of the world to turn, even to the extent of a needle's eye, all would attain unto everlasting glory and drink from the eternal chalice. Blessed are they that attain, and blessed are the sincere ones.\n\nThis evanescent servant, throughout all days and nights, beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, confirmation and success, especially for that beloved one who hath ever been and remaineth before mine eyes. A hundred thousand praises be unto the Beloved Lord, Who hath from all directions confirmed and guided that beloved one, and enabled him to remember, praise, and serve His Cause. He is the Omnipotent One, Whose will no impediment can obstruct and Whose influence nothing can cut short. Through His name, the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" hath been raised aloft, and through His sovereignty, the standard of \"He ordaineth what He pleaseth\" hath been made manifest. This banner shall not be seized, nor shall it be moved by any wind, yet not every eye is worthy to behold it or capable of perceiving it.\n\nAgain, a hundred thousand praises be unto the Goal of the world's desires, Who guided that beloved one, bestowed awareness upon him, and confirmed him in all conditions. Unto Him be praise in all circumstances; verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nI convey greetings to all the kindred, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for confirmation, success and protection. Likewise do I implore for the friends that which endureth and lasteth forever, and which remaineth preserved from the vicissitudes of the world. Peace and praise be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.\n\nThat beloved one's missive arrived and was accepted. We beseech the Most High to assist you with the means of the seen and the unseen, to make you a champion of His Cause and steadfast in His service. We beseech Him to make your deeds and your remembrance as enduring as the kingdom of earth and heaven. I give you glad tidings at the end of this letter of that which hath shone forth from the horizon of grace as the luminary of permission. Whenever wisdom requireth, turn ye towards it. This servant asketh his Lord for that success which hath no likeness in all the world.

We have heard and answered thee, even as We answered thee before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful. Grieve not over separation, for He remembereth thee through His Name, the Near One. Hold fast to the cord of teaching with wisdom and utterance, that haply the people of creation might turn unto the countenance of their Lord, the All-Knowing.

Abandon all else but Me and soar in My atmosphere, then drink what hath been ordained in the kingdom of My favors and the dominion of My providence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compassionate. We have made mention of thee in numerous tablets. Arise to remember thy Lord in such wise that hearts may be attracted thereby. By the life of God! Shouldst thou inhale the fragrances of thy Lord's verses, thou wouldst forsake all who are on earth and arise to make mention of this Prisoner.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath spoken in remembrance of thee and become renowned for thy praise, that he may rejoice in thy bounty which hath encompassed the horizons. O Ashraf! The servant present hath recited what thou didst compose in remembrance of God, the Lord of all mankind. Well is it with thee, then blessed art thou for having occupied thyself with that which hath brought joy to the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. We make mention of thee even as We mentioned thee before, whereunto testifieth that which hath flowed from My \\[swift-moving\\] Pen. Beseech God to make thee steadfast in this Most Great Cause and eloquent in that which shall endure throughout the ages. Make mention of thy Lord amongst the people, that perchance they may abandon what they possess and take hold of that which hath come unto them from God, the Lord of all beings. Glory be upon thee and upon that which hath proceeded from thee in praise of thy Lord, the All-Bestowing.\n\nO Name of Bounty! Hearken to the call of the Desired One Who maketh mention of thee from this praiseworthy station. The servant who is present hath laid before Us that which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty who hath migrated with God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We make mention of thee and thy son and those who are with thee, that ye may give thanks unto God, the Lord of the seen and unseen.\n\nO Javad! Make thyself ready to hearken unto the verses of thy Lord, then hear what the Lord of creation calleth unto thee from this forbidden station. Verily, the Hidden Mystery speaketh with My tongue and hath not been made manifest except through My Revelation, which is established upon the throne in this Most Great Prison and proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but I, the True One, the Knower of things unseen.\"\n\nSay: O loved ones of the All-Merciful in the realm of possibility! Turn with illumined hearts toward the White Spot, this station wherefrom the Dayspring of Glory proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Witnessed.\" Hold fast unto the cord of My remembrance and abandon all else - those who have cast the path of God behind their backs and followed every vain imagination. Rejoice in what hath been mentioned by the tongue of thy Lord, then make mention of My loved ones through these words whereby the graves have been quickened. Say: Despair not of the mercy of your Lord. Rejoice in the choice wine of My beloved remembrance.\n\nSay: O My loved ones! Hold fast unto the cord of unity. By the life of God! Through it shall the Cause of God be exalted and His sovereignty be made manifest among all who witness and are witnessed. Say: Divide not the Word of God. Gather ye together around that which I have commanded you in My perspicuous Tablet. Act according to that which the All-Merciful hath sent down in His Most Holy, Sacred and Blessed Book.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Diya in the Kingdom of Names. Say: Rejoice in this most great favor and cling to this exalted station. By the life of God! This is the Day of remembrance and praise. Leave all else and speak forth this wondrous remembrance. Say: O people of the graves! By God! The trumpet hath been sounded and the mountains have passed away and the heaven hath come with a manifest command. Arise and turn with shining faces toward the Supreme Horizon. Beware lest the world hold you back from this mighty favor. No day like this day shall come unto you, nor any remembrance like this wise remembrance. God shall soon make manifest that which hath appeared from His loved ones and shall exalt them in truth as a grace from His presence. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nSay: Ye were created for My remembrance and praise. To this doth the Tongue of My grandeur bear witness in the pavilion of My glory and the tabernacle of My mighty Command. Act in such wise as would gladden the Concourse on High, not in that which would delight the people of the world. By My life! It shall perish, while there shall endure for you in My Kingdom that which the pens are powerless to describe. Say: Thus doth the Wronged One make mention of you, though sorrows encompass Him. He, verily, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.\n\nO friends! Beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, that He may enable all to succeed in matters that will perpetuate their remembrance. All must be like unto the morning star, radiant and resplendent from the horizons of the heaven of divine love. That which is possible to be manifested in these days cannot be manifested at any other time. Therefore, all must arise to compensate for what hath escaped them, for that which is lost today can never be retrieved. He verily speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way. Convey wondrous and sublime greetings to all the loved ones of God. Though not all names were mentioned, all are remembered before His Countenance, and those souls who have newly turned to the stream of divine knowledge are blessed with God's favors. Blessed are they for having cast away all else and taken hold of this Name, whereby all souls were shaken except such as God hath willed. All friends must engage in teaching God's Cause with perfect unity and harmony, and must in all conditions observe wisdom, lest that occur which may disturb the hearts.\n\nWe make mention of him whom God hath adorned with My servitude, he who is named 'Abdu'l-Husayn. O servant! The servant who is present hath come and presented before the Countenance thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty, and the Lord of creation maketh mention of thee in this perspicuous scroll. Rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen, and in that the face of thy Lord hath turned toward thee from this distant station. Be thou of such character that the sincere ones may inhale from thee the fragrance of steadfastness in this mighty Cause. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of God and for having known the Beloved when every heedless doubter turned away. Thus have We mentioned thee that thou mayest rejoice and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Stranger.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of the handmaidens who have remembered their Lord and turned toward God, the Lord of all worlds. O My handmaidens! Blessed are ye and blessed is every maidservant who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of every leaf who hath held fast to the Tree of the Cause and hath called upon her Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. We have heard your call and have turned toward you from the direction of My mighty Throne. God counseleth His handmaidens with that which beseemeth His days and His Name, whereby the mightiest idol hath lamented and the back of every distant polytheist hath been broken.\n\nWe make mention of her who hath turned toward God and hath attained the honor of visiting the House in this Most Great Prison. Verily her Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Munificent Giver. O My handmaiden! Thy letter was presented and what was contained therein was read before the Throne, and We have answered thee as a grace from Our presence, and We are the Answerer. Hold thou fast unto the cord of sanctity, then make mention of that which thou wast bidden before the Countenance. He, verily, is the Counselor, the All-Knowing. Glory be upon the people of Baha and upon those handmaidens who have believed in God, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH00764 ===\n\n=== START BH00765 ===\n\nUnto him who is the essence of the people of faithfulness and purity, His Honor, our Master Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God!\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!\n\nExalted is He Who is the Sovereign of all kingdoms and the King of those who dwell in the realms of inaccessibility, Who hath caused the sun of the Most Great Word to shine forth from the horizon of the Most Ancient Pen, whereby the abstract realities, the sanctified essences, the pure and holy souls, and the assured and steadfast hearts have all been set ablaze. All these have testified to that which the Dove of Heaven hath testified in the midmost heart of eternity: that verily the Kingdom on this day belongeth unto God, the One, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious.\n\nHow excellent are those radiant lights and lofty exemplars who have arisen with the spirit of might amidst the servants and called out to all creation: \"By God! The Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling hath come! His is the glory and greatness, His the majesty and power! He hath taken a gem from among the gems of creation, purified it with the hand of His power and the fingers of His might, and caused the sun of His beauty and the light of His grandeur to shine upon it. Thereupon it prostrated before His Being and arose to aid His Cause in the world of creation, drank from the pure water of His love, detached itself from the mention of aught else but Him.\" This is he who hath been named in the heaven of faithfulness as Muhammad Mustafa - upon him be the sun of remembrance from the supreme horizon and the light of glorification from the dawning-place of grandeur.\n\nO my God! I know not by what remembrance to remember Thy near servants who have fulfilled Thy Covenant in these days wherein all have broken Thy pledge. They have arisen to aid Thy Cause and have detached themselves from all directions and from their own selves out of love for Thy most exalted Self and Thy Beauty that shineth forth from the horizon of Thy most sublime Being. They have been touched in Thy path by tribulations which the Pen of Creation is powerless to recount. I testify, O my God, that through their turning unto the court of Thy oneness, I have drunk the cup of acceptance from the hand of the Cup-Bearer of Thy mercy, and through their orientation toward the Dayspring of the lights of Thy Revelation, I have attained the light of recognition and turned toward the sanctuary of certitude. By Thy glory, O my God! Were it not for the lights of their permanence, I would surely have remained in the darkness of annihilation, as one brought to naught. How then can this feeble tongue make mention of those whom Thou hast made the manifestations of the lights of Thy majesty and glory? Among them, O my God, is this blessed Name whom Thou hast made the choicest of the chosen ones and the essence of the righteous and the learned.\n\nO my God! The remembrances of this evanescent one befit not his presence nor are worthy of his station. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Remembrance and by Thy Most Perfect and Ancient Name that Thou make mention of him upon the throne of Thy beauty and the seat of Thy majesty with such holy remembrances as lie hidden within the pavilion of Thy mystery and are treasured beneath the veils of Thy Cause, that his eyes and the eyes of them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creatures may be solaced thereby. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, possessed of grace and bounty, and the All-Merciful, possessed of generosity and bestowal. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for thee and for thy steadfastness in the Cause of thy Lord, the Lord of all names! Though thou art by outward nationality Iraqi, yet as thou hast for some time associated and communed with Persian friends and learned their expressions, therefore these few words are addressed in Persian to that Iraqi friend. By whatever means, one must find a way to the heart of a friend. O beloved of my heart and soul! The essence of knowledge and deeds, and the most ancient and excellent thereof, is today to arise to aid the Cause of the Lord of creation and the King of nations. Although thou hast exerted great and lofty efforts in all aspects to aid God's Cause and promote His Faith, what hath been manifested from thee in service and support of the Cause hath been thy portion, and what is now being conveyed is this servant's portion which thou must fulfill, as the outward means are cut off from this servant. Be not content that one or two souls attain the water of recognition. Let the scattered tributaries that have branched from the Most Great Ocean be joined to the mightiest stream and enter the shore of the Sea of Seas. This was conveyed before and is now conveyed again, that thou mayest strive in this Cause and take the reins through the power of thy All-Knowing Lord. He will verily assist thee through His command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. However, these matters must be approached with complete wisdom, for the foundation of this momentous Cause is based on wisdom, and among wisdom's requirements are planning and reflection. These two are like the two wings for the bird of the heaven of wisdom. Today these aspects are confined to thy being. Consider thyself alone in teaching and supporting the Cause. It is hoped from the ocean of the Most Merciful's bounty that thou wilt arise from the horizon of teaching and utterance in such wise as to illumine and brighten all those lands with the lights of guidance and the manifestations of the Sun of Grandeur. This is not difficult for God. The confirmations of the Most Great Spirit have been with thee. God willing, thou wilt act according to what hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in all circumstances. Again it is submitted that today teaching God's Cause is the greatest of all things and most excellent of all that is mentioned. All of us who have been blessed from the Most Wondrous, Most Glorious cup must, with pure servitude and complete humility, detached from ourselves and all else, invite people to the Divine Law. Furthermore, regarding those souls who have been disturbed in this greatest upheaval, they must be treated with conciliation that perchance they may return to the ocean of certitude. It is known that most souls are weak, but God's pre-existing mercy looks to ensure that no soul remains deprived, especially those who have endured hardships. In any case, it is incumbent upon thee to deal with such souls with kindness that they may not be deprived of divine bounty. Furthermore, the evil one 'Ali-Muhammad hath written and continues to write whatever his soul dictates, resembling Tablets, on various papers and hath distributed them in the name of Truth. He hath ever been and still is engaged in this work. There he hath committed the same act and given them to certain souls to show people. The harm of this matter is great. Thou must not be heedless of this. We beseech God to remove him from the earth in such wise that no trace of him be seen and none know what became of him. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nThe circling prisoners of the Most Great Prison, one and all, convey their holy salutations, beyond words and utterance, to your honor and the other loved ones of God. Convey infinite expressions of longing, love and greeting from this evanescent servant to all the loved ones of God in that land and the remaining captives in His path who remain in that city. A petition has been sent to Amin Effendi, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. Convey this to him with countless greetings. And the spirit that wafts from the paradise of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, be upon you, O you who have been faithful to your Lord's covenant, steadfast in His Cause, and were among the helpers.\n\nThe Servant of God\n\nThe ring-watch that you had sent to the Most Holy Court was forwarded so that you might sell it and distribute its proceeds among certain handmaidens of God there. One third should be given to ?ayfu'llah, that is, the Guest of Baha'u'llah, and the remaining two thirds should be divided between their two sisters and the sisters of Aqa Muhammad-Rida. Furthermore, they said it is necessary to take care of certain handmaidens of God who have been left without support and whose apparent means have been cut off. Verily, He will fully reward the doers of good. And furthermore, whoever intends may send one veil.\n\n=== END BH00765 ===\n\n=== START BH00766 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, His grandeur and His power!\n\nThe essence of praise and glorification befitteth Him Who is the eternal Purpose, Who hath given ascendancy to a small band over numerous hosts. Though appearing last, it was mentioned and reckoned first in God's Book. Exalted, exalted be He Who made the Seal the Lord of the beginning, and the Last the Sovereign of the first, at Whose advent the heaven and all that is therein and all that is above it were filled with joy. He it is through Whose Name the gates were opened, the Path appeared, the Balance was set forth, and the horizon of justice and peace shone forth - manifest and resplendent from the horizon of God's loving-kindness. Upon Him and upon His family and companions who aided the Cause of God and His Command be peace. These are servants who strived in the path of God in such wise that neither the scorn of the idolaters nor the censure of the critics frightened them. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!\n\nAnd now, the letter of that beloved one, which was adorned with the ornament of love and sincerity, affection and faithfulness, brought joy and delight. God willing, may you ever be blessed by the bounty of the eternal Purpose and dwell peacefully under the shade of the tree of security and protection. After perusing and reviewing its contents, we turned toward His Holiness the Master - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - and all of it was presented. He said: \"O Ali! The fragrance of love wafteth from thy letter. Blessed art thou, O Ali, for thou hast entrusted all matters to God and made them contingent upon His good-pleasure. Thy letter beareth witness to this station and its contents testify to these words. Thou hast not been forgotten and, God willing, never shalt be. From beginning to end, naught was observed in the letter save expressions of submission and contentment, supplication and entreaty, love and attachment. God willing, mayest thou remain steadfast in this lofty station. We beseech God to assist thee to serve His Cause and to ordain for thee that which shall profit thee in this world and the next.\" Peace be upon thee and upon those who have recognized that which the Supreme Pen hath uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nBy the truth of Truth, this servant was so delighted by your letter that words fail to express it, for you referred all matters to God and made them contingent upon His good-pleasure. Similarly, your mention of the Two Most Exalted Names (upon them be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]) and your expression of gratitude and satisfaction with those two beloved ones - truly the matter is exactly as you wrote. This servant testifies to the truth of these words. They were souls who were originally appointed to that land. Through what God manifested, they became the means whereby that land became a gathering place for the friends. However, afterwards some failed to observe this station and due to certain idle fancies a slight taint appeared, though in reality it was both existent and non-existent. If hearts had remained adorned with their original luminosity, this ephemeral one believes no harm would ever have occurred and no division or dispersion would have ensued. Given their precedence, in every matter their counsel should be followed. How many cities to which some turned but found fruitless! Yet that land, due to purity and sincerity of intention, became such that some from outlying regions turned toward it and attained therein what they had not attained elsewhere. It is most evident that all this was through God's favor. How many foreigners dwelt in that land for years but did not become centers of the Cause. All this is from God's grace, His command and His favor. God willing, if gatherings occur henceforth, may they act as they ought, be content and satisfied with what has been ordained for them, and in every matter - whether commerce, partnership or other affairs - consult with them and act upon whatever emerges from consultation. This evanescent servant has submitted these words purely for the sake of God. I beseech God to assist all to that which contains the good of each one. Verily He is the Protector of the sincere ones, the Lord of the content, and the Educator of the worlds.\n\nAs for your stay in Izmir or Alexandria, they said to consult with the Two Names and act according to what is deemed advisable. Wherever you may be, God willing, profit and good will be with you. Some of the melons you took the trouble to send from Izmir arrived and were very good. I hope God, exalted be His glory, will grant you the reward for this. Verily He does not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good.\n\nConcerning your mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, when this was submitted He said: \"God willing, may he not be deprived of the Euphrates of the mercy of the All-Merciful, and may he not be saddened by the obvious upheavals in the world. The world, to one who truly knows, is like a mirage. Surely the wise one will not attach his heart to it. Soon, all that is observed upon the earth will dwell in its depths. This station, lacking stability and permanence, was not and is not worthy of attention. We beseech God to assist him in that which is good for him in all worlds. We have previously mentioned him with words whose fragrance will not fade. Convey My greetings to him on behalf of the Wronged One and gladden him with His mention.\" This evanescent servant conveys greetings to him and states that today is the day of deeds, and pure deeds in all worlds are like a lamp that moves before one's face. God willing, may they remain with perfect steadfastness, firmness and constancy, speaking in remembrance of God. Tyranny has encompassed the world, the enemies of the Faith lie in wait from every direction. May God, exalted be His glory, protect and strengthen this people. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nConvey greetings on my behalf to the two Most Exalted Names \\[the two brothers\\], upon them be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. God willing, may they be occupied with perfect joy, delight and wisdom.\n\nRegarding the new blessing, namely the daughter you mentioned, she has been named Jamilih. God willing, may her steps be blessed and auspicious. The Command is in the hands of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Peace and praise be upon you and upon those who have not broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and who have acted according to what they were commanded in His perspicuous Book.\n\nAs for the account of the departed and elevated mother, upon her be the Glory of God, at the very moment when news arrived of the ascension of that distinguished emigrant lady, this servant was engaged in writing in His presence. At that very moment, mention of her appeared from the horizon of the Pen. God knows that she attained. She was among the handmaidens who attained to His good-pleasure. In the nights and days she had no occupation except the mention of God. Blessed and welcome tidings to her. And Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-Muhammad is engaged in service. In these days, as commanded, he is being sent to the Prussian master so that he may perfect his craft. In any case, you are bound to a great station. Blessed are you. Regarding your request for permission, He said: \"God willing, We shall summon you according to the requirements of the time. The Command is in the hands of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.\"\n\n=== END BH00766 ===\n\n=== START BH00767 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise befitteth the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen, Who, through a single effulgence from the Day-Star of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, hath made manifest the mysteries of the blessed words \"And when the trumpet is blown a second time, at once they will be standing and looking on.\" Great indeed is this Day, and greater still are its requirements.\n\nO Nasr, upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of destiny! Today the secrets of hearts and the treachery of eyes are visible before all faces. Beseech the True One that He deprive not His servants of the outpourings of the Lord of creation on the Day of Return. Man's life in this world is like a breeze that enters through one door and exits through another. Today the friends of the Desired One of all worlds, who have drunk from the ocean of knowledge and are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful, must, with utmost love, spirit, fragrance, wisdom and utterance, awaken the heedless and rouse the slumbering ones.\n\nSay: O friends! Today is the dawn of the Day of Justice. Strive that ye may become manifestations, daysprings and dawning-places of goodly deeds and spiritual, praiseworthy characteristics. In these days man is able to acquire that which ensures eternal permanence and everlasting life.\n\nHis honor Asad, upon him be My glory, presented himself with thy letter. Praise be to God, the fragrance of service and steadfastness emanated therefrom. Today one must hold fast unto any matter from which wafteth the fragrance of justice, equity and goodness, purely for the sake of God, Lord of existence and Commander on the Promised Day. This binding command hath ever been revealed from the Wise, the All-Knowing Commander, as witnessed by the divine Books. He hath commanded all to righteousness and piety, and forbidden transgression and wickedness. Blessed is the city that the vicissitudes of time have not prevented from the light of religion, trustworthiness and chastity. These blessed words have shone forth like the Most Great Luminary from the horizon of divine Tablets. Blessed is he who hath recognized and acted accordingly, and woe unto the heedless ones.\n\nO Nasr! Thou knowest that outwardly the utmost kindness was shown to one who was present at the Sacred Threshold, yet that faithless one, consumed by the fire of greed and passion, melted down the trust and dealt a mighty blow to justice and fairness. He committed that which had no equal. His treachery was ever manifest and evident, yet the Name \"the Concealer\" veiled it until at last, through the temptation of God's enemy, he rent asunder the veil. Now in the City of Divine Justice lamentations are raised, for the harm of his deeds hath affected the Very Tree. The Afnan assisted him, and the friends' commercial dealings were referred to him from every direction. Nevertheless, he preferred greed to contentment, and likewise oppression to justice. I swear by the Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the heaven of will - not a single dinar from those two treasuries rightfully belonged to him. We confirmed this matter for his benefit - namely his trading at the Sacred Threshold - and likewise for the manifestation of the light of trustworthiness among the people. Yet that unjust one occupied himself with falsehood and betrayal day and night, until finally with the hands of greed and avarice he kindled a fire that consumed the vitals of trustworthiness, religion, truthfulness and sincerity. Glory be to God! In the station of faithfulness appeared faithlessness, and in the station of trustworthiness appeared treachery. We beseech God to aid him to return and repent\\[...\\]\n\nHe, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoning, the Generous! Treachery, greed and oppression have reached such a state that their eradication is impossible save through the Will of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, the Master of the Last and the First.\n\nThat which thou didst mention regarding the council and its members hath been accepted. The loved ones of God must at all times occupy themselves with that which conduceth to the refinement of souls, the elevation of beings, and the exaltation of the Word of God. Its manifestation dependeth upon the consultation of the trustees of the House of Justice. Blessed are they who have arisen to serve the world. The effects of such souls shall lead the world from hardship to comfort, from poverty to wealth, and from abasement to glory. We beseech God to assist them in righteousness and piety, and to open before their faces the doors of grace, mercy, blessing and abundance. Verily, He doeth what He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all things. He doeth and judgeth, and He is the Ancient Commander, the All-Knowing Ruler.\n\nPraise be to God that his honor Muhammad-Quli hath been enabled to serve mankind. God willing, the very intention shall prove penetrating and effective, and universal fruits shall appear therefrom. All must at all times fix their gaze upon this exalted word: \"O people of Baha! Aid ye the Lord through deeds and character!\" The influence of deeds is more potent than the influence of words. Goodly deeds and spiritual qualities are each a herald of truth amongst the servants. The triumph of God's Cause dependeth upon these hosts. Perchance souls may arise for the sake of God and deliver the servants from the oppression of the ravenous ones of the earth, that corruption may be transformed into reformation, war into peace, and discord into concord. Say: \"My God, my God! Adorn Thy servants with the ornament of Thy attributes and qualities, that there may appear that which Thou hast purposed for them through Thy bounty and generosity.\"\n\nO Nasr! By the life of God, this Wronged One, though in the dragon's mouth, calleth all unto the horizon of the All-Merciful. Say: \"Hold fast, O people, to the hem of piety, for verily it delivereth the servants and draweth them nigh unto God, the Lord of creation.\" The loved ones of God in those regions must assist the aforementioned soul to the extent possible. Every deed that appeareth today is recorded as the most excellent of deeds by the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are they that act!\n\nThou didst mention his honor Mirza Muhammad, upon him be My Glory. Praise be to God, he is confirmed in remembrance and glorification and in that which causeth the love of God to be diffused throughout all regions. We beseech the Most High to assist him and confirm him in the Greater Steadfastness. The corrupt ones of the Threshold are occupied with spreading false and slanderous reports. Glory be to God! Every person of insight is astonished that one whose treachery is evident as the sun still claimeth religiosity and trustworthiness. Now the property of a number of the companions is suffering and afflicted in the grip of the treacherous one's betrayal. O Nasru'llah! In the land of exile, in prison, there hath befallen this Wronged One that which the pen and ink are powerless to recount. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, glorified be His majesty. Each is illumined by the lights of the Sun of Grace. We have refrained from mentioning names due to wisdom's requirements; however, the companions of the Crimson Ark are present before the Face and standing at the Door. Blessed are they! Likewise, gladden the handmaidens of that land with special favors. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having manifested unto Thy servants the billowing oceans of Thy utterance and the effulgent rays of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence, by Thy mighty cord and Thy perspicuous utterance, and by Thy Most Exalted Word wherewith Thou didst once again quicken such of Thy servants as have drawn nigh unto Thee, to assist Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones to attain unto such steadfastness as shall not be shaken by the doubts of the nations, nor by the clamor of the croakers, nor by the onslaught of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. O Lord! Aid them through the wisdom Thou hast sent down in Thy Books, Thy Scrolls, and Thy Tablets. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy mercy the rains of bounty and bestowal, and ordain for them that which shall draw them nigh unto the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy fellowship. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Almighty. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH00767 ===\n\n=== START BH00769 ===\n\nHe is the Ever-Living, the Ever-Abiding, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nGod testifieth to the unity of His Godhood and to the singleness of His own Being. On the throne of eternity, from the inaccessible heights of His station, His tongue proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him. He Himself, independently of all else, hath ever been a witness unto His own oneness, the revealer of His own nature, the glorifier of His own essence. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Beauteous.\n\nHe is supreme over His servants, and standeth over His creatures. In His hand is the source of authority and truth. He maketh men alive by His signs, and causeth them to die through His wrath. He shall not be asked of His doings, and His might is equal unto all things. He is the Potent, the All-Subduing. He holdeth within His grasp the empire of all things, and on His right hand is fixed the Kingdom of His Revelation. His power, verily, embraceth the whole of creation. Victory and overlordship are His; all might and dominion are His; all glory and greatness are His. He, of a truth, is the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful, the Unconditioned.\n\nPraise be to Thee, to Whom the tongues of all created things have, from eternity, called, and yet failed to attain the heaven of Thine eternal holiness and grandeur. The eyes of all beings have been opened to behold the beauty of Thy radiant countenance, yet none hath succeeded in gazing on the brightness of the light of Thy face. The hands of them that are nigh unto Thee have, ever since the foundation of Thy glorious sovereignty and the establishment of Thy holy dominion, been raised suppliantly towards Thee, yet no one hath been able to touch the hem of the robe that clotheth Thy Divine and sovereign Essence. And yet none can deny that Thou hast ever been, through the wonders of Thy generosity and bounty, supreme over all things, art powerful to do all things, and art nearer unto all things than they are unto themselves.\n\nFar be it, then, from Thy glory that anyone should gaze on Thy wondrous beauty with any eye save Thine own eye, or hear the melodies proclaiming Thine almighty sovereignty with any ear except Thine own ear. Too high art Thou exalted for the eye of any creature to behold Thy beauty, or for the understanding of any heart to scale the heights of Thine immeasurable knowledge. For should the birds of the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee be ever enabled to soar as long as Thine own overpowering sovereignty can endure, or to ascend as long as the empire of Thy Divine holiness can last, they shall, in no wise, be able to transcend the limitations which a contingent world hath imposed upon them, nor pass beyond its confines. How, then, can he whose very creation is restricted by such limitations, attain unto Him Who is the Lord of the Kingdom of all created things, or ascend into the heaven of Him Who ruleth the realms of loftiness and grandeur? Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou, my Best-Beloved! Inasmuch as Thou hast ordained that the utmost limit to which they who lift their hearts to Thee can rise is the confession of their powerlessness to enter the realms of Thy holy and transcendent unity, and that the highest station which they who aspire to know Thee can reach is the acknowledgement of their impotence to attain the retreats of Thy sublime knowledge, I, therefore, beseech Thee, by this very powerlessness which is beloved of Thee, and which Thou hast decreed as the goal of them that have reached and attained Thy court, and by the splendours of Thy countenance that have encompassed all things, and by the energies of Thy Will whereby the entire creation hath been generated, not to deprive them that have set their hopes in Thee of the wonders of Thy mercy, nor to withhold from such as have sought Thee the treasures of Thy grace. Ignite, then, within their hearts the torch of Thy love, that its flame may consume all else except their wondrous remembrance of Thee, and that no trace may be left in those hearts except the gem-like evidences of Thy most holy sovereignty, so that from the land wherein they dwell no voice may be heard except the voice that extolleth Thy mercifulness and might, that on the earth on which they walk no light may shine except the light of Thy beauty, and that within every soul naught may be discovered except the revelation of Thy countenance and the tokens of Thy glory, that haply Thy servants may show forth only that which shall please Thee and shall conform wholly unto Thy most potent will.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O my God! The power of Thy might beareth me witness! I can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of Thy loving-kindness and the breeze of Thy bountiful favour cease, for less than the twinkling of an eye, to breathe over all created things, the entire creation would perish, and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to utter nothingness. Magnified, therefore, be the marvellous evidences of Thy transcendent power! Magnified be the potency of Thine exalted might! Magnified be the majesty of Thine all-encompassing greatness, and the energizing influence of Thy will! Such is Thy greatness that wert Thou to concentrate the eyes of all men in the eye of one of Thy servants, and to compress all their hearts within his heart, and wert Thou to enable him to behold within himself all the things Thou hast created through Thy power and fashioned through Thy might, and were he to ponder, throughout eternity, over the realms of Thy creation and the range of Thy handiwork, he would unfailingly discover that there is no created thing but is overshadowed by Thine all-conquering power, and is vitalized through Thine all-embracing sovereignty.\n\nBehold me, then, O my God, fallen prostrate upon the dust before Thee, confessing my powerlessness and Thine omnipotence, my poverty and Thy wealth, mine evanescence and Thine eternity, mine utter abasement and Thine infinite glory. I recognize that there is none other God but Thee, that Thou hast no peer nor partner, none to equal or rival Thee. In Thine unapproachable loftiness Thou hast, from eternity, been exalted above the praise of any one but Thee, and shalt continue for ever, in Thy transcendent singleness and glory, to be sanctified from the glorification of any one except Thine own Self.\n\nI swear by Thy might, O my Beloved! To make mention of any created thing beseemeth not Thy most exalted Self, and to bestow any praise upon any one of Thy creatures would be wholly unworthy of Thy great glory. Nay, such a mention would be but blasphemy uttered within the court of Thy holiness, and such praise would amount to no less than a transgression in the face of the evidences of Thy Divine sovereignty. For the mere mention of any one of Thy creatures would in itself imply an assertion of their existence before the court of Thy singleness and unity. Such an assertion would be naught but open blasphemy, an act of impiety, the essence of profanity and a wanton crime.\n\nWherefore, I bear witness with my soul, my spirit, my entire being, that should They Who are the Daysprings of Thy most holy unity and the Manifestations of Thy transcendent oneness be able to soar so long as Thine own sovereignty endureth and Thine all-compelling authority can last, they will fail in the end to attain unto even the precincts of the court wherein Thou didst reveal the effulgence of but one of Thy most mighty Names. Glorified, glorified be, therefore, Thy wondrous majesty. Glorified, glorified be Thine unattainable loftiness. Glorified, glorified be the pre-eminence of Thy kingship and the sublimity of Thine authority and power.\n\nThe highest faculties which the learned have possessed, and whatsoever truths they, in their search after the gems of Thy knowledge, have discovered; the brightest realities with which the wise have been endowed, and whatever secrets they, in their attempts to fathom the mysteries of Thy wisdom, have unravelled, have all been created through the generative power of the Spirit that was breathed into the Pen which Thy hands have fashioned. How, then, can the thing which Thy Pen hath created be capable of comprehending those treasures of Thy Faith with which, as decreed by Thee, that Pen hath been invested? How can it ever know of the Fingers that grasp Thy Pen, and of Thy merciful favours with which it hath been endowed? How can it, already unable to reach this station, be made aware of the existence of Thy Hand that controlleth the Fingers of Thy might? How can it attain unto the comprehension of the nature of Thy Will that animateth the movement of Thy Hand?\n\nGlorified, glorified be Thou, O my God! How can I ever hope to ascend into the heaven of Thy most holy will, or gain admittance into the tabernacle of Thy Divine knowledge, knowing as I do that the minds of the wise and learned are impotent to fathom the secrets of Thy handiwork--a handiwork which is itself but a creation of Thy will?\n\nPraise be to Thee, O Lord, my God, my Master, my Possessor, my King. Now that I have confessed unto Thee my powerlessness and the powerlessness of all created things, and have acknowledged my poverty and the poverty of the entire creation, I call unto Thee with my tongue and the tongues of all that are in heaven and on earth, and beseech Thee with my heart and the hearts of all that have entered beneath the shadow of Thy names and Thine attributes, not to shut us from the doors of Thy loving-kindness and grace, nor to suffer the breeze of Thy bountiful care and favour to cease from being wafted over our souls, nor to permit that our hearts be occupied with any one except Thee, or our minds to be busied with any remembrance save remembrance of Thy Self.\n\nBy the glory of Thy might, O my God! Wert Thou to set me king over Thy realms, and to establish me upon the throne of Thy sovereignty, and to deliver, through Thy power, the reins of the entire creation into my hands, and wert Thou to cause me, though it be for less than a moment, to be occupied with these things and be oblivious of the wondrous memories associated with Thy most mighty, most perfect, and most exalted Name, my soul would still remain unsatisfied, and the pangs of my heart unstilled. Nay, I would, in that very state, recognize myself as the poorest of the poor, and the most wretched of wretches.\n\nMagnified be Thy name, O my God! Now that Thou hast caused me to apprehend this truth, I beseech Thee by Thy Name which no scroll can bear, which no heart can imagine and no tongue can utter--a Name which will remain concealed so long as Thine own Essence is hidden, and will be glorified so long as Thine own Being is extolled--to unfurl, ere the present year draw to a close, the ensigns of Thine undisputed ascendancy and triumph, that the whole creation may be enriched by Thy wealth, and may be exalted through the ennobling influence of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and that all may arise and promote Thy Cause.\n\nThou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Highest, the All-Glorious, the All-Subduing, the All-Possessing.\n\n=== END BH00769 ===\n\n=== START BH00770 ===\n\nHe is the Dawning One from the horizon of the heaven of proof!\n\nO loved ones of the Most Merciful in Milan! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He hath turned towards you from the prison precincts and desireth to remind you of the verses of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. They draw you nigh unto Him, open before your faces the gates of attainment, and give you to drink of the Kawthar of immortality from the hand of bounty. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nThere hath befallen Us in prison that which hath caused the hearts of them that are nigh unto God to melt. The people have turned away from the Countenance and followed the desires of them that have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment. O people of God! We counsel you with that wherewith God hath counseled His servants: Associate not with God, the Lord of all the worlds. Cast aside the dawning-places of idle fancies, clinging fast to the cord of certitude. Thus have We counseled Our loved ones aforetime and in this perspicuous Tablet.\n\nBeware lest the happenings of the world and what hath appeared from the nations sadden you. Trust ye in God under all conditions, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. He is with you, heareth your call and seeth your deeds. He is the One Whom the oppression of them that have associated partners with God hath not hindered, nor the clamor of every remote ignorant one.\n\nAdorn your temples with the ornament of godliness and your hearts with the light that hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the heaven of My Most Exalted Pen, which hath sent down every clear Book. Beware lest ye exchange nearness for remoteness and acceptance for rejection. We desire to behold you possessed of such steadfastness as would cause the hearts of the people to tremble and the feet of the polytheists to slip.\n\nBlessed is he who hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath aided God through wisdom and utterance. He is of the sincere ones in My Mighty Book. The Most Great Ocean hath manifested the pearls of proof by the command of the Most Merciful, yet most of the people are heedless. Eyes have not attained their radiance, nor have ears heard My Call which hath been raised in truth, save those who have cast away the dawning-places of hatred and taken what they were bidden by God in this wondrous Day.\n\nO people! The Self-Subsisting hath come, and by His command the Salsabil hath flowed. Blessed is he who hath advanced, hastened, and drunk therefrom. Woe unto them that have turned away, who have violated My Covenant and My Testament, and have cast behind their backs My mighty Announcement which was mentioned in the Qur'an and, before it, in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Beware lest the veils of glory prevent you from drawing nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Let not the clamor of the hypocrites prevent thee from thy most sweet trill, and let not the conditions of tyranny and error veil thee from this glorious, mighty station whereon the Most Great Throne hath been established and whereon the Wronged One hath sat with a power that hath conquered all things and a might that hath subdued all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO friends of the All-Merciful in Milan! Ye are they who have turned unto His Countenance on a day when the people of error turned away from the Self-Subsisting, rejected His signs, and disputed His sovereignty, until they pronounced sentence upon the shedding of His blood. Thus did their souls deceive them. They are, verily, numbered with the idolaters in the sight of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Rejoice, O My friends, in My Name, and drink the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of My bounty, in defiance of those who have broken My Covenant and My Testament, and have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled, and most of the people are among the losers.\n\nWe have commanded you before, and after, and in this Tablet, with that which shall elevate you and profit you in all the worlds of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We beseech God to assist you with the hosts of divine care and favor, and to enable you to that which shall cause His traces to spread throughout the East and West of the earth. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nGrieve not over what hath befallen you in My path. We have borne afflictions and trials for the reformation of the world and the salvation of the nations. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken when the Wronged One was speaking that which draweth the servants nigh unto the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have counseled you in the Tablets and in My Books and Scrolls, wherein every word calleth you to the most exalted station. This is a day whereon the doors of mercy and utterance have been opened unto all who dwell within the realm of possibility. Hasten, O people of the earth, and be not of them that tarry. Ye were not created for yourselves, but for the service of the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the face that hath turned toward the lights of the Countenance, and the poor one who hath attained the ocean of wealth, and the seeker who hath attained unto his Goal on this Day which God hath adorned with His mention in the Books of them that are nigh unto Him.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath attained thy presence, who hath been named 'Ali-'Askar in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We beseech God to make him a servant of His Cause and one who speaketh His praise with the wisdom wherewith We have commanded Our loved ones in My Great Tablet.\n\nO Alif and Ha! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names. Thou and thy children and those with thee have been mentioned from the earliest days. We beseech God to write down for thee the reward of those who have attained His presence time and again. We make mention of thee at this moment and behold thee before the Throne. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this testimony which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in this exalted station.\n\nWe make mention of the handmaidens of God in that place and give them glad tidings of His grace and bounty. We beseech God to confirm them in steadfastness and to give them to drink of His hallowed wine which floweth by His firm and binding command.\n\nO people of Milan! Upon you be the Glory of God and His mercy, then the grace of God and His bounty. Verily, He is with you and heareth that which proceedeth from your mouths, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. When the choice wine of verses hath taken hold of you and the breezes of revelation have attracted you, say:\n\nO our God! Thou seest us turning unto Thee, holding fast unto the cord of Thy grace and favor, standing firm in the service of Thy Cause, and awaiting the wonders of Thy bounty and grace. We beseech Thee, by those who hastened to the place of sacrifice in their longing to meet Thee and behold Thy beauty, and who gave up their spirits for Thy name and love, to ordain for us that which shall draw us nigh unto Thee and enable us to perform the deeds wherewith Thou hast commanded us in Thy Book. O Lord! We are Thy servants and in Thy grasp, and we have turned unto the horizon of Thy grace and the ocean of Thy bounty. We beseech Thee not to deprive us of that which Thou hast ordained in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, Whom the pharaohs of the earth and its wolves cannot frustrate. Thy sovereignty hath prevailed, Thy Cause hath appeared, and Thy verses have been sent down. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nIn the Persian tongue We make mention: O 'Ali-Qabl-i-'Askar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of the Throne. Blessed art thou for having turned thyself unto the Wronged One whilst He was in His Most Great Prison. The Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to thy presence, thy hearkening, and thy turning unto God, glorified be His majesty. Convey unto the loved ones in that land the greetings of the Wronged One. All must partake each day of the choice wine of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds. This choice wine in one station representeth the verses of God, glorified be His majesty, in another station His remembrance and praise, and in yet another His bounty and grace. This choice wine in one station is the cause of the life of the world, and in another the cause of the preservation of the peoples. Whoso drinketh thereof attaineth unto the most great steadfastness in this Cause whereby the hearts of all men have been shaken, save whom God, the Lord of this exalted station, willeth. Praise be to God that all the men and women of that land have attained unto the mention of God, and in this most holy and radiant Day the mention of all hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Say: Rejoice, then render thanks unto your Lord for this great bounty. Know ye the value of these days. The call is raised at all times, the Kingdom of Utterance speaketh forth, the river of mercy floweth from the Most Exalted Pen, and the Salsabil of generosity is manifest. The chalices of prosperity are visible and evident - seize them in His Name and drink thereof in His remembrance. The mercy that shineth forth and appeareth from the waves of the ocean of My bounty be upon My loved ones and My handmaidens who have submitted to the command of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Praise be to God, for He is the Goal of them that know.\n\n=== END BH00770 ===\n\n=== START BH00771 ===\n\nIn the Name of the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful\n\nO Amin! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have seen and heard thy letter which thou didst send from the Land of Ta to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. The Supreme Pen hath ever mentioned all the peoples of the world and counseled them to trustworthiness, righteousness, and that whereby the Word is exalted. Thou and the loved ones of this Revelation have all borne and continue to bear witness that the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath opened a gate of mercy through His Most Noble Name, the like of which hath not been seen from the beginning of the world until now. Blessed are they who have attained and who have hearkened unto and answered their Lord, the Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nThou didst make mention of the loved ones of Van. Praise be to God, they have attained unto the dewdrops of the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of all worlds. We counsel them to trustworthiness and righteousness and to that whereby the laws and ordinances of God are uplifted. Blessed is the soul who in this day layeth down and raiseth up his head upon his couch with the intention of reforming the world. The best of all deeds is to show forth love towards all the peoples of the world. The party that hath truly been and continues to be an obstacle to this most great bounty and this most great favor is the Shi'ih party. Their beliefs and vain imaginings have deluded them. We beseech God that He may aid that party to return from oppression and tyranny to justice and equity. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nThou didst make mention of Khuy and Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Jalil, and likewise of the enthusiasm of the loved ones in those regions. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them to make mention of Him and to praise Him, and to ordain for them that which shall enable them to spread love and affection and to unite their hearts in harmony. We have previously made mention of Jinab-i-Jalil, upon him be My glory. Today the loved ones of the Wronged One must arise to accomplish that which is the cause of success and prosperity. The primary purpose is to extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity that lieth concealed and hidden in the hearts of the people of Iran. However, through the hosts of tender counsels and wise exhortations, this Wronged One beseecheth from God whatsoever conduceth to the development of the world and the refinement of the souls of the nations.\n\nO Amin! Reflect upon the hypocrites and the calumniators. The events that occurred at the Threshold were a sign from God so that certain oppressors might recognize and comprehend that which is hidden. All of this occurred due to the seduction of Shaykh Muhammad-i-Yazdi and his guide who is on the island. Beseech God that He may make the servants aware. In brief, that which became manifest in that city was a proof for the manifestations of justice and equity, that they might know what befell the Wronged One in numbered years. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Patient, and He commandeth thee to exercise gracious patience. No one should oppose the opposers. Leave them to God. Verily, He is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nWe have previously made mention of the brother of Jinab-i-Jalil who ascended. We beseech God to forgive him through His grace and to send down upon him from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. A most holy and most exalted Tablet hath been specifically revealed and sent down from the heaven of favor for Jinab-i-Mirza Aqa. I beseech God that He may aid him in that which is the cause of loftiness and elevation.\n\nYou mentioned the believers of Avaghuli and likewise their expressions of devotion and love - blessed are they, and joy be unto them. A tablet has been revealed mentioning the four souls who have turned to you, and the favors of the Most Exalted Pen encompass these four souls, nay rather all. We beseech God to assist them through His Cause, enable them through His sovereignty, and draw them nigh through the hosts of His grace. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAs for your mention of the believers of every land, all have been blessed with the effulgences of the light of grace, bounty, remembrance and praise. We have beseeched confirmation for all. Today steadfastness is the greatest of all deeds, for the words of the past have emerged - that is, the utterances of the detestable Shi'ih sect who each day, claiming love for the Successor, added to their oppression and pride until finally they martyred the Master of the Successor and the Lord of the Successor - nay, the One through Whose word a thousand successors were created. And now they mount the pulpits with their turbans and cloaks and, God forbid, occupy themselves with cursing and reviling Him. In any case, We enjoin all to purify their hearts from these names and free themselves from these fabricated stations which they have contaminated with their vain imaginings. Verily He speaks the truth and guides the way, and He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nWe have commanded his honor Aqa Siyyid A.H. Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, to proceed to 'Ishqabad for the sale of properties, and likewise Afnan A.L., upon him be the Glory of God, should go and do what is necessary for the payment of debts. O Amin, upon thee be My Glory! It is strange that until now no mention has been made of the kindnesses of his honor A.L., and you know that unless a matter is outwardly presented, no wisdom or expediency becomes outwardly manifest. In truth, the aforementioned soul has shown great effort and love regarding these persons. All must act in a manner befitting this deed. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to grant him an abundant reward and to open before his face the door of grace and bounty. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nSpecial Tablets were revealed and sent to the people of Avalughli. God willing, they will drink from the chalices of remembrance and the cup of utterance and the ocean of grace that lie concealed within the revealed verses. You mentioned Mirza Mihdi, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise mentioned his love and enthusiasm and his giving during nights and days. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! Time and again his mention hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to increase his service at every moment, and likewise his confirmation and success. Verily We have mentioned him before and mention him now as a mercy from Our presence and a bounty from Our part. Thy Lord doth witness and see and hear, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Mention was made of Haji 'Ali-Akbar and Aqa 'Ali-Akbar. Each hath attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. Reflect upon the ocean of God's loving-kindness, how He manifested A.H.M. and adorned him with the means of love and submission and contentment. The breezes of the verses that were sent down from the heaven of God's Will in his name have not ceased and will never cease. From the beginning of days until now he hath stood firm in service and hath spoken in remembrance. He and those with him all stand and are mentioned before the seat of the Wronged One. Soon shall the horizons of the world glory in his presence and his deeds and his remembrances, whereunto My perspicuous Book doth testify. Praise be to God! That honored one hath ever been and still is occupied with the mention of the friends of God in cities and lands. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having manifested me through Thy power and enabled me to serve Thee and caused me to speak Thy praise and illumined me with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom, by the mysteries of the Realm of Might and the lights of Thy countenance whereby the realm of creation was illumined, and by Thy Most Great Book which speaketh before the faces of the nations, to assist me and Thy loved ones to remain steadfast in such wise that neither the promptings of the evil ones, nor the doubts of the deniers, nor the insinuations of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment shall keep them back. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne and the penetrating power of Thy verses to ordain for Thy loved ones and Thy friends the reward of attaining Thy presence and standing before the gate of Thy grandeur. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Munificent, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\n=== END BH00771 ===\n\n=== START BH00772 ===\n\nIn the Name of the All-Hearing, the All-Answering!\n\nO peoples of the world! Fear ye the Ancient Lord Who hath appeared with the Most Great Name, and be not of the heedless ones. Verily the gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of Names hath come, riding upon the clouds. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe betide every remote oppressor. The Speaker of Sinai hath appeared and ascended the throne of Revelation, and the Divine Lote-Tree doth call out from the most exalted station: \"Verily there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful.\" Sinai hath been honored by the mention of the Lord of Names, yet the people remain in manifest veils.\n\nO Elijah! Hearken unto the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree; verily it hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison, as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Munificent, the Generous. He remembereth thee as He remembered thee before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and turned toward Him in days wherein every dubious learned one turned away - they who cast the Covenant of God behind their backs and committed that which caused \\[...\\] the Concourse on High and the dwellers of this glorious station to lament. We came from the Orient of Power with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We desired naught but to meet Our servants and to reform Our earth, yet the servants hindered Us - they who denied God's proof and His evidence, and opposed Him Who came unto them with manifest sovereignty. We beseech God to ordain for thee the reward of meeting Him and to decree for thee what He hath decreed for His loved ones. Verily He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nSay: Between Me and My loved ones have intervened the oppressors among My creation and the transgressors among My creatures, who have cast My Covenant behind their backs, hastening unto every remote ignorant one. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen reveal Its signs and the Ocean of Utterance Its pearls, as a mercy from His presence. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.\n\nWhen thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance and attain unto My verses, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having mentioned me, made me known, guided me, and caused me to speak. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion, by Thy sweetest call between Thy earth and Thy heaven, by the lights of Thy countenance and Thy throne, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the clamor of the servants nor the croaking of those in the lands shall deter me. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy Most Exalted Horizon, with the hands of my hope raised toward Thy heaven. O Lord of Names! I beseech Thee not to disappoint them through Thy generosity, Thy favors, Thy grace, and Thy gifts. Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all and Whose grace hath encompassed all. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful.\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have mentioned His Honor Elijah with a mention that shall endure in the Book of God. Praise be to God, the children of Abraham and the heirs of Moses have attained unto the fruits of the Divine Lote-Tree through the signs of the Most Exalted Pen. Well is it with them and may it bring them joy. Give them glad-tidings from Me, remind them of My verses, guide them to the ocean of My loving-kindness, and draw them nigh unto the heaven of My remembrance. In these days the fire of hatred is ablaze in this land, therefore We have forbidden pilgrimage. However, there hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will for him that which the world and all that is therein cannot equal. He should rejoice and thank his Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. As commanded, they should adhere to Islam and outwardly hold fast to the resplendent Law. This is better for them, as doth testify His manifest Book.\n\nThou didst make mention of Aqa Abu'l-Hasan of the Land of Ha. We have heard his call and answered him before, and at this hour, O My Name, the Countenance of the Wronged One is turned towards him from the Most Great Prison. Thou art witness that this Wronged One hath loved and continueth to love meeting His loved ones, but the transgressors with manifest tyranny have interposed and prevented it. From the beginning of this year until now, every day the fire of hatred hath blazed forth from the breasts of some, clear and evident. Therefore, hath the word of prohibition appeared from the horizon of the heaven of the Supreme Pen. Remember him on My behalf, give him glad tidings from Me, and illumine his heart with what hath been revealed for him from My Pen, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, and say:\n\n\"Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having strengthened me, made me know Thee, and enabled me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy inspiration. I beseech Thee by the land whereon the throne of Thy grandeur was established, and by the realms which were illumined with the lights of Thy countenance, to ordain for me, by the Pen of Thy bounty, the recompense of meeting Thee. Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou willest. Furthermore, I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the treasuries of Thy knowledge and the mines of Thy wisdom, to make me in all conditions cling to Thy cord, stand firm in Thy love, speak forth Thy praise, and hold fast unto the wisdom which Thou hast sent down in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. Thou art indeed the One with power, to Whose might all created things have testified, and to Whose strength all beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nO My Name, thou didst make mention of his honor Nawwab, upon him be My glory. His remembrance hath flowed and continues to flow from the Supreme Pen, both before and after. Praise be to God, he hath been successful in turning towards God, in steadfastness, certitude, and service to the Cause of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to aid him, confirm him, and so enkindle him that he may attract the moisture of heedless souls and guide them to the highest horizon. Some time ago, a Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of the favor of the Goal of all the worlds and was sent forth. In each word the ocean of grace was surging and the light of utterance was shining. We beseech God that they may drink from the ocean of divine meanings contained within the words of God that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Write and send what hath at this moment been specifically revealed for him from the Supreme Pen, that his eyes may be gladdened and his heart rejoiced. Verily thy Lord is the All-Commanding, the Ancient of Days. The glory which proceedeth from Us rest upon him and upon those who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.\n\nYou and the distinguished T were mentioned, and in these days a special Tablet was revealed for him wherein mention was made of you and the trusted one from the Supreme Pen. Praise be to God, they are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One and have attained His favors. That which the sister and the other sister, upon them be the Glory of God, had desired hath been accepted. Give them the glad-tidings of God's favors - their Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earth. Your honor should give them the glad-tidings of the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory. The Mother of the Friends hath been mentioned in numerous places and exalted Tablets from the Supreme Pen. In truth, that household hath ever been remembered before the Wronged One for their love, affection, mention, praise, acceptance and devotion. Blessed are they! We make mention of 'Ayn and Ta who have ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, and the Mother of the Friends, and We give them glad-tidings in the Most Exalted Paradise of My mercy, My favors, and My grace which have encompassed them. We beseech God to send down upon them at all times that which befitteth His name, the All-Merciful. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. You mentioned the honored 'Andalib, upon him be My glory. We beseech the True One to assist him and bestow upon him from the seas of His bounty and generosity that which beseemeth His giving. O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! 'Andalib, upon him be My glory, hath for numbered years been occupied with the mention and praise of the True One, exalted be His glory. His verses have been the cause of order and the gathering of scattered hearts, and his prose the cause of joy and gladness to receptive souls. Ask from the True One whatsoever beseemeth His bounty and favor. In these days mention of him hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen and been uttered by the tongue. The reward of deeds is preserved and treasured with God, and none hath knowledge thereof save His all-knowing Self.\n\n=== END BH00772 ===\n\n=== START BH00773 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, the All-Knowing!\n\nThis is a remembrance from God unto those who have shattered the idols of self through the fear of God, and have preserved God's trust within their breasts, and have been faithful to justice. God will soon aid them with hosts of angels and raise them to a lofty station of nearness.\n\nO Ancient Beauty! Remind the servants of what hath been revealed unto thee at this time, that perchance they may turn unto the sacred and generous pavilion. Say: O people! Fear ye God and spread not corruption in the earth, let none dispute with another, and be ye alone in God's religion. Beware lest ye make this world your homeland; rather, seek ye the homeland of eternal glory. Purify your hearts from envy and hatred that ye may meet your Lord, the Most Merciful, with a pure and sanctified heart. Then cleanse your tongues from abuse and backbite not those who have hastened with their feet and hearts unto the Ridvan of a glorious Name.\n\nSay: Those in whose hearts surge the seas of love, these shall not occupy themselves with the mention of contingent things and shall be drowned in the seas of detachment. When the verses of God are recited unto them, their eyes are humbled and their faces shine like luminous pearls. These are they who have aided God, their Creator, with what lay within their power, and God shall soon aid them with every wondrous victory.\n\nSay: O people! Fear ye God, then walk in the footsteps of these ones, follow not your own desires, take not partners unto God within yourselves, and follow not every ignorant multitude, but turn ye unto a beautiful and holy countenance. Then strive in God's religion that ye may understand God's Cause with your hearts and eyes, and follow not the paths of conjectural imitation.\n\nO people! Be ye ashamed before God and be not like those who turned away from His face and followed every rebellious satan. Walk ye in the ways of God which are straight with justice. Beware lest ye associate partners with God, differ not regarding God's laws, and be not tyrannical and wretched in the earth. Resolve the differences that have arisen between you and be steadfast brothers upon the thrones of unity.\n\nNow do I counsel you, and God is My witness between Me and you in this. Beware lest ye differ concerning that which ye were promised in the Book, which was irrevocably decreed in the Tablet. Know ye that He Who was named in the Bayan as \"Him Whom God shall make manifest\" shall come with truth in the next Resurrection, and God is the guarantor of this. He shall fulfill His promise and shall come on the day when the Lote-Tree of the Bayan shall rise to a sublime and lofty station. Then shall the Bird of Eternity warble and the Dove of Holiness coo, and God shall come in overshadowing clouds.\n\nThus do We impart unto you the truth and remind you with a most sublime and glorious remembrance, lest ye imagine in your hearts the imaginings of the ignorant, and stray from the Path, and be far removed from God's Kawthar.\n\nFear God, O people of the Bayan, and neither imagine vain things within your souls nor take anyone to be His peer, for that would be a grievous error. When the Promise cometh, verily He shall appear with the truth as He pleaseth, and shall create anew all who are in the heavens and on earth with a wondrous word of command, and shall render victorious whomsoever He willeth among His servants, and His triumph over the believers shall be nigh. Those who come before the Tree of the Bayan is raised up are evidence that there is no God but Him, and thus was the matter ordained. In those days no ordinance from among the ordinances hath appeared, and the tree that was planted in the Bayan by One All-Knowing, All-Wise hath not yet borne fruit. Nay, the tree hath not even brought forth leaves, how then its fruit, if ye be informed of God's decree. Know ye that before the seed sprouteth and becometh ears of corn, the time of harvest hath not come, if ye be discerning in the wisdom of creation. And when it putteth forth its shoot and thickeneth, reaching its full height, then shall the servants harvest it and live thereby for many days. Even so, recognize ye the decree of the Tree of the Cause when it reacheth its ultimate height and beareth wondrous fruits; then shall come He Who shall take its fruits, and without this it shall never be. God and His Prophets and Messengers are witness to this.\n\nTherefore glory be unto Thee, O my God! I seek Thy forgiveness at this moment for what my hands have wrought before Thee and what my pen hath set down, for Thou art indeed merciful unto Thy servants. For I, O my God, have set limits to Thy Cause wherein none should draw breath, how much more the limitations that arise from vessels of ignorance far removed. I bear witness at this moment that Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thy choice lieth not in anyone's hands; rather, Thou art the Chooser in whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art wise in all things. By Thy glory, O my God! If Thou shouldst desire to manifest the Embodiment of Thy Self at this very moment, Thou art assuredly powerful to do so, and of this I am possessed of clear certainty. I confess before Thee that Thou art the Omnipotent in Thy deeds - Thou manifestest what Thou willest and concealest what Thou willest, and Thou art powerful over all that Thou desirest. Thou shalt not be questioned about what Thou doest, and nothing shall prevent Thee from Thy will, and Thou encompasseth all things. By Thy glory, I have conveyed to Thy servants what I have found of Thy ways, lest they corrupt Thy Cause which Thou hast raised to a station of glorious praise. Therefore pardon me through Thy bounty, then forgive me and make me not doubtful in Thy Cause. Then enable me and Thy servants not to oppose Him in His days as they opposed Thy Most Exalted Beauty aforetime and this servant of Thine, for Thou art indeed cognizant of all that. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! I make peace with Thy creation before Thee that if they believe not in Thee on the day of Thy rising in the Manifestation of Thyself, they at least shall not oppose Him nor harm Him through their hands and hearts and through the envy and hatred within their souls, as I find today from everyone, young and old.\n\nO leaders of the Bayan! Fear ye God, and let not leadership prevent you from this bounty on this Day. Be not proud before God in what ye possess, but hasten ye to the shore of a wondrous Name. Trust not in that Day in your deeds or your actions, but trust in the grace that shineth from the horizon of holy radiance. Even now I witness that some among you take up prayer beads in your hands and make mention of God therewith, yet every morning and evening ye pronounce judgment against God Who created you. O leaders of the Bayan! Be fair with God within your own selves on that Day, and be not deceitful and mean. For by God, if ye believe not in Him in His Day and in this Servant Who speaketh for Him in truth in these days, nothing shall profit you, neither little nor much. Do ye turn away from the Truth and content yourselves that people should follow you? Evil indeed is that wherein ye traffic, and no gain shall ye derive therefrom, be it as small as a grain or a date-stone. By God, I would rather ye slay me in these days and I ask you not about my blood, than that ye should oppose God on the Day that shall truly come to pass. Then doth mine eye weep, and my heart quake, and my soul be troubled, and my hand tremble from that which these oppressors, all of them, bring upon Him. It behooveth me to complete what I say, for in all the kingdom there is no hearing ear save those who hear these verses and whose eyes overflow with tears in their love for God - and these are fewer than red sulphur in these days wherein the Name of God is sorrowful among the people. Husayn\n\n=== END BH00773 ===\n\n=== START BH00774 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise be to the peerless Creator Who created creation through His most exalted Word and made known to them that which harmeth and profiteth them, He Who hath need of nothing whatsoever. His mercy hath preceded all things and His grace hath encompassed all. Through pure bounty He adorned sheer nothingness with the ornament of being, and His purpose hath been the elevation of existence and its advancement, that through His destined decrees and all-encompassing favors they might become ready for the manifestation of His greatest bounty and most great mercy. Glorious is His grace and mighty is His dominion. There is none other God but Him.\n\nThe letter from that honored one was the cause of joy, nay rather it was the very essence of joy, for it bore testimony to that soul's degrees of sincerity, certitude, and well-being. After its reading and perusal, We repaired to the Sacred Spot and presented it before His countenance. He said: \"God willing, may you be mindful in all conditions, be observant of wisdom in association and gatherings, and conduct affairs through consultation. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make what hath proceeded from you a treasure for you, to preserve it through His power, protection, might and grandeur, to adorn your deeds with the glory of acceptance, to ordain for you the good of this world and the next, and to decree for you that which shall endure through the endurance of His Kingdom. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\"\n\nWe make mention of the loved ones in that land and convey Our greetings, counseling all to unity, wisdom and utterance. The honored Afnan, upon him be God's peace and grace, hath been and is mentioned; in all matters they should be mindful of liberality and bounty. The honored Observer, the honored Shaykh, and the son of the honored Samandar, upon them be God's peace and mercy, are mentioned. We have ever besought and continue to beseech the Truth that He may illumine hearts with the light of harmony and agreement, and confirm each one in that which leadeth to the exaltation of existence. Verily He hath power over all things.\n\nSome time ago this servant submitted a detailed letter laden with pearls of wisdom and utterance. God willing, it hath arrived and eyes have been blessed by it and light hath shone forth from the horizons of hearts. To those possessed of insight, the station of that heedless party hath ever been and shall continue to be evident. The decree for these matters came from the Island, and that heedless oppressor who promoteth his cause in that land - Dawlat-Abadi - hath committed that which no heedless one hath ever committed.\n\nO my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the sighing of the hearts of the oppressed, by the tears from the eyes of Thy near servants, and by the blood that hath been shed in Thy path, to aid the heedless to act with justice and the deniers to turn unto Thee and to face toward Thy Prophets and Messengers and to cling to the hem of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Forgiver, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nThis servant has ever beseeched and continues to beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His servants of that which is the cause of their glory and advancement, and not to withhold from them the light of truthfulness and uprightness. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nTo the honored presence of his eminence Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, I offer heartfelt praise, remembrance and greetings. In these days, his eminence the Afnan of the Land of Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, sent a letter to his honored eminence the Greater Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory. After it was presented before Him, He said: \"He hath spoken with justice. That which is mentioned therein must be carried out.\" We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before the faces of His Afnans the gates of favors and blessings. Verily, He is the Generous, the Merciful. End quote. Surely they will send the details thereof to them.\n\nThe most luminous star, his eminence Afnan, Aqa Mirza Mu?sin, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, has departed for the Land of Ha in perfect health and well-being. God willing, may he arrive at his destination in complete health and be assisted in that which is the cause of setting affairs aright.\n\nFurthermore, I convey greetings to the beloved of my heart, his eminence the Overseer, and the spiritual beloved, his eminence Shaykh, and the apple of the eye, the son of his eminence S.M., upon them be the Glory of God and His favors. May God assist them to achieve success, prosperity and righteousness. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous, and He is the Helper, the Merciful.\n\nAnother matter: The beloved of my heart, his eminence the Overseer, upon him be the Glory of God, has sent a letter to the beloved of the spirit, his eminence Haji Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God (in the Land of S), requesting a sum. The honored ones have written to this servant about this matter. After it was presented, He said that the spreading and publicity of these matters is not permissible. Moreover, it may not be outwardly possible for them, and may not be easily attainable. Regarding the amount requested, it was commanded that ten Ottoman liras be given to them specifically for the expenses of certain souls there, and the aforementioned amount that was promised should also be paid. For the sake of establishing justice and setting affairs aright, there has been and is no objection to this matter. Detailed instructions were written and sent regarding this, and this evanescent one has repeatedly heard from the blessed tongue, saying \"We love charitable giving.\" The attention to that direction has been for the sake of God, and whatever has occurred returns to Him. Therefore, there is no objection if that mentioned amount is given. What is essential is that God grant success so that those in authority may judge with justice. Surely the reward for deeds done with justice is not limited to what has been mentioned. Certainly from the treasury of the unseen will also be bestowed that which indicates His all-encompassing favor and His precedent all-pervading mercy. In certain instances, negligence is not permissible. Furthermore, the matter of certain ones remaining in that land and their movement depends on consultation. In all conditions, they must keep their gaze fixed upon the glory of the Cause. In this case, whatever occurs is beloved.\n\nAnd regarding the funds, what his eminence the Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, has mentioned is correct. The documents mentioned in his eminence's letter will be sent from the other direction.\n\nConcerning his honor Aqa Rasul, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and the other matters they have written about - this is acceptable. It is evident that his honor is diligent and striving in the duties assigned to him, and in all conditions holds fast to God's grace and attains His good-pleasure. This deserves a hundred thousand congratulations.\n\nRegarding his honor Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, several years ago they had expressed their wish to free themselves and obtain a divorce, but permission was not granted until these days when they said to do whatever they deemed advisable. That woman's actions were not and are not acceptable, to which the fair-minded ones of the world and the manifestations of His justice bear witness.\n\nConcerning the matter of the funds of Ibn Jenab Alif and Ha, upon them both be Baha'u'llah's glory - that is, the funds of Yapunchi - these were received through the honored Mr. Afnan 'Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of Baha'u'llah, and a receipt was issued. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God's loved ones there and upon God's righteous servants.\n\nThe Servant\n\n16 Rabi'u'th-Thani 1307\n\n=== END BH00774 ===\n\n=== START BH00775 ===\n\nThe Ever-Living, the Most Ancient\n\nRadiant praise, adorned, resplendent, ascending, and soaring to the atmosphere of the holy nearness of my Beloved Who, with but one melody from the songs of the celestial Dove, one warble from the eternal Nightingale, and one breath from the divine Bird, hath illumined all those who dwell in the clouds of unknowing with the brilliance of His holy splendor and adorned all scattered elements with the radiance of His intimate beauty. Yet He hath manifested but a single point from His Book of Glory, whereupon all have become deluded and lost, and have remained deprived of the mysteries and inner meanings of the verdant pavilions and the beautiful couches. They imagine themselves to be guided and righteous. Nay! By the Lord of the heavens, they are liars and corrupters! Now that the light of the morn of faithfulness hath sunk into the realm of the unseen, and the darkness of the night of blindness hath encompassed the face of the earth, such gloom hath descended from the friends upon the page of ink that its mere mention causeth sorrow to both the seen and unseen worlds. Glory be to God! To such a degree hath the emblem of grief appeared upon His countenance. Verily we are God's, and verily unto our Lord do we return. Say: O people of the Bayan! Were ye to awaken even slightly and ascend somewhat toward the holy heaven of the Eternal Sovereign, ye would realize how ye have divided the blessed, universal, and eternal Word. By Him Who is the Educator of the seen and unseen and the Sovereign of existence and Ultimate Goal, whatsoever your hands and tongues have wrought is evident and manifest before Him from Whose knowledge nothing whatsoever in the kingdoms of earth and heaven is hidden. Ye shall soon behold its fruits, and these same deeds and actions of yours shall return unto you at the time of return. Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him do we return.\n\nO my God, my Lord and my Beloved! I know not which decree Thou hast ordained concerning me, nor what Thou hast destined for my countenance. Dost Thou wish to abandon me among the oppressors among Thy servants? Here am I, present before Thee in faithfulness. Or dost Thou wish to take my soul in this house in utter abasement? By Thy glory! I seek no refuge save in Thy captivating beauty. Glorified art Thou, O my Beloved! I shall surely bear witness unto Thee in that hour before the countenance of the King of Thy munificence, and I shall surely call upon Thee in the sacred mysteries before the presence of the Sovereign of Thy holiness, that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thou hast ever been established in the mystery of Glory, and Thou shalt ever remain at rest upon the throne of the heavens. None can ascend to the atmosphere of the King of Thy attraction, nor can any soul mount up to the threshold of the Sovereign of Thy self-subsistence. All desire union with Thee and Thy presence, yet none hath the means to soar to the heaven of Thy divine unity, nor any proof to enter the precincts of intimate fellowship with the King of Thy divinity.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God and my Lord! Since I find no portion save in the warbling of Thy verses, and no glory save in the remembrance of Thy favors, I shall commune with Thee in this night before Thee with praise of Thine own Essence and attributes of Thine own Self, that perchance my heart may find peace amid the surging winds of sorrow for Thy loved ones, and my soul find rest amid the manifestation of the standards of grief from the people of Thy chosen ones.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou dost witness my state in this solitary house while Thy loved ones do with Thy countenance as they please. Thou knowest my secret amidst the letters of heaven while Thy chosen ones do with Thy glory as they desire. Thou hearest my cry in utter abasement while the pious think of Thee as they wish. Glorified, glorified art Thou! I see all this as naught but Thy doing unto me and Thy favor upon me. Thine is the praise in all of this, and Thine is the gratitude in all of this, for Thou art the Truth, there is no God but Thee, and we are all believers in this.\n\nPraise be to God Who hath enriched the Glory with the mystery of faithfulness, and hath seated him upon the crimson throne, and hath caused him to warble the verses of attraction on this sorrowful night, though most people neither witness nor give thanks. Praise be to God Who hath established the Light in the mystery of Glory, and hath made him witness from the divine realm among the countenances of heaven, and hath tried him among the hands of the polytheists in the realm of creation, though most people neither witness nor know. Praise be to God Who hath mounted me upon the steed of light, and hath established me upon the yellow rafraf of might in the most hidden essences of the Most Glorious, though most people neither see nor understand. Praise be to God Who hath caused me to ascend to the court of mighty divinity, and hath brought me into being at the radiance of the countenance of glory, and hath admitted me into the house of identity behind the veils of grandeur, though most people neither give thanks nor comprehend. Then after all this, they deny and say what they know not, and judge what they perceive not.\n\nO Dove of Eternity, Cock of Oneness, Bird of Glory, Manifestation of Divinity, and Radiance of Beauty! Say: O People of the Book! Why do you deny Us? Why do you reject Us? Are We not the verses of joy? Are We not the warbling of the Lord upon Mount Sinai? Why do you harm Us? How do you grieve Us? Are We not the hidden secret revealed in the Psalms? Are We not the countenance of the Ever-Living, the All-Forgiving? Are We not the mist of camphor? Are We not the clear signs of Oneness made manifest? Why do you drive Us from Our homes? Why do you imprison Us in Our dwellings? Are We not the Beauty of Glory in the darkness of night? Are We not the Beloved in the midst of the letter \"Ha\" with the hidden mystery? Are We not the Loved One in the heart of Glory with the melodies of resurrection? Are We not the Singer in the heaven of the heart with the warbling of birds? Why do you turn away from Us, slay Us, and forsake Us? By God, the Truth! There shall descend upon you the mighty, powerful grasp, and there shall appear unto you a severe, overwhelming punishment.

Glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved, my Companion, my Witnessed One! I seek Thy forgiveness at this moment for my transgressions before Thee and for my warbling in Thy kingdom. I am certain that all that hath been and shall be revealed is the description of Thy Self and none other, the mark of Thy mercy and naught else. O my God and my Lord! How can I seek Thy forgiveness for my grievous sins and my great transgressions, knowing that all this was naught but the warbling of the Dove of Thine eternity in my heart, the surging of the waves of Thy love in my breast, and the manifestation of the countenance of Thy identity in my heart? Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I am not an existence that I should implore before Thee, nor am I anything that I should mention myself before the court of Thy glory, nor am I a countenance that I should radiate in Thy kingdom, nor am I one who stands that I should raise the banners of Thy victory, nor am I a glory that I should shine in the heaven of Thy majestic manifestations, nor am I one who waits that I should await the days of Thy manifestation, nor am I one who sits that I should arise for Thy Cause, nor am I a presence that I should abide in the house of Thy glory. For all this was but the signs of Thy Self in Thy dominion and the tokens of Thy Being in Thy lands, and they shall never ascend to the heaven of Thy identity nor rise to the clouds of Thy oneness.

He it is Who warned the idolaters who broke the Covenant and Testament and gave glad tidings to the believers of what was ordained for them in the highest Paradise and the most exalted Garden. And upon His family and companions, whom neither land nor sea nor anything whatsoever prevented from striving in His path and exalting His Word.

After its reading and perusal, it attained the honor of being heard before His presence. The Master - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - said: \"O Afnan! Upon thee be My salutation.

They bore for the sake of God that which none other than them bore, and they strove in such wise as astonished all who were in the world, until the banner of 'There is none other God but Him' was raised to the most exalted station. From their might, the limbs of various parties trembled, and through the power of those souls the pavilion of glory was raised up and the Euphrates of wealth flowed. What happened to that power, and where did that might go, and in what corner has that authority hidden, and by what has that majesty been prevented? By God's life! The heedlessness of the people of unity became the cause of strength for the people of polytheism. Heedlessness reached such a state that the pen is impotent and falls short of its mention. Would that they were capable of hearing the cause and reason of what has occurred. By God's life! The recompense of deeds has become embodied and rendered the strong party weak. Today all must return, detached from all else, and beseech God - glorious be His majesty - that perchance the departed glory might return and the lost power might appear and the sun of unity might rise from behind the clouds and mist and illumine the world with a new adornment.\" His eminence Kabir - upon him be My peace and My peace and My favor - has ever been and is mentioned before the Wronged One and present before His face.

Praise be to God, they are occupied with service to the Afnan. We beseech from the Truth steadfastness and constancy for him. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer.\n\nPraise be to God! The light of grace is radiant and resplendent, and the rain of mercy flows and descends. Ever before the Lord has he been mentioned and favored with loving-kindness and affection. God is witness and testifier that this station is sanctified above the mention of this ephemeral one. Where is the mention of this ephemeral one compared to the mention of those souls who have attained true remembrance? In view of the manifestation of humility, submissiveness and sincerity, these words have appeared and continue to appear from such a servant. Our silence is preferable to our speech, and our quietude is more exalted than our utterance. In all conditions God is witness and testifier that the mention and praise of the honored master, the Most Great Afnan, may the Most Glorious Glory of God rest upon him, has never ceased from pen and tongue. Love for him is treasured in the heart. We beseech and implore God to gather all in the utmost joy and fragrance beneath the pavilions of grace, to bestow vision and revelation and hearing, and to confirm them. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. To those who circle round, meaning those souls who are present with your honor, I convey greetings to each one, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which will cause their elevation and exaltation. He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nAnother matter: His honor Aqa Mirza Majdu'd-Din, may my spirit be sacrificed for him, has arrived and become the cause of joy, happiness, gladness and delight. And according to what was mentioned, the apple of the eye, Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Mu??afa, may God's most exalted peace be upon him, has returned. What was sent has arrived. Ever has he been and continues to be mentioned, even as specifically in the presence they inquired of His Honor Majd, and loving-kindness was manifested from the Dayspring of Grace. Happy is he! God willing, may they be safe and attain to that which is befitting. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and upon those who love you and upon God's sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00776 ===\n\n=== START BH00777 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nA luminous remembrance from this servant to him who hath believed in God and been guided by the Sun that hath shone from the horizon of the Spirit, and who hath ascended unto God until he reached the station of nearness in the pavilion raised above the horizon of holiness, and who hath heard the melodies of the Dove upon branches planted by the hand of God in the paradise of the Divine Essence. Thus doth God exalt whomsoever He willeth through His command and abaseth those who have waxed proud before God and who this day are debarred from the beauty of God.\n\nO servant! Grieve not over anything, and fear no one. Place thy trust in God. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and unto Him returneth the decree, preserved in a Tablet from the hands of the oppressors. Say: O people of guidance! Should sorrow or tribulation touch you, rejoice within yourselves. And should the oppressors desire your body, surrender it unto them, that ye may don the crimson robe and mount the steed of the spirit, and soar in the atmosphere of destiny upon the winds of the divine command.\n\nThen preserve thyself and the souls of them who have believed in God and His signs according to thy capacity. And should destiny unveil the countenance of tribulation, be patient and content, that ye may walk in God's good-pleasure and tread the path of submission. All this is God's command and His decree, preserved in the pavilion of destiny upon a tablet concealed from eyes.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Follow not your selfish desires, and dispute not about the Cause of God. When a verse descendeth unto you, bow down in humility before it and be not among those who are puffed up with pride. This is what the servant counseleth you, advising you through a command sent down from the heaven of oneness through God's clouds.\n\nSay: O people! Consider those who came before you, how they met their end in heedlessness. Walk not in their ways nor follow their guidance. Rather, follow Him Who was raised up in the depths of light through God's nature. Turn not to any of the world's ornaments, nor to those in whose hearts ye find rancor against God and His loved ones. Hasten instead to a law sent down from the clouds of glory.\n\nThus do We turn you toward the traces of God's mercy and cast upon you from the wisdom that was, in the eternity of eternities, veiled behind the veils of light. Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves, and distance not yourselves from a paradise wherein blow the breezes of the celestial realm. Say: Those who would bar you from the path of immortality have no love within them and are recorded among the heedless on holy tablets by the Pen of the Spirit.\n\nThose in whose hearts is kindled the fire of love are deterred by nothing and held back by no command. They hasten with their very beings toward a station forbidden to the worlds. O essence of love! Should anyone ask thee what thou hast gained from thy journey, turn thy face from him and say: God hath sanctified our souls from all that ye have known, and we have attained unto a station recorded in the Mother Book in hidden script. We have soared in the atmosphere of reunion until we reached a city whose gates God hath shut against the likes of thee. Then seek God's help, and He will inspire thee in thy response with melodies of the immortal Dove, that thou mayest be enchanted by the holy strains.\n\nAnd thus do We impart unto thee mysteries of knowledge and wisdom, that thou mayest advance swiftly along the paths of divine recognition. Thus have We given thee glad tidings through the Spirit and cast upon thee meanings that were inscribed in the Tablets of the divine decree in the invisible realm. Therefore ponder what God hath shown thee in thy vision, then preserve it in the treasuries of thy heart and relate it not to those who have turned away and waxed proud, whose sole concern in this world is but to amass counted coins. When We impart unto them any mention, they turn away their faces - such is the measure of their understanding. Would the dung beetle desire to enter a garden wherein spiritual fragrances are wafting and sweet scents are diffused? Nay, by Him Who hath made me His servant, they will never incline unto it, but rather flee unto their own base selves which are consumed in a fire kindled by the faggots of idolatry. These are they who have cast the Word of God behind their backs, and Satan hath made their deeds seem fair unto them. Therefore hath God seized them for their sins and caused them to be burned in the fire of unbelief.\n\nO beloved! Hearken unto My call and take what We have inspired thee with by the hand of power, and be as a flame of fire that thou mayest ignite the fire in the hearts of those who have detached themselves unto God and whose breasts are consumed by the flames of longing. Then accept what We have enjoined upon thee in the Concourse on high and be not of those whose fire of divine love is extinguished in the valley of devotion. Say: Those who hasten unto good deeds in this fire are they whose hearts God hath tested for certitude and whom He hath distinguished with the robe of divine recognition from among the garments of understanding. The angels of the Cause receive them and teach them the ways of piety and give them glad tidings of mysteries that were mentioned in the Mother Book.\n\nSay: O people! This is but a servant of God, like unto any one of you, who calleth you unto a Paradise wherefrom the Spirit hath been bestowed upon the frame of all created things. He commandeth you naught save the pure truth, that He may bring you unto a knowledge that was raised aloft upon the Mount of Light. Say: Now hath the Face appeared from behind the veil, and the angels of the Spirit have descended, and God hath come upon clouds that were mounted in the heaven of holiness. Say: O people! Hasten unto God and fear no one, and despair not of the Spirit of God. This is what We have mentioned unto thee in this Book and made thee a bearer of glad tidings from Us unto all the worlds, that thou mayest waft the holy breaths upon hearts and remind them of days wherein verses descended from the clouds of grace in wondrous wise.\n\nAnd should the Name of God meet thee, spread these words before him that he may rejoice within himself and not be veiled from the gems of the Cause. And say unto him: Dost thou love thy head more than God? Say: Glory be to God! I love it only that it may be raised upon the spear in Thy love, if this be acceptable unto Thee. Or is thy breast dearer unto thee than God? Say: Glory be to God! I have preserved it only for the arrows of the enemies in Thy path, and this lieth manifest before Thee. Say: Fear no one and strip thyself of veils, for all good is in God's hands - He preserveth whom He willeth by His command, and His grace hath ever been witnessed by the worlds like unto this sun in the horizon above. Detach thyself from the world, then soar in the atmosphere of nearness and yearning, that thou mayest be even as the phoenix of longing, finding intimacy in the fire of God. These limited days shall pass away \\[...\\]\n\nReturn to a pavilion that was spread out before God from all eternity and say: Verily, we have loved Thee and made mention of Thee in the Concourse on High, yet found not from Thee the fragrance of love. Therefore have we made mention of Thee in the Tablet, that it might draw Thee unto a spot that was sanctified above the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. This is from the Dove of the Cause, warbling unto you with the melodies of Paradise, that it might render you entranced by the strains of God and bring you to the stream of life and shelter you beneath the shade of mercy that was stretched forth in the Garden of Eden. And we seal these words with the remembrance of the Beloved in the tabernacle of the heart, that the book of the Best-Beloved might be sealed with the seal of preservation. Then clothe with the robes of glorification, wrought of the silk of eternity, those in whose faces thou findest the light, and who abide forever in the garden of detachment.\n\n=== END BH00777 ===\n\n=== START BH00778 ===\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Lord my God! These are the days whereon Thou hast bidden all men to observe the Fast, that through it they may purify their souls and rid themselves of all attachment to any one but Thee, and that out of their hearts may ascend that which will be worthy of the court of Thy majesty and may well beseem the seat of the revelation of Thy oneness. Grant, O my Lord, that this fast may become a river of life-giving waters and may yield the virtue wherewith Thou hast endowed it. Cleanse Thou by its means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils of the world have failed to hinder from turning towards Thine all-glorious Name, and who have remained unmoved by the noise and tumult of such as have repudiated Thy most resplendent signs which have accompanied the advent of Thy Manifestation Whom Thou hast invested with Thy sovereignty, Thy power, Thy majesty and glory. These are the servants who, as soon as Thy call reached them, hastened in the direction of Thy mercy and were not kept back from Thee by the changes and chances of this world or by any human limitations. I am he, O my God, who testifieth to Thy unity, who acknowledgeth Thy oneness, who boweth humbly before the revelations of Thy majesty, and who recognizeth with downcast countenance the splendors of the light of Thy transcendent glory. I have believed in Thee after Thou didst enable me to know Thy Self, Whom Thou hast revealed to men's eyes through the power of Thy sovereignty and might. Unto Him I have turned, wholly detached from all things, and cleaving steadfastly unto the cord of Thy gifts and favors. I have embraced His truth, and the truth of all the wondrous laws and precepts that have been sent down unto Him. I have fasted for love of Thee and in pursuance of Thine injunction, and have broken my fast with Thy praise on my tongue and in conformity with Thy pleasure. Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have fasted in the daytime, who in the night-season have prostrated themselves before Thy face, and who have repudiated Thy truth, disbelieved in Thy signs, gainsaid Thy testimony, and perverted Thine utterances.\n\nOpen Thou, O my Lord, mine eyes and the eyes of all them that have sought Thee, that we may recognize Thee with Thine own eyes. This is Thy bidding given us in the Book sent down by Thee unto Him Whom Thou hast chosen by Thy behest, Whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favor above all Thy creatures, Whom Thou hast been pleased to invest with Thy sovereignty, and Whom Thou hast specially favored and entrusted with Thy Message unto Thy people. Praised be Thou, therefore, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast graciously enabled us to recognize Him and to acknowledge whatsoever hath been sent down unto Him, and conferred upon us the honor of attaining the presence of the One Whom Thou didst promise in Thy Book and in Thy Tablets.\n\nThou seest me then, O my God, with my face turned towards Thee, cleaving steadfastly to the cord of Thy gracious providence and generosity, and clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies and bountiful favors. Destroy not, I implore Thee, my hopes of attaining unto that which Thou didst ordain for Thy servants who have turned towards the precincts of Thy court and the sanctuary of Thy presence, and have observed the Fast for love of Thee. I confess, O my God, that whatever proceedeth from me is wholly unworthy of Thy sovereignty and falleth short of Thy majesty. And yet I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast revealed Thy Self, in the glory of Thy most excellent titles, unto all created things, in this Revelation whereby Thou hast, through Thy most resplendent Name, manifested Thy beauty, to give me to drink of the wine of Thy mercy and of the pure beverage of Thy favor, which have streamed forth from the right hand of Thy will, that I may so fix my gaze upon Thee and be so detached from all else but Thee, that the world and all that hath been created therein may appear before me as a fleeting day which Thou hast not deigned to create.\n\nI moreover entreat Thee, O my God, to rain down, from the heaven of Thy will and the clouds of Thy mercy, that which will cleanse us from the noisome savors of our transgressions, O Thou Who hast called Thyself the God of Mercy! Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent.\n\nCast not away, O my Lord, him that hath turned towards Thee, nor suffer him who hath drawn nigh unto Thee to be removed far from Thy court. Dash not the hopes of the suppliant who hath longingly stretched out his hands to seek Thy grace and favors, and deprive not Thy sincere servants of the wonders of Thy tender mercies and loving-kindness. Forgiving and Most Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord! Power hast Thou to do what Thou pleasest. All else but Thee are impotent before the revelations of Thy might, are as lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth, are as nothing when compared with the manifestations of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and are destitute of all strength when face to face with the signs and tokens of Thy power. What refuge is there beside Thee, O my Lord, to which I can flee, and where is there a haven to which I can hasten? Nay, the power of Thy might beareth me witness! No protector is there but Thee, no place to flee to except Thee, no refuge to seek save Thee. Cause me to taste, O my Lord, the divine sweetness of Thy remembrance and praise. I swear by Thy might! Whosoever tasteth of its sweetness will rid himself of all attachment to the world and all that is therein, and will set his face towards Thee, cleansed from the remembrance of any one except Thee.\n\nInspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy wondrous remembrance, that I may glorify Thy name. Number me not with them who read Thy words and fail to find Thy hidden gift which, as decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and which quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the hearts of Thy servants. Cause me, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have been so stirred up by the sweet savors that have been wafted in Thy days that they have laid down their lives for Thee and hastened to the scene of their death in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty and in their yearning to attain Thy presence. And were any one to say unto them on their way, \"Whither go ye?\" they would say, \"Unto God, the All-Possessing, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!\"\n\nThe transgressions committed by such as have turned away from Thee and have borne themselves haughtily towards Thee have not availed to hinder them from loving Thee, and from setting their faces towards Thee, and from turning in the direction of Thy mercy. These are they who are blessed by the Concourse on high, who are glorified by the denizens of the everlasting Cities, and beyond them by those on whose foreheads Thy most exalted pen hath written: \"These! The people of Baha. Through them have been shed the splendors of the light of guidance.\" Thus hath it been ordained, at Thy behest and by Thy will, in the Tablet of Thine irrevocable decree.\n\nProclaim, therefore, O my God, their greatness and the greatness of those who while living or after death have circled round them. Supply them with that which Thou hast ordained for the righteous among Thy creatures. Potent art Thou to do all things. There is no God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.\n\nDo not bring our fasts to an end with this fast, O my Lord, nor the covenants Thou hast made with this covenant. Do Thou accept all that we have done for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and all that we have left undone as a result of our subjection to our evil and corrupt desires. Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy good pleasure, and preserve us from the mischief of such as have denied Thee and repudiated Thy most resplendent signs. Thou art, in truth, the Lord of this world and of the next. No God is there beside Thee, the Exalted, the Most High.\n\nMagnify Thou, O Lord my God, Him Who is the Primal Point, the Divine Mystery, the Unseen Essence, the Dayspring of Divinity, and the Manifestation of Thy Lordship, through Whom all the knowledge of the past and all the knowledge of the future were made plain, through Whom the pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were uncovered, and the mystery of Thy treasured name disclosed, Whom Thou hast appointed as the Announcer of the One through Whose name the letter B and the letter E have been joined and united, through Whom Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty and Thy might were made known, through Whom Thy words have been sent down, and Thy laws set forth with clearness, and Thy signs spread abroad, and Thy Word established, through Whom the hearts of Thy chosen ones were laid bare, and all that were in the heavens and all that were on the earth were gathered together, Whom Thou hast called 'Ali-Muhammad in the kingdom of Thy names, and the Spirit of Spirits in the Tablets of Thine irrevocable decree, Whom Thou hast invested with Thine own title, unto Whose name all other names have, at Thy bidding and through the power of Thy might, been made to return, and in Whom Thou hast caused all Thine attributes and titles to attain their final consummation. To Him also belong such names as lay hid within Thy stainless tabernacles, in Thine invisible world and Thy sanctified cities.\n\nMagnify Thou, moreover, such as have believed in Him and in His signs and have turned towards Him, from among those that have acknowledged Thy unity in His Latter Manifestation--a Manifestation whereof He hath made mention in His Tablets, and in His Books, and in His Scriptures, and in all the wondrous verses and gem-like utterances that have descended upon Him. It is this same Manifestation Whose covenant Thou hast bidden Him establish ere He had established His own covenant. He it is Whose praise the Bayan hath celebrated. In it His excellence hath been extolled, and His truth established, and His sovereignty proclaimed, and His Cause perfected. Blessed is the man that hath turned unto Him, and fulfilled the things He hath commanded, O Thou Who art the Lord of the worlds and the Desire of all them that have known Thee!\n\nPraised be Thou, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast aided us to recognize and love Him. I, therefore, beseech Thee by Him and by Them Who are the Daysprings of Thy Divinity, and the Manifestations of Thy Lordship, and the Treasuries of Thy Revelation, and the Depositories of Thine inspiration, to enable us to serve and obey Him, and to empower us to become the helpers of His Cause and the dispersers of His adversaries. Powerful art Thou to do all that pleaseth Thee. No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all men!\n\n=== END BH00778 ===\n\n=== START BH00779 ===\n\nIn the name of the All-Powerful Creator! Praise and glory befit that Lord Who, through His might, delivered creation from the nakedness of nothingness and adorned it with the raiment of life. He chose the pure essence of man from among all created things and arrayed him with the garment of grandeur. Whosoever hath cleansed the mirror of his heart from the rust of desire hath become worthy of this divine raiment and hath delivered himself from the nakedness of ignorance. This raiment is the greatest source of ease and education for the bodies and souls of men. Blessed is the day when one, through the aid of the one true God, hath gained freedom from the defilements of the world and all that is therein, and hath reposed beneath the shade of the Tree of Knowledge.\n\nThe song of the nightingale, warbling upon the branches of the Tree of Love, hath reached the ears of the friends. Therefore was this servant bidden to answer certain questions and to reveal such mysteries as were permitted to be unveiled. In that cherished letter it was asked which of the Manifestations had precedence over another. Here the one true God declareth: \"We make no distinction between any of His Messengers.\" For their purpose is one and their mystery the same. To establish distinctions or precedence between Them is not permissible. The true Prophet hath called Himself by the name of the Prophet that preceded Him. Thus when one faileth to comprehend the inner meaning of these words, he uttereth unseemly speech. The seeing sage is not misled by such utterances.\n\nThough Their appearance in the world be not identical, and each is manifested with distinct conduct and behavior, appearing between degrees of lesser and greater, yet They are like unto the moon in heaven which, though it appeareth in different phases, never suffereth diminution or cessation. Thus it is known that this is not a matter of increase or decrease, but the contingent world requireth such varying conduct. For whenever the matchless God sent forth a Prophet unto mankind, He was manifested with such words and deeds as befitted that day.\n\nTwo purposes underlay the divine appearance of the Messengers: first, to deliver mankind from the darkness of ignorance and guide them to the light of true understanding; second, their well-being and the knowledge of the ways leading thereunto. The Prophets are even as physicians engaged in healing the world and its peoples, that through the remedy of unity they may cure the disease of discord. In the doings and prescriptions of the physician there is no room for objection, for he is aware of the constitution of the body and its ailments, and never can the bird of human understanding soar to the height of his knowledge. Therefore, if the physician's treatment today differeth from that of the past, there is no cause for objection, for each day the patient requireth a different remedy. Similarly, whenever the Prophets of God illumined the world with the resplendent Sun of Divine Knowledge, they summoned the people unto the one true God through whatever was befitting to that day, and led them from the darkness of ignorance to the light of understanding. The eye of the wise must therefore be fixed upon their inner mystery, for the purpose of all hath been one: the guidance of the lost and the tranquility of the distressed.\n\nO friends, enlighten the people! Strive to clothe all with the garment of enlightenment and free them from the fetters of the darkness of ignorance. Again, it has been written that some consider themselves leaders and carry out whatever they measure by the scale of knowledge. Although the peerless God has lit the lamp of reason for mankind and made it their source of guidance, none can reach any station without education, just as an infant, if not nourished, will not attain what is befitting. The One Lord declares: We reveal nothing without its essence. Therefore, people must have education, and for them no end is apparent in elevation and progress. Not all who hasten attain excellence, and each day hath its own requirement. O wise one, if there were a measure apparent for human knowledge, then following would be fitting. Therefore, one must strive to seek those above oneself and follow their bidding. When weighed in the balance of knowledge, none save God's Messengers possess this lofty station. For this reason have the learned ones believed in the words of the Prophets and found in them the means of liberation and guidance for humanity, for their knowledge hath no apparent measure. Should We wish to elaborate on this theme, the letter would grow weary and the pen would have no strength to write. If you ponder the words of the wise ones, especially Galen the learned, the truth of this utterance will become evident.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the conduct of the followers of religions with one another, He declares in the new commandment: Associate with the followers of all religions with friendliness and fellowship. The divine commandments have always called people to the path of friendship and kindness, but people have followed some and abandoned others, engaging in their own imaginings, remaining deprived of the Word of the Lord and distant from the hearing of the people. Therefore, if the wise ones of the earth would observe the Word of the Creator with seeing eyes and ponder with intelligence and wisdom, they would inevitably discover its inner meanings and abandon the confused utterances of others.\n\nMoreover, the seventh question the merciful Lord has answered in His commandment, the Persian of which is this: It is not permitted to compel anyone in matters of religion. Truth hath been distinguished from error. Therefore, whosoever believeth in God, turning away from others, hath grasped the divine cord of guidance and been delivered from the depths of darkness. Never hath it been permissible to force people into God's religion. When the world-illumining Sun of God enlightened the world, after some time people forgot the divine commandments and conducted themselves unseemly. For if today someone from among the followers of a Prophet's religion were to drink wine, it is evident that this was not the desire of that pure Essence. Likewise, observe in all things - some have misunderstood God's commandments and engaged in unseemly deeds. O friends, the sayings of the ancients and the ways of those gone by are not worthy of this triumphant day. People have been afflicted with illness; strive to deliver them through that remedy which is fashioned by the mighty hand of the divine Physician.\n\nAgain, regarding the nature of religions, it has been written that the wise ones of the world have likened the world to the human body. Just as it needs clothing, so must the body of the world be clothed with the garment of knowledge. Thus is religion of God its garment. Whenever it becomes worn out, He adorns it with a new garment. Each time hath its own appropriate way. Always doth the divine religion appear and become manifest according to what is befitting for that day.\n\nNoble knowledge should shun the vain utterances found in the writings of past religionists. The One Creator hath created all people equal and hath conferred upon them superiority over all created things. Therefore, elevation and abasement, increase and decrease, depend upon one's endeavor. The more one strives, the further one advances. We cherish the hope that, through the aid of the Lord, the dewdrops of bounty will cause the tulip of knowledge to spring forth from the soil of the heart and cleanse humanity from the darkness of impurity. As to certain questions contained in the letter, the pen hath not ventured to answer them, for it is not fitting at this time - as the Arab sayeth, not all that is known should be said, nor is every saying timely. God willing, We shall address these matters in writing when it is deemed appropriate.\n\n=== END BH00779 ===\n\n=== START BH00780 ===\n\nWhat has befallen the Tree, its branches and leaves hath caused the Cause of God to be exalted, yet the people remain behind a veil and covering. Whatsoever harm hath come upon Us, We have made it a means of exalting God's Cause, the Lord of creation. We have knowledge of what hath befallen them in the path of God, and We have sent down for each one of them that which shall solace their eyes. Give them the glad tidings that their names were mentioned before the Throne. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

He is assuredly among the righteous. No more is permitted in this letter. Gladden ye all through the favors of God. All names have been revealed in the Tablets and have been and shall be under the glance of His grace. They must walk with the utmost wisdom lest anything occur that might cause the weak to stumble. If they act according to what hath been revealed from the Pen of the Cause, they shall soon witness all people turning towards it.\n\nConcerning the two persons mentioned, their petition was presented before the Face, and this is what was sent down from the heaven of Will: O Aziz! Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to recognize Him and for having given thee to drink of the pure wine in the days of His Manifestation, and for having aided thee to turn unto Him after every contumacious infidel had turned away. Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the sun of Thy Revelation shone forth from the horizon of Thy Will, and which Thou hast made to hold sway over all who are in Thy earth and heaven, to make me detached from all else save Thee and to fix my gaze upon the horizon of Thy grace and bounties. O Lord! Thou art the Rich and I am the poor. I have raised my hands of supplication to the heaven of Thy grace and my eyes await the wonders of Thy mercy. Send down upon me from the heaven of Thy generosity that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. Verily, Thou hast ever been established in Thy transcendent might and power. I testify that Thy power hath encompassed all worlds. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nO Aziz! This is a Day wherein if thou wouldst turn with the ear of nature unto the rock, thou wouldst hear it proclaim: \"The Day is come and the Promised One hath appeared with manifest sovereignty.\" The power of thy Lord hath encompassed all contingent things. Ask thou of Iraq those who walk the path of fairness and thou shalt be assured that He hath appeared with all the signs. He hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. When thou hast attained unto that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, say: Praise be to Thee for having sent down unto me that which shall cause me to endure in the kingdom of names and shall establish my remembrance among the righteous.\n\nO Razzaq! Thy letter hath come before the Face and We found from it the fragrance of thy love for thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. We have pardoned what is past and have sent down for thee that which shall cause spirits to soar. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Soar thou in My atmosphere, make mention of My Name and voice My praise among My servants in such wise as to transform the servants when the breezes of the All-Merciful waft over thee from this Book which hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance. Turn with thy heart to the Qiblih of all possibility. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God and my Beloved! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self, the Dawning-Place of Thy Beauty, and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee not to shut me out from Thy gate which Thou hast opened unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. O my Lord! Aid me to love Thee in such wise that I may be content with Thy good-pleasure, moved by Thy command, and in all conditions be turned toward the realm of Thy grace and bounty, immersed in the ocean of Thy knowledge which hath appeared through Thy Most Great Name, from every drop of which can be heard: \"There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\"\n\nBlessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as thy mention hath been made from this glorious horizon. Say: He desireth naught for Himself. I summon you from this prison unto God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: O people! Ponder upon God's ambassadors of the past and this Cause through which the standards of His Command have been raised. Beware lest ye deny Him through Whom the eyes of them that are nigh unto God have been solaced. When thou hast drunk the Salsabil of divine exposition from the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know Thee.\n\nHad circumstances permitted, unique and sublime Tablets would have been revealed and sent unto all. However, due to the clamor of the heedless and the croaking of the polytheists, this brief message shall suffice. We send greetings and glorification to all the loved ones in the land of Ba and ?ad. Blessed are they, for their names have been mentioned before the Presence. This, verily, is a great bounty.\n\nRegarding the attestation of Shaykh Muhammad, We beseech God to strengthen him at all times according to what his Lord, the All-Merciful, hath willed, to cause the Salsabil of life to flow from his tongue, and to enable him to make mention of Him and praise Him among His servants. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned concerning the imprisoned one, he is indeed imprisoned as his Lord was imprisoned. Blessed is he for having followed His example. None of the souls dwelling in that land are commissioned to teach; rather, all must conduct themselves among the servants with spiritual qualities and praiseworthy attributes that will engender the love of people. This much sufficeth. Should any soul utter words that cause disturbance to another in that land, the harm will rebound upon all. Surely forbid the servants from such mentions that cause people to become alarmed. As for their expression of distress and desire for permission to proceed elsewhere - since each of the friends and associates in that land has no connection save through thee, praise be to God that thou hast attained unto this relationship, and this sufficeth.\n\nConcerning what was mentioned about the child: Blessed art thou for having sacrificed him in the path of God. Indeed, it hath been revealed in one of the Tablets, these words - exalted be His glory: \"Were the Word of God to be confined to a single word, the books of all the worlds could not equal it.\"\n\nBe not grieved at Our having abbreviated the Tablet, for therein is seen a mighty Book. This is a Tablet mingled with the salt of God; when thou hast tasted it and discovered its savor, arise and say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds! Marvel not if We jest in prison, for grief hath never overtaken Us in the path of thy Lord, and We are in wondrous joy. We have indeed sacrificed one of the Branches. Say: Thine be the praise, O Glory of the worlds! Would that thou knewest the surgings of this Most Great Ocean and what lieth therein of the pearls of thy Lord's mysteries, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nIn this Cause thou hast followed the truth. Well is it with thee for having attained thereunto. Let nothing grieve thee in the love of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou engaged in the service of the Cause with the utmost dedication. All matters shall, God willing, be set aright if He so wisheth and decreeth. Be thou patient, for He is verily the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nThe matter which is of the utmost importance in the sight of God is that all should strive to unite souls, that all may become united and in truth abide in perfect love, harmony and unity. This matter hath been revealed in most of the Tablets. Blessed are they that act accordingly.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Rida. We beseech God to aid him in the service of his Lord. He hath rendered and continueth to render many services. These shall surely not remain without fruit and recompense. Give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him, for He is the best of them that remember.\n\n=== END BH00780 ===\n\n=== START BH00781 ===\n\nZein, upon him be the Most Great, Most Ancient Glory of God!\n\nYour letter reached the Most Great Vision, and that which you asked concerning the divine verses, this servant present before His face sends to you. O Zein, the delay in answering what you asked about the verses has been for the preservation of change, for in the early days there was absolutely no consideration of the people's rules at the time of revelation, while in these days it is observed out of wisdom. Therefore, if a Tablet from before is read in the presence of the Face, it descends in some stations differently than what was revealed before. This refers to the outward expression, but in reality whatever was revealed was and will be correct.\n\nIn the Land of Mystery, it was intended that rules in divine knowledge be revealed so that all might be informed. Due to the sorrows that descended, the successive occupations, and the consecutive trials, it was delayed. Another greater reason was that any ignorant one might compose fabricated words and people, considering those rules, would deem them correct, even though if asked about it himself, he would not know a single letter - as you observe in Yahya and his followers.\n\nKnowledge is in His grasp; He turns it how He wishes. For example, in some places a verse that according to outward rules should be in the nominative or genitive case is revealed in the accusative case. In this instance, either \"kana\" is implied, or similar accusative particles and their positions. And if somewhere it is revealed in the genitive while according to common practice it should not be, in this case the genitive particle or the possessive construct that causes the genitive is omitted. Apply this rule universally.\n\nLikewise, in some instances it relates to the style of verses - We do not wish to mention rhyme in this station. Similarly, according to the leaders of grammar, an intransitive verb appears in transitive form in three ways: through repetition, with \"ba\", and with \"hamza\". This is respected among the people, but in divine knowledge, by contextual evidence, an intransitive verb becomes transitive and a transitive verb becomes intransitive. Blessed are those who know, and blessed is he who is certain that all sciences are in the grasp of his Lord's power, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nSimilarly, a transitive verb, for example like \"rafa'a\" is revealed as \"arfa'a\", and examples of this existed in heavenly books before. This is for emphasis - there is no harm in it. O Zein of the near ones, the Manifest Beauty is afflicted between two parties. If creation were to become aware in what state the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen is raised, and in what tribulation the Tongue of Grandeur speaks, all would cast off the garment of existence and seek the adornment of non-existence.\n\nFor a thousand years and more there was dispute and contention among Islamic scholars about whether God or another is the originator of words. Now, despite the appearance of Truth in what has been revealed from Him, they have objected and continue to object, as did Karim-i-Kermani and likewise the scholars of the age who have made countless objections to divine words, as you have heard. Although similar matters were revealed before, yet musk becomes more fragrant the more it is repeated. Most Tablets were revealed at times when there was no opportunity to review them. Whatever flowed from the pen of this servant present before His face was distributed to all regions, therefore it is possible that in some places things were omitted and \\[...\\]\n\nO thou who asketh concerning excess and deficiency! Know that no one hath the power to fully record that which is revealed at the moment of its revelation. That which is asked concerning these stations hath been and shall ever be beloved, though to the Prisoner the new revelation is more beloved than returning to what was revealed before, and attention to it is easier, and He is the Master of causes.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked concerning the meeting, be patient, for thy Lord is the All-Patient. For just as this land hath become the dawning-place of the Chosen One and the habitation of the righteous, likewise hath it become the source of the wicked and the abode of the impious. For every truth there is falsehood, yet despair not of God's spirit and mercy. When He willeth, He changeth all through His word \"Be!\" and it is. We testify that thou art among those who have attained the presence of God, associated with Him, heard His call, and stood before His Most Great Gate. Grieve not over anything; remain steadfast in thy condition, for the Cause is mighty, mighty indeed.\n\nBehold the weakness of the people who, despite the manifestation of truth, power, majesty and His signs, have been kept back from the Lord of Oneness by artificial words of the past and vain imaginings. By My life! They are among the losers. Woe unto those who turn to them and hear what they possess. Blessed are they who are detached. This Most Great Revelation - the Truth alone is established upon the throne. Whosoever pondereth upon this Most Great Revelation and the dawning of the Ancient Beauty will testify to this Manifestation, whereby is established the sanctification of His Essence from any likeness and the purification of His Self from any resemblance.\n\nObserve the people of the Bayan who are in truth worshippers of names and vain imaginings. With their tongues they profess His oneness, yet whoever pondereth on what they say will testify that they are among the idolaters. Hence the sum of their deeds hath become turning away from the Truth. Upon them be what they deserve.\n\nConcerning the Hidden Words which thou didst mention - some were revealed at one time in a single tablet, while others were revealed at different times. Some have gathered them all together, while others remain scattered. It would be best if they were all gathered together, in the estimation of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.\n\nRegarding inheritance, that which the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath commanded is beloved. Whatever exists of those entitled to portions, let them divide their wealth among themselves. For those below this rank, the matter must be referred to the Most Holy Court. The command is in His hands - He ordaineth as He pleaseth. In this connection, a decree was revealed in the Land of Mystery, and the portions of missing persons were temporarily assigned to existing heirs until the establishment of the House of Justice. After its establishment, its ruling shall become manifest. However, the inheritance of those who emigrated in the year in which the Ancient Beauty emigrated shall return to their heirs. This is from God's bounty unto them.\n\nThe possessions of Jinab-i-Mulla Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, rightfully revert \\[to God\\], for he is among those martyred in His path and those who have attained His presence. Blessed is he for having fulfilled God's Covenant and Testament. By My life! He hath attained the lights of the Countenance and hath drunk the choice wine of life from the fingers of his Lord's bounty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Send to the Most Holy Court even a small amount of his ink, though it be as small as a chickpea, and the remainder is bestowed upon you. Look not upon its outward unworthiness, for with God it hath a distinguished station. He, verily, is the All-Loving, the All-Forgiving. Should anyone return to Iran, write concerning Jinab-i-?a', upon him be the Glory of God, informing the Trustee. Pause in what thou wast commanded regarding the matter of the handmaidens. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed art thou, O Zayn, in thy steadfastness in the Cause of thy Lord. We testify that he is among the sincere ones. We send him Our greetings from this most exalted, most glorious Station, and We beseech God to protect him from those who have disbelieved, to assist him in His service in every circumstance, and to ordain for him what He hath ordained for His chosen ones. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. May the Glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those who are there, from this Captive, this Exile. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00781 ===\n\n=== START BH00782 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, the All-Knowing\n\nThis is a remembrance from God unto those who have shattered the idols of self through the fear of God, and have preserved God's trusts within their breasts, and have been faithful through justice. God shall soon assist them with hosts of angels and raise them to a lofty station of nearness. O Ancient Beauty! Remind the servants of what hath been revealed unto thee at this time, that they may turn towards the sacred and generous canopy. Say: O people! Fear ye God and spread not corruption in the earth, and let no one dispute with another, and be alone in God's religion. Beware lest ye make this world your homeland; rather seek ye the homeland of eternal glory. Purify your hearts from envy and hatred that ye may meet your Lord, the Most Merciful, with pure and sanctified hearts. Then cleanse your tongues from reviling, and backbite not those who have hastened with their feet and hearts unto the paradise of a glorious Name. Say: Those in whose hearts surge the oceans of love shall not occupy themselves with the mention of contingent things, and shall be drowned in the seas of detachment. And when God's verses are recited unto them, their eyes are humbled and their faces shine like luminous pearls. These are they who have aided God, their Creator, according to their capacity; God shall soon aid them with every wondrous victory. Say: O people! Fear ye God, then walk in the footsteps of these ones, and follow not your own desires, and take not partners unto God within yourselves, and follow not every ignorant rabble, but turn ye unto a beautiful and holy countenance. Then strive ye in God's religion that ye may understand God's Cause through your hearts and eyes, and follow not the paths of vain imagination and blind imitation. O people! Be ye ashamed before God and be not like those who have turned away from His face and followed every rebellious devil. Walk ye in the paths of God which are straight through justice. Beware lest ye associate partners with God or differ regarding God's commandments, and be not tyrannical and wretched in the earth. Rather, resolve the differences that have arisen between you and be as brothers firmly established upon the thrones of unity. I counsel you at this moment and take God as witness between me and you. Beware lest ye differ regarding that which ye have been promised in the Book, which hath been irrevocably decreed in the Tablet. Know ye that He Who hath been named in the Bayan as \"Him Whom God shall make manifest\" shall come with truth in the next Resurrection, and God is the guarantor of this. He shall fulfill His promise and shall come on the day when the Lote-Tree of the Bayan shall be raised to a lofty and glorious height. Then shall the Bird of Eternity warble and the Dove of Holiness coo, and God shall come in overshadowing clouds. Thus do We impart the truth unto you and remind you with a sublime and glorious remembrance, lest ye entertain in your hearts the imaginings of the ignorant, and stray from the Path, and become far removed from God's Kawthar.\n\nFear God, O people of the Bayan, and do not indulge in vain imaginings within yourselves, nor take anyone to be His equal, for this is indeed a grievous error. When the Promise comes, verily He shall appear with the truth as He willeth, and shall create anew all who are in the heavens and on earth with a wondrous word of command. He shall assist whomsoever He willeth among His servants, and His help is ever nigh unto the believers. They who come before the Tree of the Bayan is raised up are proofs that there is none other God but Him, and thus has the matter been decreed. In those days no ordinance from among the ordinances hath appeared, nor hath the Tree which was planted in the Bayan by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, borne fruit. Indeed the Tree hath not even put forth leaves, how then could it bear fruit, if ye be informed of God's decree? Know ye that before the seed sprouts and becomes ears of corn, the time of harvest hath not arrived, if ye be discerning in divine wisdom. When it puts forth its shoot and becomes strong and reaches its fullness, then do the servants harvest it and live thereby for many days. Similarly, know ye the decree of the Tree of the Cause: when it reaches its ultimate height and bears wondrous fruits, then cometh He Who shall take its fruits, and without this it shall never be, and God and His Prophets and Messengers are witness to this.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I implore Thy forgiveness at this moment for what my hands have wrought before Thee and for what my pen hath set down, for Thou art indeed merciful unto Thy servants. For I have, O my God, set limits to Thy Cause wherein none should draw breath, how much more the limitations which arise from vessels of ignorance far removed from Thee. I testify at this moment that Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thy choice lieth not in anyone's hands; rather, Thou art the Chooser of whatsoever Thou pleasest, and Thou art wise in all things. By Thy glory, O my God! If Thou shouldst desire to manifest the Exponent of Thy Self at this very moment, Thou art assuredly powerful to do so, and of this I am possessed of clear certitude. I confess before Thee that Thou art the Powerful in Thy deeds, manifesting what Thou willest and concealing what Thou willest, and Thou art powerful over all that Thou desirest. Thou shalt not be questioned about what Thou doest, and nothing can prevent Thy will, and Thou encompassest all things. By Thy glory, I have conveyed to Thy servants what I have found of Thy ways, lest they corrupt Thy Cause which Thou hast raised to a station of glorious praise. Therefore, pardon me through Thy grace, then forgive me and make me not doubtful in Thy Cause. Then enable me and Thy servants not to oppose Him in His days as they opposed Thy Most Exalted Beauty aforetime and this servant of Thine, for Thou art indeed cognizant of all this. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! I make peace with Thy creation before Thee that if they believe not in Thee on the Day of Thy manifestation in the Exponent of Thy Self, at least they shall not oppose Him nor harm Him with their hands and hearts and with the envy and hatred that lie within their souls, as I find today from every lowly and great one.\n\nO leaders of the Bayan! Fear God, and let not leadership prevent you from this grace in this Day. Be not proud before God in what you possess, but hasten to the shore of a wondrous Name. In that Day, put not your trust in your deeds and actions, but trust in the grace that shines forth from a holy and resplendent horizon. Even now I observe that some among you hold prayer beads in your hands and make mention of God with them, yet every morning and evening you pronounce judgment against God Who created you. O leaders of the Bayan! Be fair with yourselves before God in that Day, and be not deceitful and mean. For by God, if you believe not in Him in His Day and in this Servant Who speaks of Him with truth in these days, nothing shall profit you, be it little or much. Do you turn away from the Truth and content yourselves that people should follow you? Evil indeed is that wherein you traffic, and your profit therein is not worth a whit or atom. By God, I would rather you slay me in these days and I ask you not about my blood, than that you should oppose God in the Day that shall, in truth, come to pass. Then do mine eyes weep, and my heart quake, and my soul be troubled, and my hands tremble by reason of what hath befallen Him at the hands of these oppressors, all of them. It behooveth me to complete these words, for in all creation there is no hearing ear save those who hear these verses and whose eyes overflow with tears for the love of God. And these are fewer than red sulphur in these days wherein the Name of God is grieved among the people.\n\n=== END BH00782 ===\n\n=== START BH00783 ===\n\nIn the Name of my Best Beloved, the Most High!\n\nThis is a Book from this humble one who calls all who are in the heavens and earth unto his Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Say: Verily, in the boiling of the seas, the flowing of the rivers, the alternation of night and day, the manifestations of oneness in the garments of light, the blowing of winds, and the signs of creation in the fruits, are signs for those possessed of sight. Say: O concourse of earth! Behold ye the signs of God's power, how He created all who are in the heavens and earth by one word from His Pen, and breathed into them the spirit of life by another word. Thus do We impart unto you what was concealed in the depths of the ocean of mysteries. He sent 'Ali before Muhammad and revealed with him clear signs which every possessor of knowledge and power is powerless to understand. Thereby was the earth of knowledge cleft asunder, the heavens of wisdom were split, the clouds of grace were raised up, and the rain descended upon you. All this is a reminder to you of the truth and a lesson to those possessed of understanding, guiding those who are detached unto the precincts of holiness, while it increaseth naught for the wrongdoers save loss.\n\nSay: O people! This is what God promised you in the Tablets. He hath come to you upon clouds of fire, surrounded by angels of the spirit, giving you glad tidings of the good-pleasure of oneness in that seat wherefrom the lights shine forth. Those who were given the vision of justice by the decree of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, turned unto Him, while those in whose breasts was rancor against God turned away and were of those who disbelieved in God in every age and epoch. This is what hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen upon tablets traced by the finger of God, the Protector, the Compelling.\n\nSay: O people! Be fair unto yourselves for less than a moment and ponder thereon, O ye possessors of thought! If ye believe not in Him Who hath come with clear signs, then to what face will ye turn today, O possessors of justice? Have ye not heard aforetime of the Day when your Lord or some of the signs of your Lord would come? And this is He Who hath come in the shadows of light with signs that render powerless all who are in the heavens and earth, signs that stupefy the minds of the mystics and the hearts of the righteous.\n\nSay: O people! Arise from the couches of heedlessness and turn unto God, the One, the Powerful, the All-Wise. Say: Verily in the creation of your souls, the utterance of your tongues, and the movement of your hands are signs for those possessed of vision. Say: O people! Let not the world and its ornaments prevent you, nor what hath been sent down upon you from every proud doubter hinder you, and fear not those whom God hath given power only over your bodies for numbered days, that He may test which of you in the kingdom is most patient and enduring. All this hath not been sent down upon you save by what was ordained in the Preserved Tablet by measure and destiny. Soon shall pass away all tribulations that have touched you in less time than it takes for vision to return unto you. Fear God and be afraid of Him Who hath power over you, over your souls and bodies. None can prevent His command. He doeth what He willeth and is not asked of what He willeth. He is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nSay: Those who have been patient in the earth, God shall soon reward them with the most excellent of rewards. They shall ride upon the crimson Steed and shall pass at all times through every region and quarter.\n\nSay: O people! This is the She-Camel of God, grazing upon what God hath caused to grow for her in the land of Paradise, giving you to drink of the milk whereby souls and bodies are quickened. O people! Wrong her not through the evil of your own selves, and follow not your selfish desires, but follow Him Who calleth you unto God. Then remember Him in your hearts in the night seasons and at dawn. Say: Doth it not suffice you that He hath sent down unto you the Book wherein every matter is distinctly set forth, which is recited unto you at eventide and at daybreak, and which giveth you the glad tidings of the Day when the faces of the wrongdoers shall be covered with the dust of the fire, when the mountains of knowledge shall crumble, when the earth of unbelief shall be cleft asunder, and when rivers shall burst forth? Say: This is the Day whereof ye were promised in the Tablets, when the heavens shall be folded up in the right hand of Power, when the earth shall be grasped by the hand of Will, and when the seas shall be set ablaze. This is what the Pen of Command hath inscribed from the hidden mysteries with manifest clarity. Then shall those nigh unto God rejoice at the meeting with their Lord, while every proud deceiver shall be shaken. The angels of light shall lead those who have believed unto the Paradise of perpetual abode in the pole of heaven, while the angels of torment shall drive those who have disbelieved unto a most evil dwelling place. Thus do We cast upon thee from the mysteries of the Cause, and recount unto thee what they who disbelieved did aforetime, even as these transgressors now disbelieve, that thou mayest be apprised of what was decreed before and mayest be steadfast in God's Cause in such wise that no disbelieving denier may cause thee to slip. Know thou that those who were given the Torah were promised One Who would come after. Yet when Jesus came unto them with clear signs from the Spirit, they said: \"This is naught but a lying man.\" Then those who possessed the Gospel were given glad tidings of One Who would come after them. Yet when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came unto them, every deceitful dissembler waxed proud against Him. Ask, then, concerning those who were given the Furqan: When the Apostle came unto them from God, they said: \"This is naught but a sorcerer.\" Yet when He returned to the holy seats beneath the canopies of grandeur, they began to yearn for Him at all times and to supplicate Him night and day. Thus did they who came before - before whom there was none - and thus shall they continue to do unto the end - beyond which there is no end. This is what We have recounted unto thee concerning those who disbelieved and turned away after clear proofs came unto them from every direction, and who plotted against God according to their power. But the plotting of the unbelievers endeth only in ruin. Even as thou seest today: When He came unto them with the truth with clear proofs and scriptures, they said: \"We were not promised this by our forebears.\" Then they grew proud against Him and fled like frightened asses. Such is their portion in the kingdom, and thus hath Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them, such that they perceive not what they say. Thus have We informed thee of all things with clarity, that thou mayest be among those endowed with insight. Say: Consider likewise those who were given the Bayan: Should anyone come unto them with manifest signs, clear proofs, brilliant evidences, comprehensive words, and luminous verses, they would shut their eyes to all of this, break God's covenant, turn upon their heels, and would accept him only with flying arrows. By this thou canst be certain that in all dispensations the true believer hath been as rare as red sulfur. This is what hath been sent down from the heaven of the Spirit upon the hearts of the righteous.\n\nSay: O people! Should ye come to possess all the treasures of earth, and should ye rule over all that lieth beneath the light of the sun, and should ye partake of every fruit that hath appeared upon the trees, and should ye don every robe that hath been woven of silk and attire in all the lands, and should ye take possession of every virgin maiden - by God! none of these things shall profit you in the least when the angels of death shall come unto you from a compelling and almighty Lord and shall sever you from all these things in less than the twinkling of an eye, as though ye had never been created in the kingdom. This is a truth that hath been inscribed in the scrolls by God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. Thus have We prescribed unto you the law of admonition and shown you the paths of holiness and taught you the ways of Paradise and imparted unto you the wisdom of the Cause that ye may draw nigh unto the Mighty, the All-Powerful. Say: O concourse of earth! Whoso willeth, let him take this counsel as a path unto God, and whoso willeth, let him turn away and return to his abode in the fires of hell. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened unto the melodies of the Spirit and ascended unto the station of resplendent holiness.\n\n=== END BH00783 ===\n\n=== START BH00784 ===\n\nHe is the Glorious in the Most Glorious Horizon!\n\nThis is a Book which speaks with truth, and God hath made it the sign of His Revelation and the sovereign evidence of His Cause between the heavens and the earth, and verily He is powerful over all things. It beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and that 'Ali is the Manifestation of His Self among all the worlds. Verily His glory is His manifestation, then His concealment, and His might and honor and proof unto all who dwell in the kingdom of creation and command, and thus hath His mercy encompassed all the worlds. Verily those who have denied God and His signs, these have no station, and these are debarred from this heavenly spring.\n\nO people! Fear God and dispute not concerning His Cause, and follow not those in whose hearts ye find hatred toward this Beauty Who hath appeared in the Temple of Trinity in the form of Unity, made manifest. Beware, O people, lest ye cast the Book of God behind your backs. Follow ye the religion of God and His Faith, and verily today it is My love, and God is witness unto this. And when ye adorn the temple of faith with the raiment of My love, render thanks unto God for having aided you in this, and verily there is no God but Him, His is the creation and the command, and all are preserved with Him in the Tablets.\n\nHearken, O people, unto the call of your Lord from this crimson Tree upon the Spot of Eternity in the paradise of your Lord, the Most High! God! There is no God but I, and verily I have been standing at the right of the Path of Truth, and I witness those who pass over it - among them are those who pass like lightning from the clouds, and among them are those who pass upon their breasts, and among them are those who pass upon their feet, and among them are those who pause before it, and thus do We witness them and We are witness unto this.\n\nO Pen of Command! Make mention of those servants who have entered the precincts of Paradise, the station wherein lights are witnessed from its horizon. Among them are those who have attained the presence of the Throne and have heard the melodies of God, and were numbered among the successful ones in the Mother Book, written by the Pen of the Spirit. And among them are those who have believed in God but were not enabled to enter the sanctuary of Grandeur, the station which God hath sanctified from the knowledge of all creatures combined. For each is a portion in the Book of thy Lord, and none comprehendeth this save him whom God hath aided in His Cause and made him among those who are assured in the Mother of Tablets.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of Our servant Joseph who entered the Sinai of the Cause and heard the call of God from the upraised Lote-Tree on the shore of the crimson sea of glory: \"Verily, I am God, there is none other God but Me, and I have ever encompassed all created things.\" O servant! Give thanks unto God for having blessed thee with the recognition of the Manifestation of His Self, and for having brought thee into the presence of the Throne, and for having caused thee to hear such melodies as have attracted the realities of all things between earth and heaven. Thus hath the bounty of thy Lord encompassed all. O servant! Arise to promote the Cause with steadfastness from Us and power from Our presence, and fear thou no one, for We shall protect thee from every wicked oppressor. Say: Fear God, O people, and take not any lord besides Him for yourselves. Then shatter the idols of fancy and desire through My Most Exalted Sovereignty. This would be better for you, did ye but know it. Soon will Satan enter among you and bid you to hate the Youth. Wherefore, seek refuge in God and draw not nigh unto him. This is what God commandeth you, and He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth with manifest authority. Say: Today naught shall profit anyone save through love for Me, even should they bring all the books of the world. Draw not nigh unto them from whom ye cannot detect the fragrance of the All-Merciful, though they bring you numerous tablets. O Joseph! Arise from thy slumber, then remind the people of that which the Spirit hath inspired thee with in this Tablet that hath encompassed the worlds. Know thou that whatsoever thou hast heard hath proceeded from Me, and what We have indicated referreth to none but Me. This is of the wisdom that hath been concealed from the worlds. Know thou further that he who was created by My command and was given life by My Word hath risen against Me and turned away from God and denied His signs and rejected His proof, and was accounted among the idolators. Beware lest the world and all that is therein prevent you from that which hath been ordained for you in the heaven of exalted glory. Gird up thy loins to assist God and His Cause, then to serve God and His glory. Thus doth the Pen of Glory command thee from the kingdom of transcendent might. Say: Faces have turned black wherefrom the lights of love for my Most Glorious Lord will never shine forth, and eyes have been blinded that will never turn toward the court of His great mercy, and tongues have been silenced that will never move in His sweetest remembrance, and souls have ceased to exist that will never arise to aid this Cause which hath shone forth from the horizon of holy splendor. Thus have We taught thee that thou mayest know the way of thy Lord, lest any sinful denier lead thee astray.\n\nMake mention also of the Letter M before Ja'far, that he may remember within himself and be among those who remember in these days wherein the servants were debarred from the holy shore. Say: O servant! We showed thee in a dream aforetime that which would guide thee to the path of thy Lord. Arise then at the bidding of thy Master and summon the people to this Cause before which every lofty mountain hath been leveled. Be thou a herald of the Cause among Our servants, then gather them together in My love, for this indeed is a great thing in the Book. Beware lest anything prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord. Cast the world behind thee, then take up for thyself a secure station beneath the shadow of thy Lord. Say: O people! Dispute not concerning the signs of God when they are sent down in truth, and follow not those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were deprived of the melodies of God. Follow what the Spirit imparteth unto you, then answer the call of God's herald among you, then summon the people to the Most Great Pilgrimage which was made manifest in the temple of the Youth.\n\nThen cast your gaze upon the face of him who is named Mirza and give him glad tidings of his Lord's favors, that he may rejoice in his soul. Thus have We commanded thee in truth, that God's grace may encompass His servants who dwell beneath the shelter of this Cause. O servant! Remember thy Lord at eventide and at dawn, and establish for thyself a station which is praiseworthy before the Throne. Blessed art thou for having attained the presence of thy Lord and for being among those who circle round this House that encompasseth all worlds. Shun Mine enemies and associate not with them, and remain safely guarded. By God! Whoso remaineth steadfast in My love, God shall make him powerful over all things and shall raise him up before the Throne in the Most Great Paradise with such beauty as shall shine with the light of glory. Be thou so firm in the Cause that the words of those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God and have strayed far from the shore of justice shall not cause thee to slip. Then convey greetings to those who have attained the presence of the Throne and to those who have not attained the presence of God, but whom God hath accepted and will reward abundantly from His grace, and will provide for them from the heaven of His Cause such bounties as have been sent down from the clouds of the Spirit. Thus have We inspired thee and wafted unto thee the fragrances of the All-Merciful from the breath of the All-Glorious, that thou mayest be steadfast in the path of thy Lord with great strength. And the Spirit and glory and splendor be upon thee and upon all, young and old.\n\n=== END BH00784 ===\n\n=== START BH00785 ===\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!\n\nO My Name!

We make mention of thee with that which hath mentioned thee and with that which shall gladden the eyes of them that are nigh. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, and that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been revealed. That which was concealed in the Books of God and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen hath appeared, and I am the All-Knowing Expositor.\n\nO Hasan! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee at this moment that thou mayest hear the call of thy Lord from the Most Exalted Horizon and thank Him for this great favor. The letter thou didst send to My Name, upon whom be My glory and loving-kindness, hath come, and from it We have inhaled the fragrance of thy turning and thy submission to God, the Goal of them that know. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee to remember and praise Him, and to know, with true knowledge, that for which thou wast created. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Baqir, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, and We reveal unto him the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds, that they may draw him to the Most Exalted Horizon and bring him nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O Muhammad-Baqir! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He mentioneth thee from the precincts of the Prison and summoneth thee to the straight path of God. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the days of God, the tongue that hath spoken His praise, the face that hath turned toward the light of His countenance, the ear that hath heard His call, and the heart that hath turned unto Him when every distant scholar and every doubting mystic turned away. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having sent down the proof and made manifest the way, and for having called the servants unto Thy most exalted horizon and supreme summit - the station wherein Thy sweetest call was raised and the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha was heard. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, by the pavilion of Thy majesty which was raised above the most exalted standards through Thy command and power, and by the manifestations of Thy loving-kindness and the breezes of Thy days, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause, clinging to Thy cord, speaking Thy praise, and standing in service to Thy loved ones. O Lord! Aid me to rend asunder the veils of glory, to dispel that which is vain imagination, and to attain unto clear understanding, that I may remain firm in Thy love and steadfast in Thy Cause. Then ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the world to come, and that which shall be a light unto me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. The forces of the world cannot withhold Thee. Thou art, verily, the Strong, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nMoreover, I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy most exalted Words and Thy greatest signs, to elevate the station of Thy servant who was named Ahmad and who was martyred in Thy path, yearning to attain Thy presence. We testify that he acknowledged Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that which the tongue of Thy grandeur did utter, and was so moved by the thrill of Thy most exalted Word that he offered up his spirit in Thy path and attained unto that which was hidden in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Bless him and those whom the affairs of the world did not prevent from turning to Thy most exalted horizon, who heard the scratching of Thy Most Glorious Pen and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Goal of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Adored One of the nations, for having manifested Thyself and for that which Thou didst promise Thy servants.\" Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful from eternity. There is none other God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nO Hasan! Upon thee be my Baha! Hearken thou in the Persian tongue to the divine call, that perchance the people of the earth may hear it and attain unto their purpose. Today the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the flowing of the Most Exalted Pen are raised high. This is the Day concerning whose triumph all sacred Books have testified, and for Whose appearance all have besought God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized this Day and found its purpose.\n\nConcerning what thou didst mention about the Spirit \\[Christ\\], the Most Exalted Pen doth at this moment testify that all His acts - whether sitting or standing, sleeping or waking, moving or still, speaking or silent - whatsoever proceeded from that Manifestation, all were proof and were distinguished above the deeds of all who dwell on earth. They who are possessed of insight and they who occupy the Most Sublime Vision have borne and do bear witness to His dominion, power, sovereignty and greatness. May all in the kingdom be a sacrifice unto Him!\n\nO thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and inquireth about the Ocean! Reflect upon this Manifestation: though untutored, having attended no school nor engaged in scholarly discourse, suddenly the Light of wisdom and utterance dawned from the horizon of His Most Exalted Pen. The oceans of knowledge and understanding surge at His will. From the outset, without veil or concealment, He spoke the Most Great Word before the faces of divines and princes. Whence appeared this power, and from what dawning-place shone forth this grandeur? By God's life! It hath appeared above the comprehension and understanding of men. Yet out of grace and mercy, He at times appeareth in such vesture as may enable men to draw nigh and attain to that which shall ensure their salvation and life. The revealed Books have testified and do testify to this truth. Consider thou the Surih of Ra'is and likewise the Surih of Kings, that thou mayest, according to thy capacity, become aware and attain unto this testimony. Indeed, testimony in this station is preferable to all deeds. We beseech God to assist thee and to vouchsafe unto thee the wine of steadfastness from the ocean of His bounty. He is the All-Bountiful One Whose generosity the disobedience of His servants hath not withheld, and Whose munificence the rebellion of creation hath not veiled. Through His name the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" hath been raised aloft, and the standard of \"He ordaineth what He pleaseth\" hath been unfurled. Reflect upon that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Most Exalted Pen, and arise to serve the Cause through teaching the people and refining souls. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee and draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is. Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him shall we return.\n\nThe souls mentioned in the letter have attained the grace of God, and mention of each hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. I swear by the Luminary of Power which shineth and is manifest from the horizon of the firmament of the Prison, that whoso attaineth unto a single word and preserveth the station of that word, he hath attained unto all good. No bounty can equal the verses of the Most Exalted Pen, and no deed can match their glory. Beseech ye God that He may not deprive all the peoples of the earth of this grace, that He may guide them to His Most Great Ocean and make them aware. He is the Powerful, the Omnipotent. The Glory shining from the horizon of My celestial Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the cord of the Command and clung to the hem of the robe of their Lord's mercy, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Bountiful. The Book hath ended, but the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, endeth not, though all the pens, ink, and paper of the earth be exhausted. We counsel thee and those who have believed to that whereby the remembrance of My party shall endure in My Book and their deeds in My lands. O people of God! Upon you be the glory of God, His mercy and His grace. Know ye the station of this Day and Him Who speaketh therein, manifest and evident, Whom neither the politics of the world nor the oppression of nations hath deterred, nor have all the peoples of the earth prevented Him from raising His call. It behooveth you to hold fast unto trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and purity. Blessed is he who hath heard My call and acted according to that which was commanded in My Book, and hath spoken My beauteous praise. The Command is in the hands of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat.\n\n=== END BH00785 ===\n\n=== START BH00786 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful\n\nO Javad!

This Wronged One hath testified, and doth testify, to thy remembrance and praise, to thy rising up to serve the Cause, and thy turning toward the lights of His countenance. The travelers and emigrants have each made mention of thee. Some time ago thy letter was received, and from it wafted the fragrance of sincerity and steadfastness. Blessed are they whom the idols of vain imaginings have not debarred from the lights of the Daystar of certitude. We testify that thou hast attained unto the mention of God and the traces of His Most Exalted Pen, and hast arisen to serve the Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the wicked nor the onslaught of the evil ones deterred thee. Rejoice in what hath proceeded from the Tongue of Grandeur in thy praise.\n\nThe whole world was brought from utter nothingness into being for the recognition of the Ancient King, yet when the Sun of Truth shone forth and He Who conversed on Sinai was seated upon the throne of manifestation, they turned away. Would that they had been content with that! Nay, they committed that which caused the hearts of the sincere ones to be consumed and the lamentations of them who are nigh unto God to be raised. The Divine Lote-Tree bewailed the tyranny of the divines, and the Most Exalted Pen wept. O Javad! Thy letter was a faithful witness to thy devotion and steadfastness. Well is it with thee and with those who are with thee, and woe betide them who denied the proof of God and His signs, and who disbelieved in His grace after it was sent down, and in His Cause after its manifestation.\n\nGlory be to God! Until now the Shi'ih sect remain unaware. The cry hath been raised, all things proclaim, the mountains echo the trumpet blast, and the Pen of the Ancient of Days speaketh, yet still they lift not their heads from the couch of heedlessness. God's favor toward thee hath been great indeed, and still is - none can reckon it save Him Who knoweth and counteth all things. He confirmed thee and guided thee to the straight path, made thy house a place of coming and going for the emigrants, and enabled thee to serve His Cause over the course of years. Thou hast ever been, and still art, beneath the glance of His loving-kindness. Ask thou God to preserve what He hath bestowed and to protect it from thieves and traitors.\n\nWe make mention of thy wife and give her glad tidings of My loving-kindness, My mercy and My favor which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. O My handmaiden and daughter of My handmaiden! This day at dawn, this Wronged One proceeded from Bahji to the garden, for there the bearer of the name of generosity had spread a feast. After arrival and taking seat and partaking of tea, the Most Exalted Pen engaged in mention of the loved ones, His face turned in attention, His gaze in observation, and His hearing in attentiveness. How wonderful is this most great favor and this supreme bounty!\n\nAnd We make mention of Ahmad and give him glad tidings of the ocean of his Lord's mercy, the Most Generous, the Bountiful. Thou art he who heard the Call when it was raised, and drew nigh, casting aside idle fancy on the Day of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Thou didst take hold of that which thou wert commanded to take hold of. He Who spoke before all faces beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. Thou didst drink the wine of mystic knowledge on a day when all authorities, all learned ones, and all mystics were debarred therefrom, save whom God, the Possessor of all being, willed. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy father and upon those women who have attained unto My days and drunk the Kawthar of My love. We beseech God to strengthen them and draw them near in all conditions. Verily He is the Powerful over what He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nO friend! If thou wert to attain unto a single fruit of the divine Book, thou wouldst soar upon the wings of longing. I swear by the Finger of Power which rent asunder the veils and tore away the coverings, were all the peoples of the world to discover the station of but one of the handmaidens who hath heard from the Tongue of Grandeur the words \"O My handmaiden\", they would all proclaim the blessed words \"Glory be to God and praise be to God!\"\n\nO Azziyyih! Upon thee be My glory! Thy mention hath been made. Remember thou those days when thou didst hearken unto the call of God, exalted be His glory, and didst witness His verses. The divines of the world were created for recognition, understanding, witnessing and hearing, yet all remain veiled and deprived, while thou, without veil or covering, hast attained and art blessed with beholding the Most Exalted Horizon by night and by day. O Azziyyih! Thou wert with Us and didst hear what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered, and didst witness what no eyes have witnessed save whom thy Lord wished. Give thanks unto God and remember His mercy, His loving-kindness, His compassion, and His sanctification and exaltation above all who are in the heavens and the earth.

The days do not warrant the sending of letters to that place. Vain imaginings have seized most of mankind. By God! They are in a wondrous sleep. We desired mercy and rest for them, yet they desired torment for Us. I make complaint of My grief and sorrow unto God, the Lord of all beings.\n\nO physician! Upon thee be My salutation! We have read thy letters and understood their contents, and We have read the letter of Afnani wherein mention was made of thee. In days such as these, We have abandoned speech and chosen silence, lest there appear that which would raise the clamor of every remote ignorant one. We make mention of God by night and by day, while the people fabricate against Us that which their desires command them. Know ye that they are among the heedless. We beseech God to aid His servants unto pure sincerity and unto acting in accordance with what hath been sent down in My perspicuous Book. They have said that which hath caused the dwellers of the realm of fidelity to lament and the people of this noble station to cry out. We send Our greetings to My loved ones and counsel them with that which will exalt their stations, and We beseech God to assist them in doing good. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nWe make mention of Abdullah. His letter was previously presented and read by the Servant who is present. We have made favorable mention of him. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, to make him speak His praise, to be enkindled with His love, and to hold fast unto that which beseemeth the people of divine unity in these days wherein the smoke of hatred hath risen from all sides and the righteous are in great distress. The wicked have made the great city - and by this We mean in this instance Alexandria - a target for their cannons, whereat eyes have shed tears, hearts have been troubled, the sacred valley hath lamented, and the Hijaz hath cried out. O Abdullah! It behooveth thee and every believer who hath believed in God and His signs to beseech your Lord, the All-Merciful, by night and by day, that He may bring forth that which hath been stored away and raise up the people of divine unity through His bounty, generosity and favor, preserve them from the evil of His enemies, and grant them victory from His presence.

Hearken unto that which the Dove of Identity warbleth unto you from the uttermost heights of Its ecstasy in the love of God and the pinnacle of Its passionate longing for God, Its self-effacement and Its subsistence in God, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling. Fear ye God and dispute not concerning the Cause of God, worship none but Him, and spread not corruption in the land of divine knowledge. Then accept the counsel given unto you by this Servant, upon whom the arrows of destiny have rained down from the crimson clouds in such measure as none can reckon save God, and none can comprehend save Him. Have mercy, O people of the earth, and burn Him not with the fire of your selves, harm Him not with the suspicions of your idle fancies, imprison Him not in the jail of your heedlessness, slay Him not with the swords of your hypocrisy, and drive Him not away with the spears of your tyranny and fetters, inasmuch as He hath called you to naught save God and will never summon you except unto the Manifestations of His Self and the Mirrors of His Being, and by Him Who standeth in the station of His Cause. Say: Fear ye God, oppose not the truth, and transgress not the essence of counsel. Know ye that whosoever spreadeth corruption in this good and blessed land, upon him be the curse of God; whosoever raiseth his hands without God's good pleasure or without permission from His presence, upon him be the curse of God; whosoever moveth his feet without obedience to God, he is deprived of God's mercy; whosoever taketh his hands from his pockets and followeth his desires, casting the Cause of God behind his back, he is excluded from God's shadow even should he dwell in the precincts of God's sanctuary; whosoever breatheth or speaketh according to his desires in this land wherein the countenance of God hath been established, he is bereft of the wonders of God's grace; whosoever severeth not himself from all that are in the heavens and on earth cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; whosoever followeth his desires and attributeth them to God, he is deprived of the gardens of God's loving care; whosoever harboureth in his heart aught save the love of God can never enter the City of God; whosoever conveyeth a message to anyone without God's permission, upon him be God's vengeance; whosoever spreadeth God's words before anyone without being authorized by God, upon him be God's might. Say: Fear ye God, this is the holy land wherein the Spirit of Oneness hath removed Its sandals to enter therein. Whosoever conceiveth corruption against it in his heart hath turned away from the face of God; whosoever guardeth not his tongue, his feet, his hands and all his members, from his heart to his vitals, upon him be the vengeance of God; whosoever slayeth a soul without explicit permission from God hath transgressed the Cause of God, and whosoever transgresseth the Cause of God, upon him be the curse of God; whosoever backbiteth another and the sun riseth upon him for three days while he hath not repented unto God, he is debarred from the presence of God; whosoever lieth down at night upon his bed while harboring hatred in his heart for his believing brother, glad tidings unto him of God's vengeance and chastisement. Block not the way for the wayfarers, and close not the doors of bounty in the faces of the poor, lest \\[...\\]\n\nYour faces are the gates of God's bounty, and whoso entereth not the garden of submission and resignation hath departed from the stronghold of God, and whoso departeth from God's stronghold is blind to the vision of God's light. Say: Fear ye God and spend upon your poor what God hath ordained for you, then seek God's help that He may send down upon you the rains of His mercy. And if ye desire to enter the abode of peace, surrender yourselves and purify your hearts and illumine your spirits, for therein are treasured the pearls of God's wisdom and concealed the beauty of God's essence. Whoso entereth and visiteth the land wherein is enshrined the Temple of God's Throne, it is as though he were seated at the right hand of God's majesty. And whoso standeth at the gate where gather the angels nigh unto God, while in his heart lurketh the slightest trace of desire, the breezes of God's spirit shall not waft over him. O people! Know ye your station, inasmuch as ye abide beneath the shade of the Tree of God's Paradise. Have mercy upon yourselves and depart not therefrom if ye be birds soaring in the heaven of God's oneness. Ye shall be tried with a blind and deaf test, but whoso keepeth his feet firm upon God's path, it is as though he walked in the precincts of God's sovereignty. This Dove shall warble in this atmosphere, and ye shall neither witness what ye have witnessed nor hear what ye have heard. Blessed are the eyes for what they have seen, and the ears for what they have heard, and the hands for what they have grasped. And whoso heareth not what ye have heard is deprived of God's melodies and deaf to the cooing of God's Dove. This is the final counsel of this servant in these words which have appeared through the grace of God's eternal dawn. Act upon them, O servants of God, that the essences of God's bounty may be perfected upon you. Say: O people! Sanctify your spirits and purify your hearts and empty your souls and turn not to anything nor let anything prevent you nor let this fleeting dominion veil you. Enter into the Egypt of God's love and dwell in the precincts of His mercy and find solace in His remembrance. Then turn away from aught else. Then drink from the oceans of His grace, then enter the sanctuary of His beauty, then burn away the veils of limitation that prevent you from His union and meeting, and delight in the everlasting, enduring blessings of life through His wondrous favors. Be not of those who feared not God and His loved ones, and who were not ashamed before the Manifestations of His Cause and the Daysprings of His glory, and who were of those who exceeded the bounds in His Cause and spread corruption in His wisdom and denied His signs and turned away from His beauty, and thereby departed from the party of the All-Merciful and entered the party of Satan, and were among the perishing ones. And I send blessings and peace upon the First Dawn that rose and shone forth, and upon the Last Dawn that illumined and revealed, and upon Him Whom God shall make manifest on the day of His advent from the canopies of light in a cloud of fire, and upon those who guided unto Him on the day of His manifestation and drew nigh unto Him on the day of meeting Him, that the lights of His essence may be perfected upon all who are in the heavens and earths. At that time I say: Praise be unto Him for He is the Lord of the worlds and the Beloved of the mystics. He.\n\nO My beloved and intimate friend! Since certain unseemly deeds have appeared from some which are contrary to the good-pleasure of God, therefore these few words concerning the elevation of the stations of spiritual conduct have been set forth, that the dwellers in this land may walk upon this straight path and shining way, so that no sorrow may find its way to anyone. And since Mirza Javad was setting forth to circumambulate the Kaaba of the All-Bountiful, these degrees of unity were expressed in this Tablet of wisdom, that all may be preserved from the hardships of the Cause and the intensity of self, and that the ships of hearts and minds may rest upon the Ararat of piety and acceptance. How excellent is the reward of those who recite, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My glorious mention to his honor Mulla Rajab-'Ali and Aqa 'Ali-Muhammad.

Thus hath the Tongue of Eternity spoken.\n\nI beseech the True One, glorified and mighty is He, that through His grace, mercy and favor He may transform the hearts of the peoples of the world through this most great elixir, and cure the chronic diseases of ignorance, heedlessness, weakness and doubt through this supreme remedy, that all may turn to the horizon of certitude and partake of the choice sealed wine. This essence of essences hath appeared from the mine of divine wisdom and is and ever shall be the Primal Word. Exalted, exalted be its sovereignty! Exalted, exalted be its power! Exalted, exalted be its dominion! Exalted, exalted be its influence! It is the elixir of triumph, the sign of oneness, and the cause of the world's healing from its diverse ailments. Exalted, exalted be its might! Exalted, exalted be its mention! Exalted, exalted be its manifestation! Exalted, exalted be its concealment!\n\nWhatever any perfect one might say in this station is imperfect. How can the poor and weak one speak of the Ocean of Wealth? How can the helpless and indigent describe the Sea of Power? We beseech God to illumine all through the lights of the Sun of Knowledge and to cause them to attain unto the sprinkling of the Ocean of Generosity. He is the Bestower, He is the Ordainer. I testify, and all things testify, to His sovereignty, His bounty, His grace and His generosity. Verily He is the Most Exalted, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nThereafter, your letter reached this servant and I found therein the fragrance of your love for the Beloved of the world and the Goal of the nations. When I read and understood it, I turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and presented its contents in the Most High and Resplendent Station. Thereupon the Tongue of the Beloved spoke: \"Verily We have mentioned him and do mention him, and We beseech God to strengthen him in that which will exalt His Cause and purify him from all that He abhorreth and sanctify him from whatsoever is unworthy of His days which were foretold in the Scriptures of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Give thanks unto God for having created thee, sustained thee, and guided thee to His straight path. Hold fast in all conditions to the hem of the robe of thy Lord's mercy and cleave unto the cord of His Most Great Name. Say: \\[...\\]\"\n\nO Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations and Beloved of the world! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name through which the ocean of Thy meeting surged and the fragrance of Thy raiment was diffused, to make me successful in Thy remembrance and praise, and to strengthen me in Thy service and obedience. O Lord! Deprive me not of the oceans of Thy bounty and the suns of Thy favors. I beseech Thee to ordain for me, through Thy Most Exalted Pen and Thy Will that dominates all things, that which will profit me in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapes that can be witnessed or seen, and verily Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. O my God and my Sovereign! Make me not to be debarred from the Euphrates of Thy wisdom nor deprived of the manifestations of Thy Kingdom. Thou hast ever been the Dominator over Thy servants and the Sovereign over those in Thy heaven and earth. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nBlessed art thou, and again blessed art thou, for having attained to the remembrance of the Beloved once more. Verily, He remembers him who remembers Him and hearkens unto the call of them that remember Him.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the Stone, this station has been mentioned in every tongue, whether Persian or Arabic. However, in one Tablet concerning Mariyah the Copt, this station is mentioned in detail. This evanescent servant, from the first day he attained this Cause and was occupied with transcription, has never heard the Beloved mention anything in this regard. However, some petitions from before and after have arrived from various directions inquiring about this matter. Therefore, in response to each one, as was befitting, drops from the ocean of knowledge were manifested, and whenever anyone wished to engage in this pursuit, they were forbidden and told that the time had not yet come - wait until God brings it in His time. For today all must be focused on another matter, which is the teaching of souls with wisdom and utterance, so that the copper of the existence of servants might be transformed into pure gold through the elixir of the divine Word and turn toward the supreme horizon. Today man is able to acquire eternal stations, and whatever is lost today can never be regained. God willing, you will be engaged in the remembrance of Truth with the utmost joy and delight. He is the Illuminator of hearts, the Companion of hearts, and the Master of hearts. Blessed is he who has drunk the Kawthar of recognition and was among the assured ones.\n\nIn truth, nothing can be clearer than what was mentioned in the Persian treatise; everything was explained in detail in that treatise.\n\nAs to what you wrote about returning water to the body, if there is a reduction in the repetition of water, what should be done - it was submitted, and They said: First, you must know that the intended water was the divine water, and that water is characterized by oiliness, for oiliness is concealed within it. For if the water were pure water, meaning plain water, it would never be capable of extracting the hidden oil in the earth which is called the gold of the sages and the essence of essences. Moreover, mixture is impossible, for the hidden oil in the earth has been called fire and red sulfur in one station, and there can be no mixture between oil, which is the essence of fire, and water. This matter is clear and evident to every discerning one. Anyone who becomes cognizant of the water, if there is reduction in the process and it diminishes, can take its equivalent. Thus does the Wronged One explain in His manifest prison.\n\nO Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been established upon the throne of power and strength and majesty, and will continue to be even as He hath been. There is none other God but Him, the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. It behooveth thee on this day to hold fast unto that which will cause thy mention to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Turn not thy gaze toward the world and its concerns. By My life! It shall perish, and grace will abide with him who hath forsaken it out of love for God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. When thou attainest unto this Tablet, render thanks unto God, then make mention of the Wronged One in accordance with what He hath taught thee of the straight Path of God. Know thou that God hath appointed a time for every matter, and verily it hath not come to pass, but when it doth come to pass it shall appear with truth. He, verily, is the True Informer, the Trustworthy. We have not given leave to anyone to occupy himself with this matter. To this testifieth My tongue and My pen and beyond them thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus have We made mention of thee and caused thee to hear, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be numbered with the patient ones. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00789 ===\n\n=== START BH00790 ===\n\nO honored servant, the Afnan, his honor Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, may consider this.\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nPraise, sanctified above the understanding of all created things, befitteth the One desired by all the worlds, Who hath ordained tribulation exclusively for His loved ones. Blessed are they who are nigh unto God - those souls who have ascended by the ladder of tribulation unto the most exalted heights. These are the loved ones of God, glorified be His majesty. They have ever fixed their gaze upon the most sublime horizon. Hardships did not prevent them from turning toward Him, nor did adversities hold them back from drawing nigh unto Him. Rather, the trials of the world and its afflictions served to feed the fire of love and increase its flame. Verily, whosoever becometh aware of the changeability, transformation and evanescence of the world, no earthly thing can wither his spirit or deprive him of joy and delight. His gladness is in God, and his pleasure is for God's sake. His intimate companion is \"We are God's\" and his close associate is \"and to Him shall we return.\" When the heart is illumined with the lights of divine knowledge and is filled with the remembrance, praise, love and affection of God, glorified be His majesty, no space remaineth therein for the sorrows of the world and the tribulations that descend upon it to enter or penetrate.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Light of the world, Illuminator of the world, Subduer of the world, and Dispeller of the sorrows of the nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, through which the breezes of the dawn of Thy grace have wafted over Thy servants, to assist Thy Afnan to attain unto Thy presence and to hold fast unto that which hath been ordained for them through Thy bounty and favors. Then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies and from the malice of those who have denied Thee and Thy signs. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, to open before their faces the doors of Thy grace, that the fragrances of Thy utterance may attract them to a station wherein the conditions of the world and its tribulations will not sadden them, nor will the deeds of those who have turned away from Thy most exalted horizon extinguish their ardor. Then enable them, O my God, in all circumstances, to draw nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nMy spirit is a sacrifice unto your remembrance and service! Two epistles from your honor arrived, one before and one after - each was a key to the cities of love, affection and attention. After reading and becoming apprised of their contents, I approached the Most Exalted Station and presented them before His face. His blessed and exalted Word states:\n\n\"O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Reflect upon the tribulations that have befallen the Self of God, and likewise what came to pass upon the Prophets. The divine love so overtook them that the afflictions and adversities of the world were regarded by them as a feast of delight and joy. The opposition of the world and the denial of the nations did not prevent them from turning toward God, nor did it deprive them of the greatest joy. Through the sweetness of the All-Merciful's utterance and what was ordained for them, they regarded the world as non-existent and null. At every moment, on wings of joy they would ascend to the heights which is the station of nearness and meeting. And if the worlds and their conditions were confined to this world, they would never have delivered themselves into the hands of their enemies. I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of this Prison - those Essences of being ever stood firm in the station of submission and contentment, to such degree that the tyranny and oppression of the people of the world did not deter them from steadfastness in the Cause. When the heart is connected to the Most Great Ocean, it beholdeth the world and all that the people possess as a shadow that will soon perish and pass away. Perchance what hath befallen you may become the cause for the manifestation of God's hidden and divine favors. You are related to Him, and what hath come upon you occurred after certitude and acceptance. May there appear through this that which will bring solace to the eyes and joy to the hearts. None is aware of the mysteries of consummate wisdom. This Wronged One beareth witness to this in this remote Prison.\"\n\nSay: \"My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and clinging to Thee. Thou seest the weakness of Thy loved ones and the strength of Thine enemies and their tyranny in Thy lands. I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen whereby Thou hast subdued all things, and by the influence of Thy greatest signs, to assist me in that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. O Lord! Thou seest me in the midst of sorrows. I beseech Thee to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will cause me to soar in Thy atmosphere, to be attracted by Thy verses, and to take refuge in Thy presence. O Lord! Ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will benefit me in every world of Thy worlds. I am the one, O my God, who hath acknowledged Thy unity and Thy oneness. Thy all-encompassing knowledge hath preceded me, and Thou knowest that which will exalt me and enable me to achieve what Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art the Possessor of the throne on high and of the earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nIn truth, the consequences of affairs are veiled from perception and vision. None but God, exalted be His glory, has been or is aware of them. Often it happens that from these sorrows, the gates of joy, delight, gladness and exultation are opened. Today there exists no station, no bounty, and no honor greater than what has been bestowed upon the Afnan. At one time this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of creation in this connection, blessed and exalted be His utterance: \"O servant present! Often does God, exalted be His glory, make that which is distant the cause of nearness, and many a sorrow He transforms into supreme joy, and how many a constriction He changes into expansion. The bounty is in His hand and within His mighty grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, night and day for that which will gladden and refresh the soul. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nRegarding the countenance of the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the Most Glorious of all Glory, the Greater Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory, was commanded to write that it should be given to the Greater Holy Mother, her mother, whether it be in that land or with whomsoever it may be. This matter was conveyed some time ago. I beseech God that He may aid souls to act in accordance with what hath been sent down from the heaven of His command.\n\nThe letter of Mulla Shafi', upon him be the Glory of God, which you forwarded, was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and an answer hath been revealed which will be sent subsequently. Likewise, one blessed Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for the Greater Holy Mother, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Praise be to God, they have been and are remembered at all times. Some time ago, harm was inflicted by an oppressive government, and each day some new tribulation and affliction became manifest and evident. God will change it through a command from His presence. Verily, He hath power over all things. The purpose is that his honor hath also shared in the sorrows with the Divine Lote-Tree.\n\nTo the honored Afnans of that land I convey greetings, praise and glory, and likewise to the friends of that land. I beseech God that He may illumine those regions with the light of the Afnan and manifest a new world. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Lord of the Throne and earth. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.\n\nThe Servant\n\n26th of Dhi'l-Hijjih 1304\n\n=== END BH00790 ===\n\n=== START BH00791 ===\n\nHe is the One Who Warbleth upon the Twigs!\n\nThis is a remembrance from Our presence unto them that remember. Verily it is the ornament of grace unto all who dwell in the world. Through it there springeth forth from hearts the sweet basil of love, proclaiming \"There is none other God but He, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\" By it faces became radiant and the heavens and earth were illumined. How many servants have found the sweetness of utterance and turned toward the All-Merciful, and how many remained heedless and were among the wayward!\n\nBehold then and remember the days of Moses when He came with the truth and called the people unto God, the Mighty, the Gracious. The people opposed Him, save those who drank the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the mercy of their Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. The divines rose against Him with rancor and hatred. Then did We preserve Him by a sovereignty from Our presence and delivered Him from the oppressors.\n\nThen We sent forth the Spirit and dispatched Him with a spirit from Our presence and a mercy from Our side, and He called the people unto this Great Name. He said: \"Verily He shall come with the truth and shall fulfill for you what ye possess.\" Thus was the matter decreed from the presence of One knowing, informed. He would hasten through the field of praise and remembrance, and proclaim the mystery of this Secret that hath appeared with the ornament of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThereupon necks were stretched forth in hypocrisy and they arose to extinguish that resplendent, luminous Light. There befell Him in My path what hath not befallen anyone before Him - verily We were aware. Then We sent forth after Him the Beloved with clear signs and manifest proofs, and He called the people by this ancient Remembrance. He bore hardships and tribulations in love of this Beauty that hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity. Then most of the people opposed Him and denied God, the Mighty, the Praised. Were it not for My protection and sovereignty, they would have slain Him on the very first day wherein He called the servants unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nThen We adorned the tablet of creation with the ornament of the Primal Point, Who gave the people glad tidings of this wondrous Cause. He began the Book with this Name and sealed it with this beauteous Remembrance. He said: \"Verily He shall manifest whatsoever He willeth, not what ye desire. He is indeed the Ruler over what He willeth. In all things He proclaimeth: 'There is none other God but I, the Single, the Unique, the All-Encompassing.' Behold Him with His eye, not with your eyes. Leave what ye possess in your quest for what He possesseth. This is better for you, if ye be of them that know.\n\n\"O people! A single word from Him cannot be equaled by what was revealed in the Bayan, nor will all the books of the world suffice you at His appearance. He shall manifest however He pleaseth, not as ye wish. His Will is hidden in the treasuries of knowledge and none hath comprehended it save His own knowing Self. O people! When He cometh and ye attain unto the lights of those days, turn ye unto Him with radiant faces and follow not every remote idolator. Beware lest the Bayan withhold you from your Lord, the All-Merciful. By God! Nothing shall profit you this Day, even if ye cling to every mighty pillar. This is a Day wherein light is transformed into fire and the Bird of the Divine Throne crieth out: 'This is a mighty Day!' This is a Cause the like of which hath not appeared in creation.\" Thus testified the Lord of Invention, Who came with the truth and dwelleth in this remote prison.\n\nBehold how the people of the Bayan read the Book and make mention of Him Whom We sent with the truth, yet oppose Him by Whom every mouldering bone was quickened. Behold these people - they are like those who passed before, nay more veiled. Blessed be they who perceive! Among them is he who cast aside his God, turning to his own desire. Lo! He hath not found the fragrance of the Bayan in the days of his Lord, the All-Merciful \\[...\\]\n\nHe would have been among the perishing ones if he had known to walk with his own eyes toward the Spring by which hearts were stirred and the eyes of those near to God were solaced. Thus do We recount unto you what hath befallen Us from those who denied the right of God and His proof when He came from the heaven of bounty with this Ancient Name. They behold the Sun yet deny it; they hear the most wondrous melodies of the All-Merciful, yet say \"Sufficient unto us are the imaginings of the idolaters.\" Say: If ye possess a proof greater than what hath been sent down in truth, or evidence mightier than what hath appeared in creation, bring it forth if ye be truthful. Power hath filled all regions, proof hath encompassed all in the realms of being, and evidence hath surrounded all creation, yet most people are as dead. Their ears are debarred from truly hearing, their tongues from mentioning the Lord of Names, and their eyes from turning to this resplendent horizon. The Beloved hath come, yet they know not; the Desired One hath appeared, yet they perceive not; the oceans of knowledge flow, while they hasten in the wilderness of ignorance, understanding not. The Kawthar of life hath circulated by the hands of the grace of their Lord, the All-Merciful, yet they turn away therefrom. The breezes of revelation have wafted, yet they sense them not. The countenance of Glory hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity, yet they see it not. The Hidden Book hath been recited, yet they hear it not. The table of the spirit hath been sent down, yet they remain far from it. Blessed is he who hath stretched forth the hand of power in the name of his Lord, the Chosen One, and thereby rent asunder the veils of those who hesitated in the Cause of God, the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Existing, and who hath spoken with such authority that the might of the wicked ones - who, when the Self-Subsisting came, followed mere fancy - could not prevent him. Were We to recount what We have suffered at the hands of the workers of iniquity, all things would lament and honored servants would cry out. We have accepted all afflictions in the path of God, and all calamities for the exaltation of His Word, the Mighty, the Beloved. In all times have We been slain by the swords of the losers. Say: The sword of hypocrisy is sharper than the sword of steel, were ye to know. My hair crieth out, and my neck asketh: \"Was I severed in the path of God?\" It answereth: \"Yea, by my Lord!\" but the people see not. We remember God in all conditions, and the veils of majesty prevent Us not - to this do near servants testify. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath called the people with supreme steadfastness to this Cause whereby hearts have been illumined. Woe unto him who hath been deprived of the fragrances of the verses and hath opposed Him at Whose call they that lay in the graves arose. Turn ye unto God, detached from all else, then remind the people in such wise that they who hesitate may hasten. Say: He asketh no recompense or reward from you, nor doth He command you save what is better for you than all that is hidden and manifest. Cast aside that which preventeth you from guidance; turn with pure hearts to the horizon of the revelation of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Those whom the winds of the love of their Lord, the All-Merciful, have not stirred - these are indeed a people confounded. Say: O people! Make good what hath escaped you in the days of God, and follow not every rejected learned one. Say: Knowledge is the recognition of My Self, turning unto My Face, standing firm in My Cause, and following what hath been sent down in the scrolls of My glory and the tablets of My grace, would ye but know. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Crown of all names, and through which earth and heaven were illumined, to cause me to be numbered with them who have quaffed the wine of Thy Revelation from the hands of Thy bounty, and who have stood firm in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the veils of human allusions could withhold them from Thy wondrous signs, nor the curtains of words could hinder them from turning unto the manifestations of Thy grace. O Lord! Number me, then, with them that are steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in their love for Thee. Moreover, ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones, whom Thou hast made the Daysprings of certitude in Thy land and the Dawning-Places of faith in Thy realm. Thou art He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy power.

O Mahdi! Thy letter hath arrived and We have heard its contents. We answer thee through this wondrous Epistle which crieth out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven, and summoneth all unto the All-Informed One. Blessed is he who hath heard and turned toward Him; woe unto them that turn away, who have followed the dawning-places of idle fancies. They are assuredly among the most lost in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou for having aimed for the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Summit, until thou didst stand before the Gate which was opened through the Most Great Name unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee and preserve thee in such wise that the affairs of creation shall not withhold thee from the Truth. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good. Grieve not at anything. In all matters place thy trust in Him Who hath strengthened thee and caused thee to recognize this mighty Cause. Remind My loved ones of My verses and give them the glad-tidings of My tender mercy and My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Munificent.\n\nSay: O people of God! Beware lest the affairs of men debar you from My Self-Subsisting Name, or the oppression of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment fill you with fear. We counsel you to observe patience and tranquility in all conditions, and that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen in My Perspicuous Book. And We make mention of Our loved ones that the remembrance may draw them to a station wherein neither the taunts of enemies nor the might of the heedless shall grieve them.\n\nO Ibrahim! Hear the call from the Uttermost Tree before the faces of all men: Verily there is none other God but He, the Possessor of the Throne and earth. Break the idols of vain imaginings with the power of Abraham, then aid thy Lord with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nO Sadiq! My Most Exalted Pen hath turned toward thee while the Wronged One was in the prison of His enemies, and mentioneth thee with that whereby the near ones perceive the fragrance of the garment, the unitarians perceive the fragrance of Beauty, and the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Fadlu'llah! The face of bounty hath turned toward thee and calleth thee to that which shall be a lamp unto thee in every world of the worlds of thy Lord. Cast aside what the people possess; take what thou art bidden by God with a strength that the might of the world cannot frustrate, and with a power that the hosts of the oppressors cannot prevent.\n\nO Sabbagh! The All-Bountiful maketh mention of thee from this station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of Names, and commandeth thee to observe trustworthiness, godliness, truthfulness and fidelity. Thus hath spoken the Lord of the worlds in His Most Great Prison, as a bounty from His presence upon thee. He is, verily, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nO Ahmad! When a crier cometh unto thee, leave him to himself and turn toward the Most Exalted Summit, the station wherein the atoms cry out: \"The kingdom and dominion, and the power and might belong unto God, the Lord of the mighty Throne!\"\n\nO Pen! Turn thy face toward him who hath been named Muhammad Isma'il. Say: The Ancient Countenance hath turned toward thee from the Most Exalted Horizon and desireth to make mention of thee with that which attracteth the hearts of the Concourse on High and the Most Exalted Paradise. When thou hearest and perceivest the fragrance of thy Lord's verses, arise and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, for having remembered me while I was among the polytheists.\"\n\nO Ali! We counsel thee to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped, the limbs of the jurisprudents have trembled, and the hearts of the names have been perturbed, save those whom thy Lord, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, hath willed.\n\nO Baha'ud-Din! Thy name hath been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We have remembered thee with verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of the world or the riches of nations. When thou attainest and findest the fragrance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful's utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! Thou hast borne tribulations for the exaltation of the Most Great Word and hast manifested that which was hidden in God's knowledge, the Lord of the exalted Throne.\n\nO Abdullah! Take hold of the Book with such strength that neither the foolish ones of the world nor the clamor of nations can deter thee. This is what was ordained in the Book, when it appeared all the books of the world bowed down before it. He Who possesseth the knowledge of all things from God, the Goal of the worlds, beareth witness to this.\n\nO Aqa Beg! This is the Day of steadfastness and faithfulness. Blessed is the servant who hath arisen to serve his Lord with such strength that neither ranks nor multitudes could hinder him. He arose and said: \"God is our Lord, the Lord of our fathers, and the Lord of this glorious and wondrous Day.\"\n\nO Baqir! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One from the Supreme Horizon calleth out with the most exalted call: \"O people! Fear God and follow not those who have taken their idle fancies as lords besides God. Turn with radiant faces and be not of the patient ones.\"\n\nO Asghar! The Lord of Destiny remembereth thee from the direction of His Most Great Scene, and counseleth thee with that which will elevate God's Cause among His servants and manifest man's station in the realm of possibility.

The polytheists turned away and objected to Him Who created them, fashioned them, manifested them, made them witness, and gave them utterance. Thus did their souls prompt them to that which caused the Concourse on High to lament, and the dwellers of Paradise and the inhabitants of this glorious station to weep.\n\nO Muhammad-Baqir! Blessed is he who hath attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen, recognized its station, and read what was revealed unto him from this quarter, whose light was sanctified above the sun and its effulgence, and above the moon and its radiance.

Blessed is he who heareth and seeth, and woe unto every heedless one who is debarred from this glorious station.\n\nO Abu-Talib! The Wronged One remembereth thee in His station and counseleth thee with such virtues that all who possess the sense of smell shall find from them the fragrance of My morals, and with such deeds that all who possess sight shall behold from them My shining and luminous light.\n\nO Ali! Blessed art thou and thy father who bore tribulations in God's path and heard the derision of enemies, the turning away of the wretched, and the objections of those who disbelieved when the Lord of Revelation and the Speaker of Sinai came - He Who was mentioned in the books of God, the Goal of the mystics.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of Mirza Aqa that the rapture of the call may seize him and draw him nigh unto the Supreme Summit - the station whereon the Ancient Beauty was established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, calling all unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nO Abdul-Husayn! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison's direction and counseleth thee with that which He counseled His loved ones aforetime when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra. Verily, He hath come from the heaven of grace for the reformation of the world and the salvation of nations. Every discerning mystic beareth witness to this.\n\nO Asadullah! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that which was a light to the horizons, a surge to the seas, a rustling to the trees, a spirit to bodies, a remembrance to the righteous, a treasure to the just, and a book for those who have forsaken the world, clinging to His firm cord.\n\nO My handmaidens who have believed in the All-Informed Single One! We make mention of you at the close of the Book. O My leaves! Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have hearkened unto the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven. Blessed is the maidservant who hath attained unto the lights of divine knowledge, who hath responded to her Lord, and who hath circled round His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. And blessed is the leaf that hath clung to the Tree in such wise that neither winds could shake her, nor the clamor of them that have denied God when He came from the Kingdom of eternity with a great sovereignty. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon the people of God who have not cast behind them His Covenant and His Testament, who have heard and responded - these, verily, are among those that are firmly established in a perspicuous Book.\n\n=== END BH00792 ===\n\n=== START BH00793 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!\n\nThis is a Book from Us to him who has shattered the idol of vain imaginings through the sovereignty of the remembrance of his Lord, the Lord of all men, and who has turned unto the Countenance in days wherein all names were overturned, save those whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, did will. Faces have turned black and souls have been perturbed when God came with the Kingdom of verses. One said: \"Why hath He come?\" Say: \"Despite thy will, O thou who art a polytheist and filled with doubt!\" Another said: \"Hath the appointed time come?\" Say: \"Yea, by Him Who sendeth down the rain! The appointed time is none other than His own Self, could ye but understand, O people of insight!\"\n\nAmong the polytheists is he who said: \"Will the All-Merciful come before the creation of the Bayan appeareth?\" Say: \"Behold with His eyes - He hath come from the heaven of Command with power and sovereignty. Can the veils of allusions prevent Him? Nay, by the Manifestor of clear evidences!\" Among them is he who said: \"That which was ordained in the Book hath not been fulfilled.\" Say: \"Through My manifestation all things are perfected. Reflect, O ye who are endued with insight! Were it not for My mention, the Bayan would not have been revealed, and were it not for My appearance, its creation would not have been completed, even were it to endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure.\" Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of God, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Through My confirmation is every matter established and all that hath been mentioned in the Tablets perfected.\n\nSay: Were We to abrogate what hath been ordained in the Bayan, none hath the right to say \"why\" or \"wherefore.\" Thus hath it been sent down in the Tablets from the presence of Him Who causeth the dawn to break. We have not abrogated the Bayan, but rather have been as the morning dew to that which was sown therein with justice. To this testifieth all things, and beyond them He Who knoweth both the hidden and the manifest. Through My manifestation the heaven of the Bayan was raised up and what was revealed therein was established. Those who have denied this are in heedlessness and error.\n\nBy My Self! I have rolled up the heaven of vain imaginings and the Sun of wisdom hath shone forth from the horizon of power. Every matter hath been made dependent upon My Word. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Bayan - read it, that ye may know Him by Whose light the horizons have been illumined. Say: Be fair, O people of the Bayan! Were it not for My manifestation, who would help the All-Merciful amidst all creation? Fear God, O ye by whose words the pillars of the Throne have been shaken and the clouds have wept. Through My arising hath the Sun of remembrance shone forth and the banners of unity been raised upon the hills.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nBe fair, O people of insight! Lo, the Last is the Most Manifest, and His countenance is the Most Great. He Who is established upon the throne with power and sovereignty doth testify to this. O people! Do ye dispute with Him Who, beneath the sword, calleth you unto God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling? Doth He seek from you any recompense? Nay, by the Lord of all names! Doth He seek any reward? Nay, by this Dayspring that hath dawned from the horizon of the Divine Will with sovereignty and power! Were He to find that which ye imagine, whence would He find life for Himself, after being between the fangs of wolves? By God! The Proof lamenteth My grief, and the eye of Evidence weepeth for My soul. The Most Exalted Pen hath at this moment shed blood, for the heart of Baha hath melted by reason of the fire kindled by them that have disbelieved in the Lord of Names. Woe unto them, and misery to every doubting polytheist!\n\nDoth it beseem to hesitate in this Cause, after the crimson Ark hath sailed upon the sea of names? Nay, by this Beauty through Whose Name the mountains have passed away! Say: Do ye deny Him through Whom all existence hath turned toward the direction of its Purpose, and through Whom the Luminary of the Cause hath shone forth from the horizon of the lands? The head of the Bayan hath been adorned with the crown of My remembrance, and its temple with the robe of My love, yet ye have stripped it bare, O people of the veils! Among them is he who saith \"I have believed in the Bayan.\" Say: Silence thy tongue, O thou denier and deceiver! The Bayan waileth by reason of thy deed, and with it wail the people of Paradise and the denizens of the holy sanctuaries at eventide and at dawn.\n\nIf thou didst believe in the Bayan, why didst thou draw the sword of renunciation against the Beloved of the All-Merciful, through Whom the All-Glorious smiled and through Whom the brocade of the Book of Creation was adorned? Verily, they that have turned away rejoice in their deeds; they walk while the wrath of God pursueth them. We testify that the Bayan is clear of them, and We are clear of them. Thus hath testified He Whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of lights.\n\nSay: Die in your wrath! The heaven of idle fancies hath been rolled up by the grasp of power and might. We have raised up the heaven of the Bayan with wisdom and clear proof, and We have adorned it with the star of Our wondrous Name, whereby all the tribes were seized with trembling, the idol wailed, and the pillars were shaken. Do they see for themselves any refuge? Say: There is no shelter for you this day from God. Whither can they flee, and to whom can they turn? Can they find anyone to protect them? Nay, by My life, they have no protector this day!\n\nO people! This is the Ancient of the heavens and earth. Ponder, that ye may recognize the decree of the Wondrous One. When ye have recognized it, ye shall know this Cause whereof ye were promised in the Tablets and Scriptures. Be united, O peoples of the earth! Through your unity the heaven of tyranny shall be cleft asunder and the idols shall fall. We have borne afflictions for your salvation. To this testifieth this Pen which God hath made the Sovereign of all pens.\n\nBlessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Throne, and for that which hath descended unto thee from the heaven of the Prison, whereby spirits are gladdened. Follow thy Lord in such wise that tribulation shall not prevent thee from remembering the Creator of heaven. Remember thy Lord at morn and eventide. Grieve not over the world and its conditions. That which is visible shall pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Supreme Protector, the Concealer.\n\nSay: O people of creation! This is the Day of Hearkening. Hearken unto the Call of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, which hath been raised between earth and heaven. By His Call the things have been attracted and faces have turned unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily, they that have been prevented - these shall have no portion in the kingdom. Soon shall they lament and shall find no refuge for themselves.\n\nTake thou the chalice of eternity in My Name, then drink it by My leave. Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, command thee. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned unto the Countenance with spirit and fragrance.\n\nAccording to the Most Holy Command, a copy of the missive has been sent. This evanescent servant conveys his salutations to your honor. Blessed art thou for that which hath flowed from thy pen in remembrance of thy Lord. This is what the Lord of Eternity informed me of when I was present before the Throne. Upon thee, O promulgator of God's Cause, rest the remembrance of God, His praise, and the praise of His near-serving ones. I beseech God that He may aid thy honor under all conditions.\n\n=== END BH00793 ===\n\n=== START BH00794 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One Friend, the One Goal, and the One Beloved!\n\nO fruits of the Divine Tree! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Creation from this wilderness. This is that same desert wherein the Voice of the Spirit was raised aloft and the sweet fragrances of the Beloved were diffused. In this wilderness most of the Prophets and Messengers responded with \"Here am I, O Lord, here am I,\" for they had heard and hearkened unto the Call that is raised today, and all beseeched from God the favor of attaining unto this most holy, most exalted Day. This is that land by whose rocks and clay they swore, inasmuch as it hath been honored by the footsteps of God and blessed by the fragrance of His garment. This is that place wherefrom the Interlocutor of Sinai did formerly proclaim \"Verily, I am God,\" and now too uttereth the same word, despite those who denied His signs and turned away from Him at Whose finger's motion the earth was cleft asunder and the heavens were rent, and at Whose will the Trumpet was sounded and all who are on earth swooned away, save those whom God, your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, did please to spare.\n\nHow greatly did the Son of 'Imran supplicate and implore in this wilderness, wherein is situated the Sinai of divine knowledge, that he might attain the presence of the All-Merciful, until at last he heard that which is recorded in detail in the Holy Books. Blessed is the land that hath today attained this supreme honor and been adorned with the lights of His Manifestation. Blessed is the spot that hath become the seat of His Throne and the place of His footstool. This is a station wherein every person of true spiritual sense can detect the fragrance of the All-Merciful, and every possessor of insight can behold His most exalted horizon.\n\nBlessed are ye, O fruits of the Tree of Existence, inasmuch as ye have attained unto My days, heard My call, and been honored by My verses, wherewith ye were promised in the Books of old by God, the Lord of the worlds. We counsel you to perform goodly deeds. By God! Through them is the Cause of God exalted amongst His servants and the banner of justice raised throughout His lands. Hold fast unto that which God hath taught you in His Book, and cleave unto that which shall profit you in all the worlds of His creation. He is the One through Whom the sun of grace hath shone forth from the horizon of creation and the ocean of bounty hath appeared in the kingdom of existence. Thus hath the Pen spoken from this most exalted station, from God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. Blessed is he who hath heard and recognized, and woe unto the heedless!\n\nGod willing, ye should occupy yourselves with the mention of the Lord of Creation in perfect fellowship and unity. We beseech God to gather all beneath the pavilion of oneness. Every matter dependeth upon means - thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Powerful, the Almighty. Observe in man that he hath been created with two hands, two feet, two eyes, and two ears, and through these means the Causer of Causes hath manifested that which is evident to every person of insight. Should any division occur in this assemblage of elements, man would remain without effect or fruit. Those souls who have drunk from the living waters and are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful must arise with perfect unity and wisdom. The sun of power shineth forth from the horizon of accord, and the moon of might appeareth from the heaven of unity. Strive that ye may find and act upon that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. Beware lest the affairs of men and their intimations sadden you \\[...\\]\n\nTheir clamor and deeds shall in no wise be equal to even a single letter of the Book, whether manifest or hidden. Every soul who today attaineth unto the remembrance of God is accounted among the people of Baha. Thus have We made mention of you that your stations and conditions may be exalted. Be grateful unto God for this supreme bounty.\n\nO people of Kaf and Ra! Purify your ears that ye may hearken unto My most sweet call. By My life! Whoso succeedeth in hearing it, neither shall the conditions of the world prevent him, nor shall the oppression of the nations sadden him. He shall arise to promote the Cause and shall speak with wisdom and utterance amidst the concourse of existence. Thus doth your Lord, the All-Merciful, command you - He Who hath taken unto Himself neither partner nor peer. Read ye My verses, traverse the realms of My knowledge, and hold fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness. Then act ye in accordance with that which We have enjoined upon you in the Book sent down from the heaven of Command. Beware lest ye differ in the Cause of God. Fear God and follow not every false one who hath been deprived of the ocean of truth. How many a learned one hath been veiled by his learning, how many a wealthy one hath been hindered by his riches, and how many an illiterate one hath turned unto the Countenance and believed in Him Who came from the heaven of Command with an authority that encompassed all worlds. By God! This is not the day to tarry. The Most Great Vision hath appeared, wherein speaketh the Lord of Destiny. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained unto the Call, and woe betide every heedless one who remaineth far from the ocean of nearness. Hold fast unto that which shall exalt your stations among the servants and this Command which hath been recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Mother Book.\n\nGod willing, ye should all arise to serve the Cause of God with the utmost wisdom and endeavor, in such wise that the opposition of them who dwell on earth shall not deter you. Most mighty is the Cause and most great is the Day. This is that Day which in most of the Books hath been designated as the Day of God, and this is that Day wherein, as He hath declared, Truth shall be made manifest and the ranks of angels shall stand ready to serve. No one hath been or shall ever be capable of befittingly describing this blessed Day. Strive ye that in these days of God pure and holy deeds may be made manifest from you. The promoter of the Cause today is goodly deeds. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and act in accordance with that which He uttereth and commandeth for the sake of God. Reflect upon the world's differences and the graves therein and the souls that repose therein. Where are their riches, their sciences, their arts, their strongholds, their treasuries, their hosts, their ranks, their pride, their palaces, their might and their power? They have returned to dust with great loss, save he who ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion through the love of God, the Lord of Names. By the life of God! He verily is in a noble station.\n\nAnd at the end of the Tablet We make mention of My handmaidens who have believed in the One, the All-Informed. How many a servant hath been kept back through pride from the Lord of Revelation, and how many a handmaiden hath turned unto the Much-frequented Fane and believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. He giveth whom He willeth whatsoever He desireth. He, verily, is the Single One, the One Alone, the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained unto My days, and turned unto My horizon, and clung to My luminous hem. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that none hath ever been able, nor shall ever be able, to reckon what God hath ordained for one believing man and one believing woman. Today, various darksome and corrupt veils have withheld the people from the Lord of all beings, and were the veil to be lifted even less than the eye of a needle, all would cry out \"O our grief for what we neglected towards God and His days!\" The day shall come when that which is now hidden shall be made manifest. Ere long shall the sincere ones, and the devoted ones, and the remembering women, and the devout women behold what hath been ordained for them in the Book that hath spoken with truth between the heavens and the earth, and summoned all unto the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Lord of this mighty Day.\n\n=== END BH00794 ===\n\n=== START BH00795 ===\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness:\n\nO My physician! We have loved thee and made mention of thee in divers Tablets. Verily thy Lord is with such of His servants as have turned unto Him and have detached themselves from all else. He is the Protector of them that have turned unto Him. Through thy gratitude to thy Lord the ocean of grace surgeth and mentioneth thee with this glorious mention. Grieve thou not over anything, but place thy trust in God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. By My life! There hath been sent down for thee in the Tablets that which nothing in all creation can equal. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Glorify the praise of thy Lord, then praise Him at morn and eventide.\n\nSay: My soul be a sacrifice for Thine exile, O Root of Glory and Tree of the Uttermost End and Source of all good amongst the people of creation! My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy imprisonment, O Thou Who hast sacrificed Thyself for the Cause of God, the Lord of all names! By Thy glory, O Beloved of the worlds and Desire of them that have recognized Thee! I love naught but Thy remembrance, desire naught but Thy good-pleasure, and turn to none save Thy luminous countenance. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for them who have tasted the sweetness of utterance from the mouth of Thy Will and who have circled round Thy Cause until they were martyred in Thy path. O Lord! Thou art the Generous One - all atoms testify to Thy generosity. Thou art the Merciful One - Thy mercy hath preceded all created things, and in the grasp of Thy Will is the control of all existence. Thou seest me burning with the fire of separation and aflame with the heat of longing. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Covenant was manifested on the Day of Separation and which Thou didst manifest in human form, and concerning which Thou didst question those who clung to it, by Thy power that dominateth the world, to make me in all conditions one who gazeth upon Thy countenance, is certain of Thy Cause, standeth in Thy service, sitteth in Thy love, is adorned with the ornament of Thy grace, uttereth the remembrance of Thy days and what befell Thy Beauty at the hands of the oppressors. O my Lord! O my Lord! O my Lord! Thou art He before Whose sovereignty and power all things bow down, and before Whose grandeur and majesty all necks are humbled. I beseech Thee by the water that hath flowed from the wellsprings of Thy Will and which Thou hast made the cause of life for Thy creation, to raise me to such a station that nothing shall prevent me from that which draweth hearts and minds to the court of Thy mercy and Thy favors. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Dominant, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAs to what was mentioned concerning the handmaidens of God, you must certainly exert your utmost effort and endeavor in managing the affairs of the loved ones of God. Some of the friends of God are somewhat saddened due to the apparent dispersion of means. Say: Be not grieved, but trust in God in all matters. Verily He is with you and hath ordained for you greater things than what you desired or desire. They should not be saddened in any way by the separation of outward things. They have never been and will never be forgotten. Some matters depend upon means and are dealt with accordingly, and if there be delay, they should not be disheartened. What is beloved is that they should be grateful and content with what hath been and will be manifested.\n\nConcerning Heydar-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, We have indeed accepted him through Our grace and clothed him in the garment of bounty and favor whereby all Paradise was illumined. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. However, this station was sealed with him, and whosoever shall commit after him what he committed, God will not make mention of him. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Such matters have in truth never been and are not pleasing. Likewise, a limited number in the past sacrificed their lives by their own hands in the path of the Beloved of all possibility, and the station of each hath been revealed in the Tablets. Blessed be the King of Martyrs who sacrificed his life in Iraq and his likes in other lands. O physician! There hath appeared in this Revelation that which hath not appeared before. Verily thy Lord is the Attractive, the Moving, the Penetrating, the Powerful, the Pulsating, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. However, after the martyrdom of the Pride of Martyrs, who was named Badi' in the Kingdom of Names, all are commanded to preserve their lives that perchance some service to the Cause of God might be rendered by souls. This is what We have desired for them. No one should transgress the bounds set by his Lord. Inform the people of what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in this regard that they may know and be of those who act.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned concerning Muhammad-Qabli-Rida, say: Turn toward the Most Great Scene. We have accepted what thou didst desire for him and have confirmed it. Be thou grateful and of those who give thanks. However, since prohibition hath preceded and this was truly in the interest of the people - for this land is much disturbed and travelers pass through from every direction, and despite the greatest prohibition they arrive every day - yet this hath not been and is not pleasing, for the harm of these matters affects the root of the Tree. Nevertheless, in view of the favor shown to Rida and through thy intercession, We have sought another matter that his heart may rejoice through the fragrances of these precincts wherein the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafteth over all who dwell in the realm of possibility.\n\nConcerning children, let them not grieve at all, for whosoever hath turned to God, God hath been and shall be his heir. Children are in truth for the remembrance of good, and what remembrance of good can surpass the mention of God? Every mention that hath been made of him in the Tablets is equivalent to a thousand righteous offspring who might have spent their lives and wealth in the path of God. Say: Be grateful, O My loved ones, for this bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds! O physician! The servant present before the Countenance hath in these days been afflicted with headache to such extent as to be somewhat prevented from writing, such that last night when a Tablet was revealed concerning thee, he later reported that much had been dropped from the pen and omitted. We have therefore repeated and revealed this Tablet in brief. Be thou grateful and say: Thine is the grace, O my Lord, the Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nO servant, 'Abdu'r-Rahim! Hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful from the Dawning-Place of sorrows in this Prison of contingent being. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou for having turned thy face toward the Countenance whilst it was in the hands of the oppressors. Grieve not that thou wert prevented from entering; verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hatred hath appeared in that land - this is that whereof We had informed Our servants aforetime. With Him is the knowledge of all things preserved in a guarding Tablet. Were anyone to behold Me with the eye of insight, he would see each member of My body in the mouth of a serpent. Soon shall that which hath been concealed and treasured be made manifest. Verily, thy Lord is He Who unveileth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be thou thankful that thou hast been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen, and that the face of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Great, hath been turned toward thee. Verily, he who hath ascended unto God is of those who have drawn nigh. We have accepted him as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bountiful. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh unto the sepulchre and hath said: \"Upon thee be greetings, O thou who hast turned toward God, the Remembrance of God and His praise! I testify that thou didst turn unto the Intended One and didst hasten unto God until thou didst reach the resting-place of those who bore tribulations in the path of God, the Lord of all names, and didst sacrifice thyself therein for the love of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. I testify that thou art of those who, when they heard the call, responded to their Lord and fulfilled His Covenant and His Testament on a day wherein the foundations of the doubters were shaken. Upon thee be the mercy of God and His grace, and the sweet fragrances of God and His spirit, O thou stranger and exile!\"\n\n=== END BH00795 ===\n\n=== START BH00796 ===\n\nTHE MOST HOLY, THE MOST EXALTED\n\nPraise be to God! Through the effulgent rays of the Most Great Luminary the horizon of the world is illumined and resplendent, and the outpourings of divine grace are streaming down and descending from the heaven of mercy and bounty. Blessed are they who through the promptings of malicious souls have not been debarred from the shores of the sea of oneness, and who through the favors of the Lord of creation have rent asunder the veils of idle fancy. These are they who have taken the wine of mercy from the hands of grace without hesitation and have quaffed thereof. Theirs is a goodly habitation.\n\nO ye who soar in the atmosphere of the All-Merciful and who circle round the Kaaba of divine knowledge! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One Who, in the midst of intense tribulation and affliction, hath not forgotten you and at all times enjoineth upon the loved ones of the All-Merciful that which is best for them, transcending all that hath been created in the heavens and on earth. The greatest of all things is steadfastness and unity around God's all-embracing Word. God willing, through divine grace and heavenly bounty, may ye all attain unto this. It is clearly evident that whatsoever is mentioned herein hath as its purpose the deliverance of souls from the prison of self and passion and their advancement unto the Most Exalted Horizon. All must hold fast unto the cord of steadfastness and cling to the hem of unity and concord. They must be so firm in the Cause that the fragrance thereof may guide aright those who are unsettled and wavering. This is not difficult for God to achieve.\n\nIf ye see Jim, say to him: \"By what proof didst thou accept and by what evidence didst thou turn away from God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Wise? Verily thou hast followed the desires of one who knoweth not his right hand from his left - he is assuredly among the most lost. And he who led thee astray - We have seized him for his transgression. Now in the sea of fire he saith: 'I repent unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds!' The hand of power hath struck his mouth and it was said: 'Be silent, O thou remote polytheist! Thou didst call the people unto one whom thou hadst neither seen nor known nor had any knowledge of his cause, and thou thyself dost testify to this, wert thou to be fair.' O servant! Have mercy upon thyself and upon the people, and follow not those who follow vain imaginings and have taken these as lords besides God. Cast away what they possess, then stand with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven. Thus doth the Lord of Names command thee, wert thou of them that comprehend.\"\n\nSpeak in the Persian tongue, that perchance he may comprehend the counselling words of the Lord and return to the shore of the Most Great Ocean. Strange it is that after the wondrous and exalted waves of the seas of divine favors and the effulgences of the words of the Lord, they are seen to be deprived and kept back from the shore of the sea of oneness by ancient allusions to the worn-out and obsolete notion of succession and the like. Say: God knoweth what is in your hearts and that which ye utter and speak. In these spiritual days all must attain unto the new divine adornment, sanctified from all that is in the hands of men and from all that they have heard, let alone the false succession which hath appeared from the direction of the liars. Such mentions have been veils of glory which most of humanity have been powerless to rend, yet God hath servants who, through divine power, have rent them all asunder and joined their Beloved. Today the people of God are those souls who regard all in the heavens and earth as dependent upon God's will, to such extent that were He to desire, by the movement of the Finger of His Will, He could raise a speck of dust to the loftiest heights of creation, and likewise return the highest summit to the lowliest particle. All that He saith is truth and all that He decreeth behooveth to be the beloved of them that know. Wondrous in all respects hath this Revelation appeared, were men to ponder thereon.\n\nIn brief, certain people of the Bayan have, through the utterances of the widows of the people of the Furqan, forbidden men from the Law of the All-Merciful. Say unto him of the letter Jim and his like: Observe with the eye of insight how for a thousand years or more all the Twelver sects assigned a specific place in imaginary cities for an imaginary being who never existed, along with imaginary wives and children, and they prostrated themselves before him. And if anyone denied him they would issue a decree for his death. Lo! They are recorded as worshippers of vain imaginings in the Book of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And after the birth of the Point in a known land, it became clear to them that possess insight that all that was in the hands of that people was false and meaningless. Similarly observe all the beliefs held by that people. I do not wish to rend certain veils. Blessed is the strong one who rendeth with the fingers of certitude that he may behold what is intended by his Lord, the Possessor of existence. All are commanded in this Revelation to observe the Revelation itself and its verses in complete sanctification from all else. This bounty hath been specific to this Revelation. And likewise He saith: When He appeareth He changeth light into darkness and darkness into light. Despite this, by your own self, since ye are unaware of His beginning and end, ye remain deprived of the Dawning-Place of the lights of oneness and the Dayspring of divine verses. Say: Consider for a moment the Persian Bayan, that perchance ye may abandon vain imaginings and behold the Sun of the name of your Lord, the Self-Subsisting, shining between the heavens and the earths. Hearken unto the voice of the faithful counsellor and, putting aside all that ye have heard, observe the divine verses and ponder upon that which hath appeared in the Revelation, that perchance ye may abandon selfish desire and turn unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. If ye and all on earth deny, verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.\n\nO My loved ones in Qaf! Leave these people, then turn with your hearts toward the court of God, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Be ye of such character that through you the horizons will be illumined and faces will be turned toward the court of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Give thanks unto God that your names have flowed from the Pen of Revelation and that the tongue of the Prisoner makes mention of you. We beseech God to aid you to be united in the Cause of your Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment, and to make you among those who have no fear and who shall not grieve. Drink ye the cup of life with spirit and fragrance, in spite of those who have denied the All-Merciful and who have turned away from His presence. Blessed are ye for having been mentioned by the Lord of Eternity in the Most Great Prison, and for having been the object of the gaze of God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal.\n\nStand ye firm in the Cause of God in such wise that every wavering one may become steadfast and every mouldering bone may be set in motion. Strive ye that the darkness of contingent being may be illumined by the lights of the mention of the All-Merciful. God willing, may ye all arise to that which befits your stations and your relationship to God. The Divine Lote Tree speaks - hearken ye with the ear of the soul. The tongue of the All-Merciful is uttering - attain ye unto its hearing. Thus doth your Lord, the All-Speaking, the All-Knowing, remind you.\n\nO My handmaidens in that land! Rejoice that ye have been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen, then remain steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of Names. Thus doth your Lord counsel you in this Tablet which hath been adorned with the ornament of the utterance of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. O handmaidens of Mine! God willing, drink ye forever and always from the Kawthar of the love of the Self-Sufficient, the Ever-Abiding, and be ye engaged in His mention and praise. Verily, the glory be upon you, O loved ones of God, and upon those who hearken to your words concerning this most wondrous and mighty Cause.\n\n=== END BH00796 ===\n\n=== START BH00801 ===\n\nHe is God--exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful\n\nPraise be to God Who is one in His power and peerless in His might and grandeur, He to Whose loftiness and sovereignty all things bear witness, and to Whose transcendence and dominion the Supreme Pen testifies. He hath ever been sanctified beyond the description of all who would describe Him and the mention of all who would make mention of Him, and will forever remain as He hath always been. There is none other God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Blessings, peace, salutations and praise be upon the Manifestations of His Cause, the Dawning-Places of His Revelation, the Daysprings of His wisdom and the Daybreaks of His knowledge--they who have forsaken the world and taken hold of that which they were bidden by God, the Lord of eternity and Creator of nations. These are God's ambassadors and His chosen ones, His trustees and His loved ones. Whoso hath recognized them hath recognized God, and whoso hath turned towards them hath turned towards God. They have no will, nor judgment, nor movement, nor rest, nor mention save by God's leave and through His might and power. And I invoke blessings and peace upon Him Who came with the truth, with a Book named the Furqan, whereby God distinguished between His servants and guided all unto His path, giving the near ones to drink from the cup of His bounty, the sincere ones from the ocean of His knowledge, and the pure in heart from the fountain of His presence. He it is Who was named by the most excellent names in the Book of Names, and by Muhammad in the kingdom of creation. Exalted be God, the Creator of the heavens, Who sent Him forth and adorned Him with the ornament of finality. He, verily, is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. The clamor of all who dwell on earth shall not deter Him from that which He desireth. He doeth what He pleaseth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAnd afterwards, the letter of that honored one reached this Wronged One in the Most Great Prison, and whatsoever was mentioned therein was observed. It became evident that you have inhaled a fragrance from the true rose-garden and have been illumined by a ray from the Spiritual Sun. We beseech God, exalted and glorified be He, to cause you to be wholly turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Reflect upon the centuries and ages past and consider what caused Noah to lament, and what was the reason for the affliction of all the Prophets and Messengers. Fix your gaze upon this blessed verse which hath descended from the heaven of the Divine Unity and ponder it. His word, exalted and glorified be He: \"O the misery of men! No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to scorn.\"\n\nHath there ever been a time when a light shone forth from the Dayspring of God's Cause and the people of the earth did not strive to extinguish it? And hath there ever been an instance when a word was manifested from the Dayspring of Revelation and the people of that age, whether learned or ignorant, did not deny it? With detached heart and illumined vision, ponder that which hath been mentioned and observe it. Call to mind the tribulations of the Seal of the Prophets and reflect upon their cause and reason. Although His Holiness - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - had come for the reformation of the world, all the divines of the idols and the Jews pronounced Him corrupt and issued the verdict for His death. And before Him, reflect upon Christ - who found not a place to rest His head any day, and all the people of that land rose up against Him save a few who were fishermen.\n\nBlessed is the one who speaketh with equity and pondereth the divine Books with fairness. In one place He saith, exalted and glorified be His word: \"Aforetime they did invoke for victory over those without Faith - when there came to them that which they recognized, they refused to believe in it: but the curse of God is on those without Faith.\"\n\nBy the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of divine knowledge! If that honored one were to comprehend the mysteries and allusions of this one blessed verse alone, it would suffice him - nay, all the peoples of the earth. God willing, may you drink from the ocean of knowledge through the grace of the All-Merciful and remain not deprived of the drops from the cloud of divine bounty. That which is visible today shall soon perish and vanish, and all bear witness to this word, for all have seen and continue to see this. Where are the Caesars and the sons of Caesars? Where are the Khosroes and the sons of Khosroes? Where are the Pharaohs and the sons of Pharaohs? Where are the tyrants and the sons of tyrants?\n\nReflect upon the Pharaohs of that land and their majesty and glory. How many souls were occupied with their protection, yet at the time of death and its arrival, none could prevent it. Where are the adorned palaces? Where are the embroidered couches? And where are those marshalled armies and those beautiful countenances? All, together with what they possessed, returned to dust with great remorse. Strive thou, through divine grace, to attain a station that shall endure as long as the Kingdom of God and His dominion shall last.\n\nSay: O God of Hosts, Lord of all being, Sustainer of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the sweet savors of Thy verses and the fragrances of the words of Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Dayspring of Thy names, to aid me in recognizing the Manifestation of Thyself. O my Lord! I am the poor one who hath hastened to the shore of the ocean of Thy riches. I ask Thee by Thy greatness and \\[...\\]\n\nI beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty not to shut me out from the gate of Thy bounty, nor to deprive me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. O Lord! I am the ailing one who hath turned toward the ocean of Thy forgiveness and healing. Deal with me according to what beseemeth Thy generosity, Thy sovereignty, Thy grace and Thy beneficence. My tongue, my limbs and my veins bear witness to Thy power, Thy might, Thy grandeur and Thy majesty. Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in this world and the next. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe beseech God to assist that soul in the recitation of this prayer that he may taste the sweetness of the mention of God. Verily He is the Bestower, the Bountiful.\n\nAs to the claims about which you wrote, it is most clear and evident that whosoever is able to discharge a debt and yet neglecteth to do so hath acted contrary to God's good-pleasure. Those who are in debt must strive with the utmost diligence to settle it. The binding command of God concerning trustworthiness, honesty, and rights is clear and manifest in all the Books, Tablets, Scriptures and Holy Writings. Blessed is he whom the vanishing ornaments have not kept back from the everlasting adornment, and whom greed and negligence have not deprived of the light of the sun of trustworthiness. However, all these matters are contingent upon ability, for the claim is dependent upon ability; the former is not permissible except after the establishment of the latter. \"Then let there be respite until ease cometh\" beareth witness to this utterance. However, that soul should rest assured in God's bounty. God willing, the gate of divine favor shall be opened. Verily the Cause is in God's hands. He giveth whatsoever He willeth to whomsoever He willeth. He is the Generous, the Bestower, the Merciful. Hath any thirsty one ever returned disappointed from the stream of the All-Merciful's mercy? And hath any true seeker ever been debarred from the wine of His bounty? Nay, by His very Self! We beseech God that all may attain with true thirst and drink from the Kawthar of His knowledge. Verily He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And peace be upon him who followeth the Command of God and attaineth unto the Salsabil of Divine Unity.\n\n=== END BH00801 ===\n\n=== START BH00802 ===\n\nHe is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth by His all-compelling dominion that encompasseth the horizons!\n\nO Imam! There hath come before the Throne a letter wherein was thy mention. We have, therefore, adorned thee with this remembrance which hath proceeded from the mouth of thy Lord, that thou mayest glory therein amidst the heavens and earths. How sweet is this fragrance that hath wafted from the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, throughout all creation! Blessed is he who hath perceived it and is of them that advance.\n\nO Imam! Arise with such steadfastness as cannot be altered by the doubts of men or the might of rulers. Thus doth thy Lord, the All-Knowing, command thee. Say: O thou remote oppressor! Hearest thou not how the Trump proclaimeth this Revelation and the Bell ringeth out this Most Great Name? The Most Exalted Pen hath been sounded, and all in creation were thunderstruck save whom thy Lord, the Lord of Names, did will. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nThe branches of denial have been broken and the tail of Satan severed by the sword of the All-Merciful. Thus was raised the clamor of them that disbelieved, and the pillars of every heedless remote one were shaken. When the fire of malice was kindled, We closed the door for known months. Then did God raise up those whom He destroyed by His pure might. He is verily the Protector over His servants. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. Should God wish, We would detail what hath transpired and send it unto thee. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus have We adorned thy temple with the raiment of remembrance and sprinkled upon thee from the ocean of thy Lord's mercy, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nO thou who art rich! Hearken unto the call from the direction of the Lord of Names, from the Most Exalted Tree. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. The people of blindness rose against Us with swords of rejection. When opposition reached its height, the Tongue of Unity spoke, after the door was closed and the veil drawn, saying - and His word is the truth: \"The necks have grown long with hypocrisy. Where are Thy swords of vengeance, O Destroyer of the worlds?\" Then did God raise up a people possessed of mighty strength who arose to aid the Cause with force and power. Thus did the hosts of oppression encompass Us, and there befell Us that which the pens are powerless to recount. Yet in such condition We continue to summon all beings unto God, the Lord of all men. Nothing shall prevent Us from the remembrance of God, even as the tyranny of every doubting oppressor did not prevent Us. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then make mention of it among the servants, that perchance they who sleep upon the couch of heedlessness and ignorance may become aware and turn unto the Lord of all mankind.\n\nO Shafi'! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having turned toward thee the face of God from this noble prospect. Blessed are ye for having heard the call and turned unto God, the Lord of the worlds. He that is moved by the fragrance of reunion and drawn by the lights of beauty is assuredly among the people of Baha, inscribed in a mighty tablet. Say: The Sun of the Promised One hath dawned. By God! He is verily the Desired One. Blessed is he who hath advanced with his heart and drunk of this luminous nectar. Be thou in such wise that neither the winds of trials move thee nor the veils of the oppressors hinder thee. Arise from the horizon of certitude with radiant countenance and gladdened eyes, speaking this Most Great Name. We have created you for the service of the Cause and exalted you through this manifest grace. God shall soon manifest your glory throughout the lands. He is verily the Ruler over what He willeth by His all-compelling sovereignty over the worlds.\n\nO Fath'u'llah! We have opened unto thee the gate of remembrance from this far-distant place, and the Tongue of Eternity makes mention of thee from the Most Great Prison. By My life! If thou wert to taste the sweetness of this bounty, thou wouldst detach thyself from all else and arise to serve thy glorious Lord. Thy name hath been mentioned before the Countenance, and there have been revealed for thee these verses which nothing created on earth can equal. Blessed is he who hears and says: \"Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!\" The Wronged One calls the people to God while they have drawn the swords of opposition against His radiant and wondrous face. Say: God is the protector of all things; He guards whomsoever He willeth through His sovereignty. When protection comes from His presence, the swords of the world cannot harm him. Thus have We caused to shine upon thee from the horizon of grace the sun of remembrance and utterance. When thou art illumined by its lights, render thanks and be of those who praise.\n\nO 'Ayn! Know thou that the eye is the highest of the senses, and its station is that of fire among the four elements. Therefore, it behooveth thee to manifest through the fire of thy Lord's love in such wise that the hearts of the righteous may be set ablaze through thee. Thy name was inscribed in the Book which was presented before the Throne, and We have revealed verses for thee and sent them to thee that thou mayest be assured of His bounty toward thee and be of those who have attained to the mention of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed art thou, O 'Ayn, for the eye of God hath turned toward thee from this Scene which God hath made the Qiblih of all who are in earth and heaven. Be thou as a bird soaring in My atmosphere, speaking My Name, celebrating My remembrance, and steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. The Lord of all beings hath been afflicted in the land of Syria amidst the people of darkness by what the hands of those who turned away from the countenance of Beauty have wrought. Be thou not grieved by what hath befallen Us. Be thou vocal with this Name amongst the servants.\n\nO Sharif! Hearken unto the call from this luminous Station from whose horizon the Book of Union was manifestly witnessed through grace. Blessed is he to whom the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned from this Most Great Prison, and by whose name moved the Pen that was held between the fingers of the All-Merciful.\n\nO My loved ones! Be not saddened by the barking of dogs. Hold fast to the cord of grace in this Day wherein that which was hidden from time immemorial hath been manifested. Take up the chalices in the name of the Cleaver of Dawn, then drink therefrom the choice wine of salvation, despite those who denied the proof when the All-Merciful came with an all-encompassing sovereignty. Beware lest the veils of the wicked prevent you from your Chosen Lord. Be steadfast in the Cause; thus hath the decree been irrevocably fixed by the truth.\n\nO Pen of loving-kindness! Turn toward Javad and make mention of him from the presence of the Lord of creation, Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with the sovereignty of God, the Self-Subsisting, that the fragrance of verses from the Lord of attributes might stir him and establish him in the love of God in such wise that neither the allusions of the deniers nor the signs of those who have turned away from God, the Mighty, the Beloved, can hinder him. Hold fast to the handle of sanctity and be a sign of detachment among the people. Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, command thee. Say: Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all else and followed what hath been revealed in the Tablets. He is truly the apple of the eye of existence. Make mention of your Lord, the All-Merciful, with wisdom and utterance. God will soon assist you with authority from His presence and will exalt whomsoever He willeth among His creation. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. All things are within the grasp of His power; neither is anything in the unseen or visible realms hidden from His knowledge.\n\nO Imam! Glorify on behalf of thy Lord those who have heard, have turned towards Him and have answered the Call of God when it was raised in truth from this exalted station. The name of not one of those who have turned unto Him hath been left out of thy Lord's Book. He, verily, is the One Whose grace is manifest. Remember them at all times, that they may be drawn by this wise Remembrance. Say: Sorrow not over anything, for He is with you and this sufficeth you, did ye but know. Rejoice in My remembrance of you and in My turning towards you from this Spot which God hath made the Source of His mighty and wondrous Cause. Thus hath the Divine Lote-Tree spoken forth from this most sublime Station, out of Its love for you, that ye may give thanks unto your Lord, the Most Merciful, at all times, and arise to aid His Cause amidst His heedless servants. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee amongst the loved ones of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00802 ===\n\n=== START BH00803 ===\n\nThis, which reacheth unto Fath-i-A'zam in the Land of Alif, that he may be of them that know.\n\nHe is the Ever-Abiding\n\nO Fath-i-A'zam! We have discerned in thee the victory of Our own Self, the Truth, and breathed into thee a spirit of power and might at the time when thou didst present thyself before the Throne in Iraq--and God is witness to this. By My Beauty! If thou shouldst desire, through the power We have conferred upon thee, to turn the world to the countenance of thy Lord, thou wouldst be able, through the sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. Stand firm in thy Lord's Cause, and be not disquieted by the sedition whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth have been shaken, such that creation hath been made to tremble, and thou seest men drunken upon the earth of extinction and covered with dust in the wilderness of fancy and desire. Thus hath thy Lord's Cause been made terrible in truth. And We desired, at the time when thou wast before the Throne, to cast upon thee from the matter of the veiled, concealed, and hidden One, screened from all eyes, but We forbore until God's appointed time. And when that time was fulfilled, We revealed thereof a symbol, whereupon the dwellers of earth were made to quake, and they who dwelt at Sinai in the Cause were thunderstruck, and the hearts of them that are endued with insight were afflicted by this greatest terror, and every brilliant sun was darkened. Beware, beware lest thou deprive thyself of thy Lord's power; then take up thy dwelling in the shade of the inviolability of the Cause, upon the Most Great Truth, in an exalted station, lest the arrows of allusions from them that utter words strike thee and withhold thee from the living waters in this Ridvan which standeth witnessed at the right hand of the Throne. Cast allusions behind thee, then turn thy sight unto the Greatest Outlook of God, that thou mayest know thy Lord by His own Self and be of them that know, inscribed by the Pen of God in the Mother Book.\n\nO Word of the Command! When We sent down the hosts of God's revelation with the Most Great Spirit in the garment of verses, the breasts of the people of allusions were straitened, and they stopped their ears from the melodies of their Lord. Therefore We made them deprived of the shore of grace. Proclaim unto the people the Most Great Pilgrimage to this Beauty, around Whom circumambulate the Most Great House of God, then the profane and sacred precincts, then the Ancient Temples who prostrated themselves to none save the Face that hath shone forth from the holy horizon. Set thy foot upon the head of allusions and all that preventeth thee from entering the court of thy Beloved's might. Arise with thy Lord's arising, then aid this Wronged One, and fear not those who say what they understand not and imagine themselves to be guided. Nay, by My Self, the Truth! These are not mentioned today in the presence of thy Lord. Hast thou forgotten what the Spirit cast upon thee when thou didst enter the pavilion of eternity, the blessed station of might? By God! The Most Great Division hath come and separated all atoms. Then were the spirits of all beings thunderstruck save a number before the face of thy Lord, and they are numbered temples. By God! Were the sight We gave thee to turn back, thou wouldst witness that the clouds weep for Me, the mists lament for Me, and the heaven yearneth for My Soul that hath been wronged amidst the worlds. There hath befallen Him what none can reckon save God, my Lord. Were the veil to be lifted from His face, thou wouldst be cut off from the Spirit and cry out between earth and heaven with a cry mighty indeed in truth. But We have concealed and been patient until God bringeth His Command and the vanguards of victory appear. Then will the Youth be aided by the hosts of the unseen as He was aided the first time when He was in the prison of darkness, and He brought Him forth in truth with authority from His presence and sent down upon Him tranquility from His side - and thy Lord's help was indeed nigh in truth. Say: O people! This is He through Whom all created things were illumined and the Bird of the Command soared to the station beneath whose shade all atoms took refuge. And doth anyone deny this bounty? Nay, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, save every rejected hater.\n\nSay: O people! Follow not your selfish desires, but follow the religion of the Spirit. Let not the veils of self enshroud you, for then shall ye be debarred from the love of God and His Self-Manifestation, and be drawn unto the calf. This is one of the hidden mysteries whereof We inform you, that ye may be of them that are endowed with the eye of understanding and are well-informed of the Cause.\n\nBeware, O people, lest ye reject the verses of God when they are sent down in truth, and wage war against Him by Whom the Sun of Glory hath shone forth from the horizon of manifest might. Render not your deeds vain, but rather look upon the words of God, for ye were created to hearken unto them. They shine forth amidst the words of men even as the sun shineth forth amidst the stars that have risen.\n\nBreak the idols of vain imitation by the power of your Lord, and should ye find in yourselves any weakness, seek ye strength through My sovereignty which encompasseth all the worlds.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Now doth the Tongue of God speak from the Most Exalted Horizon, saying: O people of the earth! By what proof did ye believe in 'Ali aforetime, when He came with sovereign authority and was surrounded by the hosts of manifest glory? If ye believed in Him through the verses sent down unto Him from the immortal Kingdom - divine and wondrous verses - then by God, this is My Self and these are My verses that have filled the horizons with their splendor! Why then do ye disbelieve in that which ye believed in before, hovering on the brink of repudiation, though We counseled you in all the Tablets, nay in every line, to let nothing that hath been created between earth and heaven veil you at the time of His Manifestation? Yet ye have been veiled by all things and have turned away from a Beauty manifest and glorious.\n\nO people! Arise to serve God and His Cause. Make good what hath escaped you and walk ye in the straight and holy path. O people! Neither your riches nor your children nor your deeds shall profit you this day except through My love. Thus hath the Spirit spoken from before the Throne, if ye be of them that hear.\n\nO My Name! Thus have those who stood before My face and were created by My command dealt with Me. None knoweth this save My true Self, and God is witness unto this. Had We found one with an attentive ear, We would have imparted unto him that which would make him see what is hidden from the eyes of all the heedless ones.\n\nO My Name! Leave behind all that keepeth the people veiled, then call the souls to the Most Great Paradise, that perchance there may be kindled in their hearts that which will draw them to a Beauty well-known and glorious. Leave the idolaters and what they possess, and sit not with those in whose hearts thou findest rancor against the Youth, and consort not with them, for their likeness is as the likeness of the serpent, nay worse in harm, if thou be of them that know.\n\nMake My love thy breastplate, My Cause thy fortress, and My remembrance thy name. Then shall no venom harm thee, no fire burn thee, no water drown thee, and no malicious soul affect thee. By God! Should all who are in the heavens and on earth oppose thee, God would make thee victorious over them through His sovereignty which prevaileth over all things.\n\nBeware lest anything keep thee from the love of thy Lord, for thou hast heard what no one hath heard and seen what every heedless one's eyes have failed to see.\n\nSay: O people! This is the Face of God that hath dawned above your heads. Would ye bar your sight from it? This indeed is a wrong against your own selves, and wrong is ever blameworthy. By God! The Kingdom of God walketh before you - hasten ye therefore unto it and be not deprived thereof.\n\nThus have We bestowed upon thee and inspired thee with wisdom that lay hidden beneath God's veil.\n\n=== END BH00803 ===\n\n=== START BH00804 ===\n\nO Mahmud! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious!\n\nHow sweet was that fragrance when it wafted! Blessed was the moment when this evanescent servant attained unto the perusal of that spiritual friend's letter, which was adorned with the ornament of the love of God. Nothing today hath been or shall be the cause of the heart's joy save the sweet-scented perfumes of Divine love, and no matter shall bring comfort save turning unto Him and abiding beneath the shade of the Tree of His grace. In the Hidden Words He saith, the essence of which is this: Though thou traverse all the regions of earth and heaven, thou shalt find no rest save in the shelter of My mercy. In such wise, the joy and comfort of the friends of Truth lie in their occupation with His remembrance and their firm adherence to the cord of His love.\n\nThy letter brought such joy as this servant is powerless to describe. In truth, the delight of these servants lieth in the fragrance of the Merciful's love which we inhale from one another. Woe unto them that have cast behind their backs this praiseworthy station and have taken that which was forbidden them in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Loving. O spiritual friend! Observe the baseness of the nature of the heedless souls: though the dawn of inner meanings hath broken, and the winds of the springtime of the Merciful's bounty have blown, and the fragrances from the garden of divine knowledge have been diffused, most men are occupied with inhaling foul odors and following vain imaginings. Destruction and remoteness be upon them!\n\nThis servant, in the days when the verses were being revealed and written down before the Throne, observed that mention of steadfastness, its stations and its nobility, was revealed more abundantly than other themes. And this servant was perplexed, for he had not supposed that after this Most Great Revelation, by whose rays the very embodiment of steadfastness had been adorned and the head of certitude crowned with a wondrous new diadem, anyone would be seized with perturbation, or that doubt would overtake any soul after attaining unto certitude. He had beheld those who had drunk the wine of God's love to be as firm and immovable as mountains, and had observed the people of God to be as a solid structure. Never had he imagined that a soul would become heedless of the Sun and cling to the shadow, or that after beholding the light one would turn unto darkness - until in these days some of the mysteries of the frequent revelation of verses concerning steadfastness became clear and evident. Thus hath the buzzing of flies, nay less than that, prevented some from the Lord of Lords and caused them to slip from the straight path.\n\nBy my Lord! Every kind seeketh union with its kind, and every branch returneth to its root. As mentioned, a certain one from the land of Kaf, through the whisperings of one now perished, hath in the land of Ta strayed from the extended path and been deprived of the Lord of existence. Lost indeed are the seeker and the sought, the rememberer and the remembered, the hoper and the hoped-for, the commander and the commanded. One is utterly amazed at such a being's lack of faithfulness and steadfastness - nay, the very essence of amazement beholdeth itself amazed. However, in view of the supreme compassion and mighty favor which all are commanded to show today, one must strive with the utmost endeavor to reform souls, that perchance doubting hearts may be illumined with the lights of certitude and troubled souls adorned with the ornament of assurance. Therefore it behoveth that honored one, to the extent of his \\[...\\]\n\nLet them be engaged in service to the Cause and remind the deluded souls, for the people are weak and ill, and have ever been in need of a skilled physician. We beseech God to heal them and open their eyes, their ears, and the doors of their hearts. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nThis servant at all times beseeches and hopes that the True One, exalted be His glory, may bestow upon all from His generous hand the wine of steadfastness, that they may not be deprived by foul winds from the fragrant musk of divine knowledge, nor by turbid waters from the ocean of life. Verily, He is the Bestower, and He is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAnother matter which has caused boundless grief is the discord in that land. By God, it darkens the heart of joy and gladness and sullies the hem of might and delight. Discord among the loved ones is a fire that consumes good deeds and actions. Today the glory of God's Cause lies in the unity and harmony of those who seek the Ka'bah of divine knowledge, and this matter has become the cause of grief to the Ancient Beauty, for it exalts the word of unity yet wastes the Cause through discord. To this testifies every fair-minded and discerning one. You must strive with utmost determination that the sun of unity may dawn from the horizons of hearts, and that the flames of discord may be quenched by the waters of remembrance and utterance.\n\nFurthermore, your letter was presented at the Most Holy Court, and its horizon was adorned with the crown of verses and sent forth. God willing, they will attain unto it and write their news daily, for the mention of a beloved by a beloved is counted among the sweet delights of the eternal Paradise. Convey the Most Glorious, Most Wondrous greetings to Haji Mirza Kamalu'd-Din, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy. This time this servant had no opportunity to write anything to him, as he is occupied day and night with the recording of verses. I hope for his pardon. Convey wondrous greetings to the friends of that land, and I beseech God to make them so steadfast in the Cause of the All-Merciful that they will see the loftiness of earth's mountains and their weight as more insignificant and lighter than a fly's wing, and that they may not be deprived by any deceit or stratagem from the Lord of all causes. We beseech God to protect all through His grace and give them to drink of the Kawthar of steadfastness. Verily, He is the Lord of Oneness and the Master of creation. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nAll who circle the Throne of the All-Merciful and dwell near the mercy of the Lord send their greetings. If you would send a copy of this letter to the land of Kaf, it would be most beloved, that all may become aware of steadfastness and its stations.\n\nAgain it is submitted that if you meet Mir 'Abdu'l-Baqi, tell him to consider the Tablet that was previously revealed specifically for him, that perchance he may be reminded or fear. This servant mentions some verses of that blessed Tablet. His exalted Word:\n\nStand thou firm in the Cause in such wise that neither the veils of the people of creation prevent thee, nor the doubts of any uncertain learned one disturb thee. By God, he who has recognized the One to be recognized is the knower, and he who has turned to the Known One, he indeed is the true learned one whom God has made to be among the letters of the Book \\[...\\] Verily, he who has believed is among the companions of guidance amidst humanity, and he who has turned away is among the people of tyranny before thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nSay: Given these conclusive divine exhortations and verses of transcendent, eternal glory, how is it that you have passed by the Source of knowledge on the word of an ignorant one, and have turned away from the breezes of revelation, drawn to the exhalations of error? We beseech God to guide him and make him steadfast in the Cause of God. This is the most glorious, most exalted, most sublime station. Until one succeeds in rending asunder the veils of majesty, it is difficult to attain to this station, save whom God willeth.\n\n=== END BH00804 ===\n\n=== START BH00805 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power\n\nPraise befitteth and is meet for the Lord of existence Who, through His pure bounty, hath made manifest the world of being through the Word of His command, and hath ordained such means as lead to fellowship, unity, comfort and concord, that all may attain true repose in the cradle of security and peace, and become occupied in and give voice to divine praise. Great is His favor and His bestowals are beyond measure and reckoning. At every moment the signs of His greatness are made manifest and the waves of the ocean of His mercy are resplendent. Blessed is the soul that hath not let slip the time and hath clung to the hem of the Lord's generosity. The servant beseecheth his Lord not to withhold His servants from the outpourings of His days, nor to deprive them of that which hath appeared from the horizon of the heaven of His grace. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.\n\nMy soul be offered up for your remembrance, your praise, and your steadfastness. Your esteemed letter arrived during a time when the rains of divine bounty were falling in the divine springtime. After reading it and inhaling the fragrances of the flowers of meaning that had bloomed in the garden of divine decree, I presented myself before His presence. He said: \"We have ever beseeched and continue to beseech the Eternal Truth that He withhold not the glances of His favor and deprive not His Afnan of the fruits of the Tree of Glory and Mercy.\n\nO Ali, upon thee be My peace. This Wronged One hath at all times considered the honor of thy person and the preservation of thy station, and continues to do so. The True One, exalted be His glory, hath ordained means for every thing and every matter, as He hath said: 'God hath refused to cause things to happen except through their means.' One must hold fast to these means. According to what his honor Aqa Siyyid Mirza, upon him be God's peace, hath written, your honor must not be remiss in gathering these means. It is strange that until now the brethren have not known what has entered and what has left the storehouse in Beirut, and the cause of their lack of knowledge has been the delay in your books and accounts. Now it is necessary and obligatory that you send a clear account so all may understand what has transpired.\n\nO Ali, the blame for these matters falls upon the Dayspring of Justice, for they are unaware and know not. Often it happens that, due to your stillness in this land, they suppose the reason for not sending funds or accounts was the House. This Wronged One has ever called all to trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and sincerity, yet proper action is not evident. One must at all times hold fast to the cord of trustworthiness and religiosity, and the state of these two is truly not known - whether they have been implemented or not. Knowledge thereof is with God, the Knower of the unseen \\[...\\]\n\nThey were greatly astonished and said that it would be very bad if Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Mustafa were to learn of this. Then, in consideration of preserving your standing and protecting the Cause, a false statement was made about its receipt. If truthfulness and trustworthiness are not observed in these minor matters, what will become of major affairs? After receiving it, they should either send it or write that it needs to be used if permission is granted. Assuredly whatever is available and necessary for you will certainly be given. You have been with us for some time and are aware of the trustworthiness and operations of the House. One must reflect on matters and act with perfect trustworthiness and faithfulness. At present what is advisable is that the sum you received from the House to give to the money-changer - if you have given it, take it back, and if you have not given it, do not give it, for perhaps again some people will intervene and create confusion as happened in Istanbul where everything was lost. In this case it is better that the money-changer remain a creditor. This matter, in consideration of present expediency and preservation of funds, is good. Be not disturbed about affairs. In the past and present, things heavier than mountains have befallen people, but after despair and loss of hope, God's grace encompassed them. Be not grieved. With utmost joy and steadfastness in the Name of God, exalted be His glory, remove negligence and attend to setting matters in order so all may know no betrayal occurred and nothing was lost. Now Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mirza is placing and continues to place all blame on Aqa Siyyid Ahmad and you, and in truth he is right, for you do not write what has happened. In any case, hear the Wronged One's counsel. And regarding Muhammad Mahdi's store, if it contains people's property that you wish to send, it is not permitted. We counsel you to observe trustworthiness and its conditions, and faithfulness and its rights. From the letters of the honored Afnan, Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mirza and His Holiness Haji Siyyid Muhammad, upon them both be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, it appears they suppose you have funds in your possession. This matter must be clarified so this accusation does not return upon you and the above. This matter is most necessary and obligatory. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist you with the means of the heavens and earth and to open before your faces the gates of divine gifts and favors. Verily He is the Giver, the Forgiving, the Generous. I send greetings to the friends in that land and declare \"Would that I were with them!\" Regarding affairs, act according to whatever the Greater Afnan deems advisable, as commanded. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon God's righteous servants.\n\n=== END BH00805 ===\n\n=== START BH00808 ===\n\nPort Said.

Praise be to God Who united hearts and manifested from this unity what He desired. Verily, He is the Master of creation in both beginning and end.\n\nThe flowing pen of that beloved of the heart somewhat consoled and brought solace to this grief-stricken heart from the oppression of the earth. Were it not for the gentle breezes of love for His loved ones, the heart would burst and existence would not be sustained. After reading, proceeding toward the supreme heights, it was presented before His face. His mighty utterance states: O thou who gazest toward the horizon of justice and turneth to the lights of grace! In these days this Wronged One moveth in a world of despair, for the labors of forty years and the manifest, all-encompassing favors have all been observed to be wasted and fruitless. How many saplings of hope We planted and cultivated with hands of grace and bounty in various lands, yet no fruit thereof is visible and no trace apparent, for the poisonous winds intervened and prevented the waters of mercy. Night and day the Supreme Pen moved in kind counsels and wise admonitions, removing discord, contention, strife and enmity through the power and might of the Kingdom of utterance. Nevertheless, neither are the rulers content nor the divines pleased. The toil of those mentioned years was scattered to the winds, and now the lamp is observed amidst tempests. None of the rulers of Iran comprehended why this Most Great Party maintained such silence and stillness, and what caused their lack of resistance and defense. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The nobles of that land fell upon the pure and holy bodies like wolves of the earth and committed that which caused the Most Great Sorrow. In brief, the beasts of the isles of heedlessness have surrounded the rulers. Beseech God to protect the rulers. By Thy life, O Observer! They have no helper and no champion; they cry out for help but none assists them, for the darkness of oppression hath seized the world. None with understanding is observed who might comprehend. At every moment a new fire is kindled and wailing and lamentation is raised. This Wronged One beseeches God to transform the fire of oppression into the light of justice, and tyranny into equity.\n\nMy God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Places of Thy verses and the Manifestations of Thy Cause, and by the Seat whereon He Who conversed with Thee on Sinai sat, and by the Throne which Thou hast adorned through its connection to the Dayspring of Revelation, to transform the turning away of Thy servants into acceptance, their denial into acknowledgment, and their oppression into justice. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones and loved ones in a position where from all sides are heard the barking of the dogs of self and passion. I beseech Thee to protect them through Thy sovereignty and ordain for them that which will make them powerful through Thy might and wealthy through Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO beloved of my heart! A year has passed during which, in outward matters, disturbances have appeared. The evil ones of the earth, due to their enmity towards the honored Afnan, upon them be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, have resorted to calumnies that have caused delays in affairs. We hope that this stillness will swiftly be transformed to motion and this delay to movement - a movement and swiftness that will attract the world and teach a new way. In certain nights and days, mention of you has been and is made in the presence of the Master. Repeatedly He has said: \"We beseech God to soon make manifest means that will cause the elevation of the station of the Overseer, upon him be Baha.\" This servant states with clear certainty that assuredly after these difficulties and these complex and perplexing matters, and these hindering doubts and suspicions, all shall be transformed - difficulties to ease, hardship to facility, and doubts and suspicions to the light of certitude. Praise be to God Who has ordained for His loved ones that which nothing can equal. Verily He is the Powerful through His Most Exalted Name. The hardship and constraints in your affairs have repeatedly been mentioned. We hope that the Opener of Doors and Turner of Hearts will manifest for His loved ones that which brings peace and tranquility. I convey greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for bounty, generosity and grace for each one, whereby the fame of His loved ones may be raised among His servants. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nIn these days what has occurred is that His Excellency the Ambassador Mu'in-ul-Mulk has made representations seeking benefit in his affairs, as the Persian government has summoned him, but having become aware of their intentions he has delayed his return and has sought counsel. For some time he has been showing love and friendship. He \\[Baha'u'llah\\] said: \"We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to transform this outward friendship into true love. He is the Powerful and the Mighty.\"\n\nRegarding what you wrote about proceeding to a certain place for the supreme martyrdom, after it was presented He said: \"The honored Overseer, upon him be God's peace and glory, has repeatedly attained this bounty. In the path of God most of his days have been spent in exile and hardship. How many taunts he has heard and torments he has tasted! Each of these instances is cause for martyrdom and reason for sacrificing one's existence. And if something appears that causes a Tablet to be sent, we shall entrust it to that devoted one. Praise be to God, that beloved one has attained to that which has no equal. This mention of martyrdom is mighty. Assuredly that beloved one knows and recognizes its worth and station.\" This servant also beseeches God to accompany and share the same purpose, that perhaps he may succeed in sacrificing his spirit in the path of his Lord and King. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the Wise.\n\nAt this moment mention was made by the Master of the spiritual beloved and apple of our eye, His honor Aqa Mirza Habibu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God. He said: \"O Habib! Upon thee be My peace and glory! God is witness and the heart testifies that the gaze of favor has been and is directed towards thee. We beseech God to manifest through thee that which will cause the exaltation of the blessed, goodly Word. Convey greetings to the leaf on behalf of the Wronged One. We send greetings to all the loved ones of that place - his honor Nuru'llah and Muhammad and the others - and we counsel them to pure, holy and sanctified deeds.\"\n\nO my God, my God! I beseech Thee to gather Thy loved ones beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy providence, then rain down upon them from the heaven of Thy mercy the showers of Thy glory and bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nThis servant also conveys greetings, remembrance and glory to that spiritual friend, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant that delight of the eyes boundless grace. Verily our Lord is the Bestower, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nGreetings, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you, and upon those who are sincere and devoted. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n14 Safar 1309\n\n=== END BH00808 ===\n\n=== START BH00811 ===\n\nHis honor Aqa Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God\n\nHe is the Everlasting One, manifest and evident from the Most Glorious Horizon\n\nThe exalted Arabic Tablet was sent. Now in the Persian tongue the wondrous holy divine words are being revealed. Blessed are they that hear! The Truth, exalted be His mention, has ever been and shall ever be sanctified above manifestation and appearance - an unknowable Mystery, an imperceptible Concealment, an unmanifested Inner Reality, an unhidden Treasure, and an unwitnessed Secret. For the term \"mystery\" applies only when something is not witnessed; in such case it is not manifest that it might be known. And after witnessing, the term \"mystery\" no longer exists that it might be understood. Therefore the Mystery has been and shall ever be unknowable. Blessed is the soul that ponders this perfect, firm, divine Word and attains to the jewel of its purpose which is deposited in that Treasure. Should any soul claim to know the Mystery as it is in itself, such a one has been and shall ever be among the falsifiers. That Ancient Beauty is too exalted to be known through aught but Himself, and too sublime to be described save through His own holy Being. For whatever created beings may comprehend at the ultimate degree of their understanding is but a fancy they have invented for themselves by themselves. Exalted is He above being known by that which is contingent! And since the doors of knowledge and understanding were closed, and the ultimate degree of the servants' knowledge rejected, the King of existence, through His grace and bounty, made the Manifestations of His Oneness and Daysprings of His eternal might to appear from the horizon of \"Verily I am the One manifest above all things,\" that all people might attain to the knowledge of God through recognition of these Suns rising from the horizon of truth, and might be blessed with obedience to God and conformity with His good-pleasure through obedience to these holy Beings. And in accordance with justice and the manifestation of grace, He bestowed upon each of these eternal and glorious Manifestations a proof and evidence, that no soul might have excuse to turn away or object, and that the divine proof might be complete and perfect for all. The purpose of this greatest grace is that people might be educated, that perchance they may enter the kingdom of the divine countenance and attain to the station where \"thy Lord's face endureth\" - which is the ultimate goal of human existence - and may abide forever. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that if a soul becomes purified and sanctified from this world even once and ascends to the Supreme Companion, he will never see extinction but will attain unto existence within existence, and annihilation and extinction shall never find their way to this existence and subsistence. But what benefit when these people with their impure hearts do not comprehend this divine melody? In any case, these glorious divine Manifestations have existed from the beginning that has no beginning until the time ended with the wondrous First Manifestation in the garment of the Last, and the Primal Point, exalted be His grandeur, elevated be His signs, and mighty be His glory, rose from the Most Exalted Horizon and guided the people to the pathway of eternity. All the servants clung to their religious leaders among the divines and never turned to the Essence of Divine Unity, although He appeared with such compelling proof that all found themselves powerless to produce the like thereof. Then they arose in opposition and demanded supernatural signs. That Ancient Being wrote the treatise of proofs known as the Seven Proofs, wherein He showed that all proof and evidence terminates in verses, and from the holy Pen flowed that today \\[...\\]\n\nThese verses which have descended from the clouds of glory are a testimony unto both East and West, and no testimony greater than this hath been or ever shall be. Even as the Crown Prince summoned that Essence of Eternality to his court and demanded proof, that Ancient Beauty declared that the verses were the testimony. Yet in the end they accepted it not, and all pronounced sentence of death upon that Quintessence of pre-existence, save a few who became assured through the divine verses and turned from the west of unbelief and error to the east of faith and recognition.\n\nThereafter did that Pre-existent Being, in all His revealed tablets, give glad tidings to all of this Most Great Revelation, such that not a single line of the Bayan was revealed except that this most glorious mention was recorded therein, and He counseled all lest they remain, at the time of His manifestation, veiled from the Beauty of the All-Merciful by the letters of the Bayan and the words revealed therein, even as the people of the Furqan. Despite these counsels, and this Most Great Revelation, and this most holy and glorious Dawning which hath appeared with all divine power and with all the proofs of the Manifestations of abiding glory, all have turned away.\n\nWould that they had contented themselves with what the people of the Furqan committed, for the people of the Furqan merely pronounced sentence of death upon the Beauty of the All-Glorious. But this people have striven to cut down the divine Tree, and when they found themselves powerless, they loosened their tongues in calumny. Surely by now the clamor of the polytheists hath reached that land. Yet praise be to God that they have attributed to this most pure Essence such things that any soul possessing the least grain of discernment and the tiniest particle of insight would perceive that these calumnies have issued from the source of rancor, the treasury of envy, and the mine of hatred. Therefore do the tongues of all atoms proclaim: \"The curse of God be upon the first oppressor who wronged the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation, who warred against Him, who disputed His verses, who denied His presence, and who then calumniated Him.\"\n\nO servant! Such is the condition of these immature souls. For twenty years hath the Ancient Beauty been in the hands of His enemies, such that at every moment He hath been exposed to destruction - at times imprisoned by His foes, at times in chains and fetters, at times captive to the wicked. Yet despite this they have attributed worldliness and love thereof to this Essence of Spirit, though all the world and whatsoever is therein were His creation. And if the Temple of the Throne were to rest upon a ground of diamonds, it would be befitting - nay, worthy of even the servants at His threshold. Yet I swear by the King of Pre-existence that they who circle round His court have been and shall ever remain sanctified above the world and all that is therein. Indeed, were anyone to observe, he would not find even a penny of worldly goods or belongings with the emigrants. Praise be to my Beloved, Who hath created all to be patient and thankful.\n\nThey have mentioned these words and their like only to cast doubt in hearts, unaware that the deed of Truth is even as the manifest and shining sun, and every possessor of sight hath perceived and will perceive it. O servant! With spiritual wings soar to the divine holy heaven, and having purified thyself from the hints of all else but God, gaze upon the Most Great Scene. I swear by the Truth that My tribulation is greater than can be mentioned\\[...\\]\n\nMy grief and sorrow are greater than can be recorded by the pen. I pour out my sorrow and lamentation unto God, and verily, He is the best Protector and the best Helper. God willing, in these days you will not be deprived of the wondrous favors of the eternal Sovereign, nor be forbidden from partaking of the peerless nectar of the All-Glorious. And the Glory be upon you and upon all who are with you among the believers who are steadfast, assured, patient and thankful.\n\n=== END BH00811 ===\n\n=== START BH00813 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy!\n\nThis is a Book from the presence of Baha to those whom God hath preserved from the shame of self and passion, and caused them to enter the pavilion of the Most Glorious through His grace. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. That the breezes of the All-Merciful may waft over them from this distant quarter and remind them in these days wherein every tree proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise.\"\n\nGive thanks unto God for having delivered you through His sovereignty and preserved you through the hosts of the seen and the unseen, until He made you recognize the Manifestation of His Self, before Whom the Faithful Spirit doth speak. The Kingdom of God hath appeared and been established upon the throne, the Beloved of the worlds. Through Him were opened the gates of reunion before the faces of the Prophets and Messengers, all of whom drew strength from His remembrance and rejoiced in His mighty, glorious Name.\n\nUntil We sent 'Ali in truth and made him the herald of this wise Remembrance. Verily, he spoke not from desire, but through that which We inspired him with from Our greatest signs. He was the one who called out on land and sea, summoning the people to the Greatest Scene. When the veils were rent asunder and the All-Bestower came in the shadows of clouds, all the tribes of the earth were thrown into confusion, the suns of idle fancies were darkened, and the moon of vain imaginings was eclipsed. Thus was the matter decreed from God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nThose who remained immersed in the oceans of vain imaginings after the Sun of Certitude had dawned from the horizon of divine inspiration are indeed among the idolaters. We have left them to themselves and delivered those who held fast to the handle of grace - these are among the sincere ones.\n\nWe have sent down the Bayan in such wise that none hath excuse save that he turn unto God or be numbered with the perishing ones. God hath made the Bayan a gift unto My Self and adorned it with My mighty, wondrous Name, such that every word thereof proclaimeth: \"The Beloved of the worlds hath come!\" Yet when that which was the purpose of all Tablets appeared, the people of the Bayan who claim allegiance to the All-Merciful opposed Him and committed that which the Pen is powerless to recount. To this doth the Ancient Beauty testify, if ye be of those who know.\n\nAmong them were those who sought to take My life, and those who said He hath fabricated a lie against God, even after each of My deeds testifieth to God's Manifestation, His sovereignty, might and grandeur. Thus do We recount unto you that which We have reckoned. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nDo ye object to Him through Whom the Most Exalted Pen was set in motion and through Whose appearance every leaf of the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary doth speak? O people of creation! This is He concerning Whom God took your covenant in all the Tablets. Fear ye the All-Merciful and be not of those who violated the Covenant and denied God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nBy My life! He who hath ears hath heard God's call and hath detached himself for love of Him from all the worlds. And he who hath eyes beholdeth God's power in this mighty News. Those who have denied - they are deaf and blind. Their names shall not be mentioned before the Throne; they are among those who have perished.\n\nThen know, O My loved ones, weakness hath seized Me to such degree that My tongue is hindered from remembrance and utterance. When a Tablet or two descend from the direction of the Throne, weakness overtaketh Me on account of what hath befallen My body from those who turned away from the Countenance and showed pride before God, the Mighty, the Wise. Yet the Spirit remaineth in such strength and power that no created thing can \\[...\\]\n\nFirst and foremost, He calls out at all times and summons the concourse of creation to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. He is never still, praising his Lord by night and day, and nothing frightens Him even if He faces what no one before Him has faced at the hands of the oppressors. When the idolaters cast Us into this Most Great Prison, We desired to convey the Cause to the kings and rulers, and We did convey it to them with a sovereignty from Us and a power from Our presence, even while We were in the hands of Our enemies. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nArise to aid your Lord, that perchance through your mention those who slumber on the couch of heedlessness and pride may be awakened. This is what you have been commanded by the Supreme Pen after My establishment upon the throne of My Most Great Name. Let not the opposition of those on earth grieve you. Cling to the hem of your Lord's mercy; He will verily suffice you in truth, and He is the Protector of those near ones who speak His praise and glorification among the servants. These are the companions of Baha, whose names have been inscribed by this Luminous Pen.\n\nLet not the world grieve you. Follow your Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. In hardship and tribulation He calls the people to this Straight Path. Do sorrows overtake you while you see yourselves beneath the canopy of your Lord's mercy, the Most Merciful? Rejoice in My joy, then turn to the Kingdom of eternity and what has been ordained for you by God, the Lord of Names. By My life! This is better than all that has been created in the kingdoms of heaven and earth.\n\nRead My verses with joy and fragrance; they will draw you to God and make you detached from all else. This is how you have been counseled in the Tablets and in this Clear Tablet. Beware lest you exceed the bounds of wisdom. Preserve the Cause among you lest discord arise and the hearts of the weak be troubled. Should anyone come to you with the writing of the wicked, cast it behind you, then read to him a tablet from the tablets of your Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. If you see in his face the radiance of the All-Merciful, turn to him; but if it is covered with the dust of fire, leave him and turn with your hearts to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nWe have sent down to you before clear verses to comfort your eyes, and We have sufficed in this instance with this Mighty Tablet. Command My male and female servants to purity and righteousness, that they may arise from the slumber of passion and turn to God, Creator of earth and heaven. Thus did We command the servants when the light of the horizons dawned from the direction of Iraq. Among the people are those who broke the Covenant, and among them are those who followed what was commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\n\nMy harm is not My imprisonment and tribulation, nor what befalls Me from the tyrants among My servants, but rather the deeds of those who attribute themselves to this Wronged One and commit that which causes the sanctity of God to be lost among His creation. They are assuredly among the corrupt. Those who spread corruption in the land and seize people's property and enter houses without permission - I am innocent of them unless they repent and return to God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus have We revealed in most tablets that they might become aware within themselves and follow the truth in their days. Among them are those who accepted and those who rejected, and those who accepted are among the near ones.\n\nBlessed are you, O My loved ones, for My Pen has flowed with your names and My tongue has spoken your mention in My imprisonment and tribulation, that it might draw you to the Kingdom.\n\nIt will acquaint you with My grandeur and power, and will bring you to such a station that you will behold naught but My beauty and hear naught but My call. Cast away all else save Me and take the chalice of My remembrance from the hand of My bounty and favour. Then drink deeply therefrom in My Name and My sovereignty. By My life! It will cause you to become detached from all else but Me and draw you nigh unto that which We have desired for you in the realm of My power. Thus have We revealed unto you Our verses and caused the sun of My loving-kindness to shine forth upon you from the horizon of My bounty, that you may become aware of My love for you, My compassion towards you, and My tender care for those who have turned their faces to My resplendent and luminous countenance. Spirit and glory be upon you, O companions of guidance and people of Baha, from the presence of One Who is mighty and wise.

Blessed is he who hath made mention of thee and sent thee a letter that spoke of My remembrance and bore witness to him who sent it unto thee. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.\n\nHis letter came before Us aforetime. We read it and revealed for every name mentioned therein that which will draw him nigh unto the highest pinnacle. To this doth this momentous announcement testify.\n\nO 'Ayn-Qabil-Ta!

We make mention of thee and those in thy household with such remembrance as to attract the hearts of them that are endued with understanding. We make mention of thy brother who was named Rahim in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We counsel him and those who have believed to observe trustworthiness and godliness and whatsoever will exalt the station of man in the contingent world. Exalted is the Most Merciful Who hath made mention of His loved ones and aided them in that which will draw them nigh unto Him.

Be not grieved at what hath befallen thee. We speak the truth when We say that thy daughter hath attained unto such bounties in the Most Exalted Paradise as the understanding of the peoples of the world hath not and never shall comprehend. Be thou gladdened by God's favor. Set not thy heart upon the abode of tribulation. Fix thy gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon and upon that which God hath ordained for His loved ones. One verse revealed from the Most Exalted Pen is worth a hundred thousand times more than the most noble offspring, for that which proceedeth from God shall endure throughout the sovereignty of earth and heaven. The fragrance of the All-Merciful from His utterance hath never been and shall never be cut off. Rejoice thou in this most great favor, then render thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\n\nO Shukru'llah! Thou hast attained unto that which the champions of the earth, its horsemen, princes and divines were debarred from attaining. Preserve this most exalted station through the name of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Beware lest the world and its vicissitudes, its glory and favors, debar thee from God, the Lord of all worlds. All that thou beholdest today shall perish. Take thou that which shall serve as a light unto thee, an illumination, a helper and companion in all the worlds of thy Lord. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Having taken the cup of My loving-kindness and drunk therefrom the choice wine of My utterance, say: My God, my God! Thou seest me advancing towards that whereunto Thou hast bidden me turn, clinging to Thy Most Firm Handle, and awaiting the wonders of Thy mercy, O Lord of all being and King of the throne above and the earth below. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy love which hath enkindled the hearts of Thy chosen ones, and by the wine of Thy utterance which hath attracted the hearts of Thy loved ones and so transported them through the potency of Thy Word that they hastened unto Thy good-pleasure - neither were they held back by the ranks of the oppressors from turning to the light of Thy countenance, nor by the might of the aggressors from drawing nigh unto Thy station - to assist me to serve Thee and to exalt Thy Word. I moreover beseech Thee, O Creator of the world and Educator of the nations, by the movement of Thy finger and by that which hath flowed from Thy Pen, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and enable them to do that which Thou lovest and approvest. Verily, Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO My Name! The letter from Ghulam, upon him be My glory, was seen. Mention of him hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, yet it reached him not. The servant present before Our face did, as commanded, dispatch a detailed letter, which likewise did not arrive. Glory be to God! From the day that Abu-Jahl entered this land in the name of Muhammad, there occurred a delay in the sending of Tablets, and of those that were sent, some did not arrive, including the Tablets of Aqa Ghulam-'Ali from the people of Kaf, who attained Our presence and heard the call from the Most Exalted Horizon and drank the most glorious wine from the hands of bounty. A package of Tablets was also sent from the land of Ta in the name of Amin, upon him be the glory of God, which did not arrive, and likewise the Tablets which you specifically sent for the honored Rashti, upon him be the eternal glory of God, these too did not arrive. Now send the Tablet which was revealed several months ago specifically for Ghulam from the heaven of the Divine Will and which is available. Mention of the people of that household, all of them, hath been and is before the Wronged One, and We have also commanded the servant present to send copies of what has not arrived.\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My glory! Praise be to God, thou dwellest in the vicinity and reposest beneath the canopies of grandeur. Thou bearest witness to the abundance of writing. In truth, outwardly there is no opportunity - groups are constantly engaged in writing, yet the answers to most remain delayed. Say: O Ghulam! By the life of God, thou and those with thee have been and are mentioned. From the beginning of days there hath been revealed that which is the cause of everlasting mention and eternal bounty. O Ghulam! Repeatedly make mention of the kinsmen from the Wronged One, and likewise the loved ones of that land. All are mentioned and have attained God's favor. Say: O My loved ones! Be ye united and in accord. Each one must be so enkindled with the fire of God's love that its effects encompass the earth. The water of life is God's utterance, as are His evidences. Strive that perchance the people of the world may attain eternal life through this everlasting fountain and illumine creation with the light of wisdom and utterance.\n\nVerily, We make mention of Jalal as a favor from Us, and We have adorned him with the ornament of Our signs, and We have sent down that which cooleth the eyes of the servants. Convey My glorification unto his face and illumine it with the lights of My wondrous utterance.\n\nAt the end of the Tablet We make mention of the leaf Narjis and give her the glad-tidings of God's favor. Thy petition arrived and at this hour, two hours past nightfall, it attained unto hearing before the Face. Praise the Goal of all creation that He heard thy call and at that moment the answer was revealed from the heaven of bounty. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds! And thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones! The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have not violated God's Covenant and His Testament, whom the power of the world hath not weakened and whom the hosts of the nations have not frightened. They have turned with radiant faces unto the Supreme Horizon and have said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, for having aided us to turn unto Thee, to hearken unto Thy call, and to recognize Thy straight Path and Thine unshakeable and mighty Cause.\"\n\n=== END BH00815 ===\n\n=== START BH00817 ===\n\nHe is the Manifest Interpreter\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Friend and awaitest the appearance of the Glorious One! Know thou that We have read the Gospel and with Us are its meanings and mysteries which none hath discovered save whom God willeth. Then know that wisdom requireth giving to each seeker his measure. The ocean containeth what is in the cup, but the cup cannot contain what is in the ocean. The cup hath been given according to its capacity and the ocean according to its measure. Ponder that thou mayest be of them that comprehend. We give the thirsty to drink of the wine of understanding - verily it is the Kawthar of life. Blessed are they that drink thereof.\n\nConsider when Jesus was asked at the time when the Pharisees had gathered round Him; He said to the questioner: \"Thou sayest,\" and gave no other answer. Thus was the matter ordained in the Book. The hour hath come wherein the Spirit glorified His Lord, but ponder thou that hour whose knowledge was concealed from all who are on earth, and none discovered it save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Whoso attaineth its recognition at the time of its manifestation hath attained eternal life and entered the Kingdom and partaken of what hath been perfected therein. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the utterance and turned towards it, detached from all else.\n\nBeware lest the veils hinder thee. Look, then remember when the Spirit came: He was denied by the Pharisees who possessed knowledge of the Law and its minutiae, while those who caught fish believed in Him, as did those who were publicans. Take heed and be of them that remember. Reflect upon the cause of these men's rejection and the reason for those men's acceptance, that the truth may become manifest to thee and thou mayest behold the light shining from its manifest and luminous horizon.\n\nAmong the Pharisees were those who cited the Torah as proof of His falsity, after the Torah had testified of Him and what was revealed in the scrolls of the Messengers. Had they understood the Books and what God intended therein, they would not have been debarred from recognizing that which was their purpose. To this testifieth every fair-minded one possessed of knowledge. When they interpreted what was in the Books according to their desires, they were veiled from the Spirit and committed that which caused the eyes of them that are nigh to shed tears.\n\nWe have cast thee into the depths of these allusions that which sufficeth thee, wouldst thou ponder them with a pure and sanctified and illumined heart. Blessed is the eye that seeth, the ear that heareth, the hand that graspeth, and the heart that turneth unto the Lord of great glory. Among the people are those who turn to Him through their desires, and among them are those who turn according to what their Lord desireth. Blessed is he whose desire is what his Lord, the Mighty, the Great, desireth.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked concerning my condition, know thou that I am a captive, and I would that trees had been cut down for my name and a portion of my body crucified upon each one of them. Thus do We impart unto thee that thou mayest be of them that comprehend. We beseech God to draw thee nigh unto Him and cause thee to hear the melody of the Dove which warbleth upon the branches in diverse notes. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.\n\nO thou who gazest! Know that this is a Day wherein questioning beseemeth no one. It hath been ordained for every soul that, when he heareth the Call from the direction of the snow-white Spot, he should hasten and say: \"Here am I, O God of earth and heaven, Creator of names!\" Woe betide them who were not stirred by the breezes of the All-Merciful in those days and were not awakened by the scratching of His Most Exalted Pen. They have not risen from among the dead, nor attained unto that for which they were created. We testify that they are of the dead.\n\nThe appointed time hath come, the Hour hath struck, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth hath appeared. Thou didst leave thy home, turning toward the Spot wherein the Manifestation was promised in the tablets of God, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Thou hast reached the sea and beholdest its waves. Beware lest vain imaginings prevent thee from immersing thyself therein. Seek assistance through the Name of thy Lord, then enter it, stripped of the garments of allusion. Thus wilt thou find its pearls and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Quickener of the worlds!\"\n\nWe see the veil to be thin. Rend it with the finger of certitude that thou mayest behold the Sun of Beauty shining from behind it and be of them that attain. Beware lest that which prevented the divines of the earth when the Spirit came with the kingdom of His Lord, the Mighty, the Generous, prevent thee. Shouldst thou hear what the Tongue of Eternity addresseth unto thee, thou wouldst abandon all thou hast and turn toward the Station before which the Kingdom crieth out: \"The King of Kings hath come with great glory!\"\n\nReflect on that which hath flowed from the Pen that thou mayest find therefrom the fragrance of eternity. This is of His grace upon thee and upon the peoples, if thou be of them that turn. Withhold not thy tongue from the remembrance of thy Lord, nor thine eyes from gazing upon the scene of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Arise from among the dead in the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and be thou one that crieth out His remembrance amidst His heedless servants.\n\nBlessed is the heart that hath drunk what hath flowed in those days, and the temple that hath attained to standing in the presence of the All-Merciful and been honored with that which was promised in the Book from One true and faithful. Shouldst thou turn toward the Bell, thou wouldst hear from it the name of thy Lord, and shouldst thou look upon the Law, thou wouldst find it adorned with this wondrous remembrance.\n\nHow many Pharisees secluded themselves in temples awaiting the days of Christ, yet when He came with the truth from the heaven of thy Lord's will, they denied Him and were of the oppressors! How many learned ones were barred from the ocean of knowledge, and how many ignorant ones hastened, drank, and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\" How many wise ones were heedless of the Purpose, and how many children turned and attained unto that which their Lord, the Mighty, the Impregnable, desired! How many women arrived and attained unto the presence of the Spirit and His knowledge, and how many men of power kept far from that noble Scene!\n\nWe beseech God to make thee a champion of His Cause and a servant of His Manifestation, and to make thee a standard of guidance among creation, that thy remembrance may endure in the realm below and thy spirit in the Kingdom above. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth \\[...\\]\n\nVerily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. When thou hast drunk from the Kawthar of life and attained unto that which the All-Merciful hath desired for thee, detach thyself wholly from all else, then turn with radiant countenance unto thy Lord. The Most Holy Sanctuary hath been adorned with the mention of thy Lord, the Lord of all names, and the land of Batha hath been stirred by the call of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. Wilt thou remain still when all things have been set in motion by this Name, at Whose revelation all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunder-struck, save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath willed? The Temple hath been raised by the hand of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness and adorned with the ornament of utterance. Is this better for you, or that which hath been built of clay? Judge ye fairly, if ye be of them that know. From the right hand of the Throne there hath been raised a Call whereby the Pens were struck dumb, the Tablets were shaken, and the dwellers of the heavens and earth were thrown into confusion. The Kawthar of life hath flowed by the will of the All-Merciful, and the choice wine of immortality is bestowed by the hands of bounty. Take ye and drink in My Name, whereby all in the worlds have been subdued. Cast behind you the intimations of self; this is your Lord Who hath come with His holy kingdom, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Do the might of kings or the cawing of the owned one frighten you? He, verily, aideth whom He willeth through a sovereignty from His presence, and He is indeed the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. If thou findest weakness in thyself, seek strength through the power of thy Lord, and if thou perceivest lassitude in thyself, speak forth this remembrance that thou mayest be attracted by the signs of thy Lord and soar in the atmosphere of His love. Then wilt thou hear the cry of all things: \"Blessed be God, the most excellent of creators!\" Thus have We adorned the Kingdom with the lights of the Divine Realm and caused the sun of thy Lord's beauty to shine forth from its horizon, the All-Knowing, the Ancient of Days. When thou hast attained unto this, draw near and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds!\"\n\n=== END BH00817 ===\n\n=== START BH00818 ===\n\nO 'Ali! Some time ago, there was revealed especially for the rulers of the earth that by which the fragrance of bounty hath encompassed all save those who cling to the cord of tyranny and hold fast to the hem of wickedness. Now again thy petition hath attained unto the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to aid all to hearken unto the Call raised from the Lote-Tree of Sinai and to arise to serve the Cause as beseemeth it. The Sun hath proclaimed \"The All-Bestowing hath come!\" and all things have announced \"The Lord of Names hath come!\" Blessed is the ear that hath hearkened and arisen to serve, and woe unto him who hath denied and was of the heedless.O Jahanbakhsh! Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the bounty of the True Possessor. All the treasures of the world cannot equal that which God hath bestowed. Faith, recognition and understanding are each a garment of God's grace, glory be to His majesty. He adorneth therewith whomsoever He willeth of His creation and withholdeth it from whomsoever He desireth of His servants. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Know thou the worth of this blessed garment and deprive not thy heart of its adorning. We beseech God to aid thee and strengthen thee with the hosts of utterance. Verily He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.O Naqi-Qabli-Khan! Today the Call is raised and the world is perfumed with the fragrance of the Revelation. He who desireth to hear, heareth, and he who desireth to see, seeth. From the beginning of this Revelation, when the ocean of bounty surged, We removed the word \"never\" and appeared without veil or covering. Blessed is the eye that hath seen and the ear that hath heard. We beseech God to aid thee to steadfastness in this Great Cause. Verily He is the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names.O 'Abbas-Qabli-Kha! The tale of Sinai hath returned and its mysteries are made manifest. The Blessed Tree speaketh, in this moment uttering \"I believe in Thee, O Lord of the worlds!\" From this verse the loftiness of this Revelation is evident before the faces of the discerning and the perspicacious. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and beseech God that He may aid thee in that which causeth the fragrance of eternity to waft and the light of His good-pleasure to shine forth. Verily thy Lord is the Fulfiller of the needs of the seekers, the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Generous.O Ilyas Bey! The Lord of mankind saith: This is the Day wherein man can attain unto everlasting stations, eternal bounties, heavenly sustenance, and endless favors. Strive thou and beseech God that perchance thou mayest enter the depths of oneness and behold the world as non-existent and null. Knowest thou Who hath remembered thee from the precincts of the Prison? Say: God, the Speaker, the Utterer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to assist thee in His remembrance and praise and to draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! We have heard thy call and have called thee from the realm of grandeur. Verily there is no God but Him, the Lord of all things, the Creator of earth and heaven. Rejoice that the face of God hath turned toward thee and hath remembered thee with that which shall endure throughout His mighty and exalted Kingdom. Blessed is the ear and eye that hath today attained unto the hearing of the Call and the witnessing of His signs. Were a pure and sanctified ear to be found, it would hear from all things the glad-tidings of this Most Great Revelation, and no tidings in the world can equal these tidings. Say: O my God, my God! I find myself in an ocean of joy through my heart being attracted to the signs of Thy Manifestation in Thy days, and I find myself in depths of sorrow by the prolongation of the days of Thine enemy. O Lord! Have mercy upon Thy chosen ones and sincere servants, then protect them from the wolves of Thy earth. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.O servant of God! Every soul hath testified and doth testify to the transience of this world; nevertheless they cling to it in such wise as transcendeth the reckoning of those who reckon. Heedlessness hath deprived all and barred them from the ocean of divine mercy. Blessed is he who possesseth might and who, through the Name of Truth, hath rent asunder the veils and attained unto the horizon of Revelation. Say:O my God, my God! Aid me and Thy loved ones to turn unto Thee and to arise to serve Thee. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. O Lord! Thou seest the ignorant seeking the ocean of Thy knowledge, and the needy seeking the kingdom of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of what is with Thee. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.O servant of God! Verily the birds of the divine throne are caught in the talons of oppression. Today all must fix their gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon and be detached from aught else. Greed and avarice have deprived the people from the mysteries of these days. The fire of lust and desire will not be extinguished save through the Will of God, exalted be His glory. Say:O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy standing and sitting, by Thy Will and Authority, by Thy recitation of verses, by Thy declarations and utterances, and by the manifestation of Thy Cause before Thy creation, to protect Thy loved ones from the evil of the oppressors who have violated Thy Covenant and Testament, and have committed that which hath caused every truthful and trustworthy one to lament, and every knowing and informed one to weep. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.O Ali! Some time ago the petition of Khalil, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, attained the Most Holy Court, and for each of the names mentioned therein, a Tablet and verses were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of glory and bounty, majesty and splendor. Well is it with them and pleasant it is to them. Likewise, specifically for thee and for him who spoke before his Lord was revealed that which is sanctified from doubt and holy above similitude. The loved ones have ever been and continue to be mentioned in the Court of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We hereby give glad tidings at this time to thy son who repeatedly uttered praise of his Lord. We heard his call and whatsoever was manifested from his tongue in praise of the Goal of all the worlds was honored with acceptance and hearing. Blessed is the tongue that spoke in praise of its Lord. His poetry was recited before the Face, and those present, as well as those circumambulating, heard it and each mentioned concerning it that which is the cause of confirmation and the source of success. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the kinsmen, and adorn them with the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Utterance, the Goal of all the worlds.We conclude Our words at this point by mentioning the two names We mentioned before, as a favor from Our presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Inspirer, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We counsel at the end of the Book Our loved ones and friends to trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness, and sincerity. Today the helper of the Cause hath been and is goodly character and pure deeds. Blessed are they that act and happy are they that comprehend.\n\nHis honor the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, has in these days again attained the Most Holy Court and repeatedly made mention of the friends of that land. In truth he has been and continues to be the helper of the friends and loved ones. In the petitions submitted he has made and continues to make mention of the friends in various regions, both past and present. He has been and remains the well-wisher of the world and all peoples. We beseech God to assist him in all conditions, even as He has assisted him. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Light and glory be upon you, O friends of God and His chosen ones. We beseech Him to aid you in whatsoever He loves and is pleased with. There is none other God but He, the Lord of the Most Exalted Horizon, Who has appeared through His Most Glorious Name.\n\n=== END BH00818 ===\n\n=== START BH00820 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful\n\nPraise be to God Who is unique in His majesty, singular in His beauty, sanctified above all utterance, and Who is the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, in the beginning and the end and in all conditions. He has ever been sanctified above the mention of all created things and exalted above the loftiest descriptions of all contingent beings. Through one of His names the ocean of knowledge surged in the world and the Most Great Name spoke amongst the nations. Through His exalted Word the Supreme Horizon appeared and the Sadratu'l-Muntaha spoke between earth and heaven. Exalted be His dominion through which the standards of guidance were raised amidst creation and the banners of power upon the lofty mountains. By His sweetest call all things were attracted, and through His manifestation the Speaker of the Mount spoke from the highest station of Sinai. Exalted, exalted be the appearance of this Light and the revelation of His Cause in this darkness. He is the One through Whom appeared the decisive Word in the final return. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Bestower. And the prayer that shines from the horizon of the heaven of His Cause and the peace that appears from the mouth of His will be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones who sacrificed themselves in His path to manifest His Cause and exalt His Word. They are the ones through whom the mysteries of the Book were revealed and that which was recorded in the scriptures and tablets. Through them the decree of unity was set forth and the light of oneness shone forth, and the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the branches that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Gracious.O Husayn, upon thee be the Glory of God! The letter which Khalil, upon him be My loving-kindness, sent to thee was presented before the face of the Wronged One time and again. Praise be to God, the sweet fragrances of the love of God waft from it. This is from a grace to which the people of hearing, sight and heart bear witness, and beyond them whoever hath spoken and speaketh in every condition that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of him as a favor from Us and give him the glad-tidings of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Generous. We have heard his call and remembered him through this perspicuous Tablet. Blessed be he and those who have arisen to serve the Cause and have said: \"The Promise hath come and the Promised One calleth from the supreme horizon, saying: 'By God! He Who is the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens hath come, through Whom the hidden was revealed, the treasured was manifested, and the Way hath spoken. The All-Glorious hath come and this is His straight path. Indeed, the Guide calleth out and saith:'\"O Khalil, rejoice in thy Lord's loving-kindness. He hath remembered thee on a night wherein sorrows encompassed Him from those who denied God's proof and His evidence, who broke His Covenant, who rejected His Cause, and who disputed His signs whereby every mouldering bone was quickened. We make mention of those whom thou didst mention in thy letter and give them the glad-tidings of God's grace and mercy, and We counsel them with that through which the lights of justice may appear in the world. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Counselor, the Compassionate, the Generous. O My loved ones in that land! Beware lest the conditions of oppression frighten you. Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom, placing your trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Commanding. Those who desired to extinguish the light of God are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O heedless ones! Where are your fathers and your ancestors? Where are earth's tyrants and its pharaohs? Where are the caesars of the kingdom with their ornaments and their palaces? Take heed and be not of the heedless. Where are those who turned away from God and His signs, who denied God's favor after its revelation, and who committed in their fleeting days that which caused the dwellers of the pavilions of the Kingdom to lament? God seized them with a mighty grip from His presence. Verily, He is the Seizer, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nRejoice, O My loved ones, in My remembrance of you! By the life of God, it cannot be equaled by all the treasures and riches of the earth - to this beareth witness He with Whom is the Clear Book. Take ye the chalice of salvation in the name of your Lord, the Subduer of the winds, then drink therefrom in defiance of those who denied Him Who came unto them with verses that cannot be equaled by the books of old - to this doth testify the Tongue of Grandeur in this exalted station.Today the proof itself calleth aloud, and all evidence summoneth mankind to a Cause the like of which, from the beginning of creation until now, hath never appeared. Such is the heedlessness of the people that they have turned away from Him Who hath brought verses that equal all divine books past and future, and have occupied themselves with souls who are not worthy of mention. Reflect now upon that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an, where He clearly saith: \"And there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth shall swoon away, save those whom God shall please to exempt. Then shall there be another blast on it, and lo! they shall rise and gaze around them. And the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book shall be set, and the Prophets shall be brought up, and the witnesses; and judgment shall be given between them with truth, and they shall not be wronged.\"Today all are seen to have swooned away save a few letters of the countenance of God, the Most High, the Most Great. The steadfast souls who remain firm today are as pearls in the ocean of existence - their station cannot be completed by pen and ink. God shall soon make manifest that which was hidden in His assured knowledge. Reflect upon these two verses of the Qur'an - the oceans of knowledge and recognition concealed in the first and second trumpet blasts, and likewise upon the second verse which is a mighty sign. Though today it is fully manifest and evident, the heedless people remain unaware of it.Ask ye God to cleanse the eyes of men from the dust of desire, that they might perceive that for which they were created. The verses are manifest and the evidence clear - that which was never before seen or comprehended hath in this Most Great Revelation been witnessed and heard without veil or concealment, explicitly and without interpretation. The divine trumpet soundeth amidst humanity, yet none is aware to hear it, all being intoxicated with the wine of desire. Soon shall the world and all that is therein which they now behold return to nothingness, and they shall find themselves in manifest loss.O friends! Know ye the value of these days. In all ages and centuries the pharaohs of the earth and tyrants of every land have objected to the truth and have striven with utmost effort and endeavor to extinguish the fire of the divine Tree and to quench the light of divine oneness. But God drove them away through His power and manifested what He desired through His all-compelling sovereignty over His servants. The foremost tyrants are the ignorant ones of the earth who are known for their learning. These are the ones who cut off the ways of God and His path. The guilt of all the people of the world can be traced to these souls, for they are the cause of prevention and the reason for denial. May God protect us and you from the evil of these people.We counsel all to fear God and to be righteous, to be patient and steadfast, and to preserve the verses and words of God lest they be touched by the idolaters. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon My loved ones there who have attained unto the verses of the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm, the Possessor of Glory and Might.O Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! Send thou this Most Great, Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Exalted Tablet to His Honor Khalil, that his eyes might be solaced thereby, and the eyes of those who have not differed regarding this momentous Announcement.

Speak, and hold not thy peace. The day star of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of Our name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the kingdom of the name of God hath been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Arise before the nations of the earth, and arm thyself with the power of this Most Great Name, and be not of those who tarry.Methinks that thou hast halted and movest not upon My Tablet. Could the brightness of the Divine Countenance have bewildered thee, or the idle talk of the froward filled thee with grief and paralyzed thy movement? Take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this Day - the Day whereon the Finger of majesty and power hath opened the seal of the Wine of Reunion, and called all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. Preferrest thou to tarry when the breeze announcing the Day of God hath already breathed over thee, or art thou of them that are shut out as by a veil from Him?No veil whatever have I allowed, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, to shut me from the recognition of the glories of Thy Day - the Day which is the lamp of guidance unto the whole world, and the sign of the Ancient of Days unto all them that dwell therein. My silence is by reason of the veils that have blinded Thy creatures' eyes to Thee, and my muteness is because of the impediments that have hindered Thy people from recognizing Thy truth. Thou knowest what is in me, but I know not what is in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.By Thy name that excelleth all other names! If Thy overruling and all-compelling behest should ever reach me, it would empower me to revive the souls of all men, through Thy most exalted Word, which I have heard uttered by Thy Tongue of power in Thy Kingdom of glory. It would enable me to announce the revelation of Thy effulgent countenance wherethrough that which lay hidden from the eyes of men hath been manifested in Thy name, the Perspicuous, the sovereign Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Canst thou discover any one but Me, O Pen, in this Day? What hath become of the creation and the manifestations thereof? What of the names and their kingdom? Whither are gone all created things, whether seen or unseen? What of the hidden secrets of the universe and its revelations? Lo, the entire creation hath passed away! Nothing remaineth except My Face, the Ever-Abiding, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious.\n\nThis is the Day whereon naught can be seen except the splendors of the Light that shineth from the face of Thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most Bountiful. Verily, We have caused every soul to expire by virtue of Our irresistible and all-subduing sovereignty. We have, then, called into being a new creation, as a token of Our grace unto men. I am, verily, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out: \"Great is thy blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been made the foot-stool of thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne.\" The realm of glory exclaimeth: \"Would that my life could be sacrificed for thee, for He Who is the Beloved of the All-Merciful hath established His sovereignty upon thee, through the power of His Name that hath been promised unto all things, whether of the past or of the future.\"This is the Day whereon every sweet smelling thing hath derived its fragrance from the smell of My garment - a garment that hath shed its perfume upon the whole creation. This is the Day whereon the rushing waters of everlasting life have gushed out of the Will of the All-Merciful. Haste ye, with your hearts and souls, and quaff your fill, O Concourse of the realms above!Say: He it is Who is the Manifestation of Him Who is the Unknowable, the Invisible of the Invisibles, could ye but perceive it. He it is Who hath laid bare before you the hidden and treasured Gem, were ye to seek it. He it is Who is the one Beloved of all things, whether of the past or of the future. Would that ye might set your hearts and hopes upon Him!We have heard the voice of thy pleading, O Pen, and excuse thy silence. What is it that hath so sorely bewildered thee? The inebriation of Thy presence, O Well-Beloved of all worlds, hath seized and possessed me.Arise, and proclaim unto the entire creation the tidings that He Who is the All-Merciful hath directed His steps towards the Ridvan and entered it. Guide, then, the people unto the garden of delight which God hath made the Throne of His Paradise. We have chosen thee to be our most mighty Trumpet, whose blast is to signalize the resurrection of all mankind.\n\nSay: This is the Paradise on whose foliage the wine of utterance hath imprinted the testimony: \"He that was hidden from the eyes of men is revealed, girded with sovereignty and power!\" This is the Paradise, the rustling of whose leaves proclaims: \"O ye that inhabit the heavens and the earth! There hath appeared what hath never previously appeared. He Who, from everlasting, had concealed His Face from the sight of creation is now come.\" From the whispering breeze that wafteth amidst its branches there cometh the cry: \"He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is made manifest. The Kingdom is God's,\" while from its streaming waters can be heard the murmur: \"All eyes are gladdened, for He Whom none hath beheld, Whose secret no one hath discovered, hath lifted the veil of glory, and uncovered the countenance of Beauty.\"Within this Paradise, and from the heights of its loftiest chambers, the Maids of Heaven have cried out and shouted: \"Rejoice, ye dwellers of the realms above, for the fingers of Him Who is the Ancient of Days are ringing, in the name of the All-Glorious, the Most Great Bell, in the midmost heart of the heavens. The hands of bounty have borne round the cup of everlasting life. Approach, and quaff your fill. Drink with healthy relish, O ye that are the very incarnations of longing, ye who are the embodiments of vehement desire!\"This is the Day whereon He Who is the Revealer of the names of God hath stepped out of the Tabernacle of glory, and proclaimed unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth: \"Put away the cups of Paradise and all the life-giving waters they contain, for lo, the people of Baha have entered the blissful abode of the Divine Presence, and quaffed the wine of reunion, from the chalice of the beauty of their Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most High.\"Forget the world of creation, O Pen, and turn thou towards the face of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. Adorn, then, the world with the ornament of the favors of thy Lord, the King of everlasting days. For We perceive the fragrance of the Day whereon He Who is the Desire of all nations hath shed upon the kingdoms of the unseen and of the seen the splendor of the light of His most excellent names, and enveloped them with the radiance of the luminaries of His most gracious favors - favors which none can reckon except Him, Who is the omnipotent Protector of the entire creation.\n\nLook not upon the creatures of God except with the eye of kindliness and of mercy, for Our loving providence hath pervaded all created things, and Our grace encompassed the earth and the heavens. This is the Day whereon the true servants of God partake of the life-giving waters of reunion, the Day whereon those that are nigh unto Him are able to drink of the soft-flowing river of immortality, and they who believe in His unity, the wine of His Presence, through their recognition of Him Who is the Highest and Last End of all, in Whom the Tongue of Majesty and Glory voiceth the call: \"The Kingdom is Mine. I, Myself, am, of Mine own right, its Ruler.\" Attract the hearts of men, through the call of Him, the one alone Beloved. Say: This is the Voice of God, if ye do but hearken. This is the Day Spring of the Revelation of God, did ye but know it. This is the Dawning-Place of the Cause of God, were ye to recognize it. This is the Source of the commandment of God, did ye but judge it fairly. This is the manifest and hidden Secret; would that ye might perceive it. O peoples of the world! Cast away, in My name that transcendeth all other names, the things ye possess, and immerse yourselves in this Ocean in whose depths lay hidden the pearls of wisdom and of utterance, an ocean that surgeth in My name, the All-Merciful. Thus instructeth you He with Whom is the Mother Book. The Best-Beloved is come. In His right hand is the sealed Wine of His name. Happy is the man that turneth unto Him, and drinketh his fill, and exclaimeth: \"Praise be to Thee, O Revealer of the signs of God!\" By the righteousness of the Almighty! Every hidden thing hath been manifested through the power of truth. All the favors of God have been sent down, as a token of His grace. The waters of everlasting life have, in their fullness, been proffered unto men. Every single cup hath been borne round by the hand of the Well-Beloved. Draw near, and tarry not, though it be for one short moment.\n\nBlessed are they that have soared on the wings of detachment and attained the station which, as ordained by God, overshadoweth the entire creation, whom neither the vain imaginations of the learned, nor the multitude of the hosts of the earth have succeeded in deflecting from His Cause. Who is there among you, O people, who will renounce the world, and draw nigh unto God, the Lord of all names? Where is he to be found who, through the power of My name that transcendeth all created things, will cast away the things that men possess, and cling, with all his might, to the things which God, the Knower of the unseen and of the seen, hath bidden him observe? Thus hath His bounty been sent down unto men, His testimony fulfilled, and His proof shone forth above the Horizon of mercy. Rich is the prize that shall be won by him who hath believed and exclaimed: \"Lauded art Thou, O Beloved of all worlds! Magnified be Thy name, O Thou the Desire of every understanding heart!\"Rejoice with exceeding gladness, O people of Baha, as ye call to remembrance the Day of supreme felicity, the Day whereon the Tongue of the Ancient of Days hath spoken, as He departed from His House, proceeding to the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of His name, the All-Merciful.God is Our witness. Were We to reveal the hidden secrets of that Day, all they that dwell on earth and in the heavens would swoon away and die, except such as will be preserved by God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.Such is the inebriating effect of the words of God upon Him Who is the Revealer of His undoubted proofs, that His Pen can move no longer. With these words He concludeth His Tablet: \"No God is there but Me, the Most Exalted, the Most Powerful, the Most Excellent, the All-Knowing.\"\n\n=== END BH00821 ===\n\n=== START BH00822 ===\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Great, the Great! These are the verses of God, the King, the Truth, the Just, the Manifest, which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of mighty grace. Verily they are the proof of God amongst His creation and His testimony amongst all created things. And verily they are a revelation from One Who is Mighty, All-Knowing. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not every ignorant doubter. Follow Him Who desireth naught for you save to draw you nigh unto the court of nearness, the station wherein are raised the melodies of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\n\nVerily thou, O thou who gazest towards the direction of the Cause, hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from the precincts of the Prison, this Spot wherein the Youth hath been imprisoned through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. There is no God but Him; within His grasp lies the dominion of Command and Creation. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Blessed art thou for having been enkindled by the fire of the love of God and for having turned thy heart towards the direction of His mighty House. Arise to champion the Cause of God and His love, and tarry not for a moment. Convey unto the people that which the Spirit hath cast upon thy heart, and be not of them that are silent. Should anyone question thee about this Youth, say: By God, He is the Announcement of God in the Tablets of Command, and His Beauty hath been made manifest in truth with great sovereignty. Verily, He is the Most Exalted Who hath come unto you with the signs of your Lord, were ye but to know. He hath sacrificed His spirit in the path of God that He might bring you nigh unto the seat of a mighty throne. Beware, O people, lest ye reject the truth by that which ye possess, for that which ye possess, even if it be founded on truth, hath been sent down from Our presence and ordained from Our court, were ye but to know. Inhale ye the fragrance of whatsoever appeareth from Him; should ye perceive the fragrance of the Beloved, fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. O people! Wrong not Him against Whom all the peoples of the earth have banded together. O people! If ye deny these verses, then by what evidence have ye believed in 'Ali aforetime and in God's signs in the age of the Messengers? Stand firm in the Cause, then proclaim unto the people this Most Great, this Mighty Announcement. Gather My loved ones unto the law of My love - this is My command unto thee. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded, and be not of the patient ones. Open thy tongue in utterance to celebrate thy Lord, the Most Merciful, that Our slumbering servants might arise at thy mention. Say: O people! The Most Great Ocean hath appeared, the Lamp of the Cause hath been lit, and the Sun of eternity hath shone forth from the horizon of this luminous dawn. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of its lights, for they that deprive themselves are indeed a wicked and most lost people. Say: O people! If ye desire to hear the melodies of God, hearken unto that which hath been inscribed in this Preserved Tablet, and if ye wish to ascend unto the heights of nearness, read ye what hath been revealed therein, and be not of them that are silent. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and commit not what was committed by those who preceded you and who denied the signs of God and His Messengers, until the earth was dyed with their blood, and for this were they cursed in this world and the next, and were among the idolaters. Take thou the cup which hath appeared in the form of the Word and hath been filled with the Kawthar of thy Lord's knowledge, the Most High, the Most Great. Then drink thereof in My Name and pass it among the concourse of lovers, that all may be attracted by this wondrous, this mighty Kawthar. Whosoever drinketh but a drop thereof shall never die, but shall endure as long as his Lord, the Mighty, the Eternal, the All-Wise, endureth. Thus hath this Prisoner counseled thee that thou mightest aid Him in truth and be among them that stand firm in this Cause, at which all who are in the heavens and on earth have trembled, save those who have detached themselves from all things and have turned towards this glorious, this resplendent Direction.\n\nMention from Us unto him who hath been named Kazim, that he may call to mind the remembrance of God his Lord and aid Him through utterance. This is what hath been ordained for every soul in this Revelation from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Blessed be thy father in that he attained the presence of God and remained with the Beloved until he sacrificed himself in the path of God, the Best-Beloved of the worlds. We loved him in such wise as cannot be mentioned in words. Blessed be he and his days and all that pertaineth unto him. He is now in the Supreme Horizon with his Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, were ye of them that know. And thou, O servant, walk thou in his footsteps. Thus have We counseled thee before, and now as a command from God thy Lord. Verily He knoweth all things, and naught escapeth His knowledge. With Him is the knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and earth, and He hath power over all things.Then glorify from Us him who hath been named Ibrahim, that he may behold the kingdom of the heavens and earth and be of them that are assured. Follow thou the way of the Friend in thy love for this Youth. Say: O people, make Him your merchandise and sell Him not for dirhams and dinars. Arise to serve God and aid Him, and say: O people, abandon that which your selves and desires command you. Then take hold of God's laws with strength from Us and be not of the heedless.Then glorify from Us the countenance of her who was with thee and give her glad tidings from this Youth Who hath been imprisoned in the path of God, the Just Sovereign, the Mighty, the Wise. We desire that the people of that house be united and as one soul. Thus doth this Wronged One command you out of His love for you, were ye of them that know. Cast aside differences, then unite in My love, My remembrance and My praise, for this is better for you than all that hath been created in the heavens and earths.Then glorify from Us the countenance of her whose companion was martyred in God's path and ascended to the Supreme Horizon in the vicinity of the mercy of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Though he committed that which was forbidden, yet God forgave him and the breezes of pardon wafted upon him, cleansing him of transgression and causing him to dwell in His paradise, the Mighty, the Wondrous.O Ali, deliver the messages of thy Lord and be not of them that fear. It behooveth His loved ones to detach themselves from all else but God and to arise in His Cause in such wise that the clamor of the oppressors shall not deter them. Whenever trials descend from the clouds of tribulation, they are in the utmost joy and delight, for the sun of utterance hath shone upon them from this luminous and radiant horizon. Say: Today, should one detach himself from all who are in the heavens and earth and turn with his heart toward the Holy Court, he would subdue all created things through one of the names of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: The Sun hath dawned with such splendor as hath never appeared in former ages. Be illumined, O people, by its lights and be not of the patient ones. Say: Have mercy on yourselves and deprive not your souls of the fragrances of these days, and be not of them that are brought low. Fear God, then recognize the worth of that which hath been sent down to you from the clouds of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Turn to Him with a pure and luminous heart. Thus have We imparted unto thee the truth, that thou mayest impart unto the people that which the Spirit hath cast into thy breast, that perchance they may arise from the slumber of heedlessness and desire, and draw near unto God Who created them and created all things, and be of them that attain. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the power of the Friend, who at this moment declareth: Praise be to God, the Goal of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00822 ===\n\n=== START BH00823 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!Praise be to the One Who is the Goal of all, Who created the world through His Word and nurtured it through various means. The law of causation is firmly established, and the manifestation of all things occurs through definite and determined means. Exalted be His Command and His Greatness! For every matter there is an appointed time and a destined cause. Through contemplation of this station and observation of this utterance, one attains to the light of the Divine Sun of Justice. Divine decrees are contingent upon means, and these means and causes have been and continue to be the education of His servants. We beseech the Truth to assist these servants to achieve that which leads to progress and elevation. Verily, He is the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.And prayers and peace be upon Him Whom the Tongue of Eternity and the Lord of Nations praised in the world: \"But for Thee, I would not have created the celestial spheres.\" Glory be to our Lord! With one step He transcended the earth and reached the heavens, nay, beyond the heavens, nay, beyond justice and comprehension. Exalted be His power and magnificent His sovereignty! And upon His family and companions, whom God made the letters of His Psalms, the words of His Books, the manifestations of His Will, the dawning-places of His Purpose, and the sources of His justice and command - prayers sanctified from beginning and end. The command belongs to God, the Lord of the Last and the First.Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived, bearing good tidings and spreading blessed banners, for it was adorned with the mention of God, exalted be His Glory. Without His mention, all mentions are meaningless, and without His remembrance, one can dispense with the remembrance of the world. In truth, the freshness, grace, and glory of the cities of unity and detachment have been and will ever be through His mention and praise. We hope these servants will not be deprived of this life-giving station.After reading, contemplating, and reflecting, we approached the station and presented it. The Beloved, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, says:O Abdullah! Upon thee be My peace and My loving-kindness! God willing, mayest thou be blessed with divine favors and illumined and adorned with the light of God's love. May such a sweet fragrance be diffused from the deeds of thyself and the friends of that land that perhaps the manifestations of religion and trustworthiness in that land may transform the grief coming from other directions. Today, deeds are necessary, especially deeds from which the fragrance of service and trustworthiness emanates. The affairs of the Threshold have descended like swords upon the temple of trustworthiness, truthfulness, and purity. Say:My God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy loved ones with the crown of trustworthiness and detachment, their temples with the ornament of justice and righteousness, and their hearts with the raiment of unity and harmony. I beseech Thee, O my God and the God of the Kingdom of Names, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will exalt them among Thy creation and cause them to be adorned with Thy virtues, whereby the horizons of Thy servants' and creatures' existence may be illumined. Verily, Thou art the Generous One, possessed of great bounty and supreme mercy. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.We make mention of the loved ones and ask for each honor, blessing, and exaltation. However, that which has been and continues to be the cause of elevation, ascendancy, and the manifestation of the stations of existence is unity. To this testify the Supreme Concourse, the Most Exalted Pen, the Most Exalted Paradise, the Supreme Heaven, the Most Sublime Word, and the Divine Lote-Tree.\n\nPraise be to God! The outpourings of the Pen of Providence have seized and quickened the world, especially His loved ones. No seeker hath been deprived, and no aspirant forbidden. From His Ocean of mercy, I beseech and implore that He deprive none of the inhabitants of earth from this heavenly News and eternal Cause. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.Concerning what was mentioned about his honor Darvish Niyaz, may God strengthen him, it brought joy, and this evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist him in mention, praise and service to His Cause, and to unveil that which leads to elevation and advancement. When mention of his honor was made in the presence of the Master, He said:\"O Niyaz! Upon thee be the peace of the All-Bountiful! It is intended that the Tree send unto thee its wondrous, sublime and gathered fruits, and the Pen desireth to manifest its hidden pearls and send them as a gift, that thou mayest remember the time of attaining His presence. We beseech God in all conditions to enable thee to witness and hearken with thine own sight and hearing, detached from the sight of the world and the ears of the nations, and to assist thee in such wise that thou mayest take the most exalted cup before the faces of humanity and drink therefrom in His Name, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\" End.This servant also conveys greetings to him and beseeches from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever is befitting. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.Another matter: From his honor Aqa Khan, may God the Exalted strengthen him, petitions were received, and there was also a letter addressed to you which was given to his honor the Most Great Name, upon him be God's peace and favors, and placed in this servant's envelope in His presence. Search for it; perhaps it may be found there. However, the aforementioned Khan's situation has not yet become clear. In every gathering he has denied this Cause, yet he has mentioned words similar to the mentions he made in this land, from which the fragrance of irreligion wafts. This time a Tablet was specifically sent to him. It is hoped that he may attain to that which he himself had previously written, appear with a single face, and be illumined. In any case, we are not without hope. God's grace is abundant; perhaps it may encompass him. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.Concerning the mention made of his honor Haji Ali Akbar, upon him be God's peace, after it was presented before the Master's face, He said:\"He is the Remembering, the Helper. The Wronged One desireth to make mention of him who was named Ali, before Akbar, that the mention may attract him to God, the Lord of lords. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to adorn him with the ornament of goodly character and assist him in that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him and the Desire of those in the heavens and the earth. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having enabled thee to turn unto Him and made thee of the party of unity amidst the parties. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord and my Support, for having sent down unto me from the heaven of Thy bounty the blessing of Thy recognition. I beseech Thee to enable me to achieve what Thou hast chosen for me in Thy Book. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I hold fast to the cord of Thy grace and seek refuge at Thy threshold. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThis servant supplicates success on their behalf and implores his Lord to acquaint him with that which will profit him in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Wise. All the loved ones in that land are remembered and, praise be to God, have attained His grace. We beseech God, our Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth, to aid them to achieve that whereby their stations may be exalted in His presence and to ordain for them the reward of those who are nigh and sincere. Verily He is the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Uniqueness befitteth Him and peerlessness is the station of His loved ones, how much more His own Essence, exalted be He - nothing can be likened unto His likeness. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Light and radiance, glory and splendor be upon the Hands of His Cause, who broke not His covenant and disputed not His verses, who responded when they heard and turned towards Him when the people were in manifest rejection. We beseech God to guide all to the horizon of His grace and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is powerful over all things.O beloved of my heart! The letters sent from the city of Qaf arrived one after another like the spring rain. Praise be to God, each of these letters was a clear book mentioning the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and earth. After their perusal and reading, they were presented before the presence of the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His glory and mighty be His utterance:O Amin! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to the Purpose of the world Who granted thee success in serving His Cause and confirmed thee in that which its mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. All that thou didst mention regarding the friends was heard. We beseech God to enable all to achieve the most great steadfastness, such that neither ranks and multitudes nor the means and colors of the world shall prevent them from the straight path. Say: O people of the earth! This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. Cast away what ye possess and take what ye are commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Amin! From the beginning of days until now thou hast stood firm in service, held fast to the hem of trustworthiness, and clung to the cord of steadfastness. This is from the bounties of the Day of God which have encompassed thee. The affairs of God are entrusted to thee. That which hath appeared from thee in service to the Cause thus far hath been attested to by the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. We beseech God to enable all to achieve that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause.He who standeth in service hath indeed been blessed with special favors. The Tongue of Grandeur in the most exalted station beareth witness to his service and his turning unto God. What thou didst mention regarding him is the truth, no doubt therein. Divine success and confirmation are present at his right hand and his left. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt him through His Name, to assist him with His hosts, and to strengthen him through His bounty. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.O Amin! In all conditions, keep thy gaze fixed upon God and His attributes. The purpose is that all should be pleased with thee. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified concerning thee to that which causeth the exaltation of the Word of God. However, following the example of God, exalted be His glory, in all conditions is beloved, especially for thee who art associated with Him, mentioned through Him, and known by Him. The fragrance of thy character should be so diffused that no one would find cause for discussion. Verily, He hath aided thee and will aid thee and will be with thee, and He is the Compassionate, the Trustworthy.\n\nWe behold the friends of that land with loving-kindness, remember them with grace, and turn to them with love. Praise be to God, they are engaged in service and illumined with the light of recognition. Soon shall they witness the rewards of their deeds and what God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, hath ordained for them. Due to the arrival of the Most Great Branch and the coming and going of the friends, the response to Jamal and 'Ali-Akbar - upon them be My glory and loving-kindness - was delayed. God willing, they shall attain hereafter to what is befitting. Give them glad tidings, and to My friends, from God, the Bestower, the Generous.Praise be to God, the grace and loving-kindness of the True One, exalted be His glory, hath ever been and continueth to be directed towards His servants. The sincere ones and those drawn nigh, by the testimony of God - exalted be His glory - are present before the Seat of Justice. Happy are they!Regarding what you wrote about Gholam - upon him be the glory of the All-Merciful - having allocated funds to be delivered over four months by him who serveth the Cause - upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness - they commanded that two months thereof be \\[delivered\\] to the teachers - upon them be the glory of God, His loving-kindness and His mercy. O Trustee! Those assured souls must be considered until God openeth before their faces the gates of His blessings. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing.It is submitted that in the Most Holy Presence, unless funds are needed they are not accepted. For some time no funds reached this land until a debt of three hundred liras accumulated, hence those funds were allocated. Yesterday the Name of Bounty - upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness - arrived and mentioned the receipt of the allocated funds. Regarding the purchase of land in Haifa previously mentioned, most of the shares from various places, namely Egypt, Port Said, Beirut and Akka, were, according to instructions, returned to their owners since no land was found to purchase. The manager of this matter was our Master, His Holiness the Blessed Branch, Aqa Mirza Badi'u'llah - may my spirit be a sacrifice for his coming - therefore whatever they deemed appropriate was done and the remainder is being returned these days. After the arrival of your beloved letter, the command was again issued to proceed to that land for some days that if found, they may purchase it in your name. This is from God's grace upon you and upon the sincere ones and those drawn nigh among His servants.As for the Leaf - upon her be the glory of God - after submission to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, they commanded that these matters and affairs pertaining to rights revert to you. Thus it hath ever been and God willing shall continue to be. If she seeketh to attain the presence, you should make arrangements and send her. If she proceedeth with 'Ali-Akbar it is acceptable, as he originally mentioned this matter, or with another person who meets with his approval. You should be engaged in the refinement of souls and the exaltation of the Word in all regions with perfect detachment. We beseech God to assist you, to aid you, and through you to raise the standards of His acceptable \\[virtues\\] among His servants. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nOther matters will be sent later, God willing. Five Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets along with papers have been received and sent. God willing, may they reach their owners. I have been and am remembering all the friends, and I beseech God for His grace and bounty towards all. Verily He is \\[the Mighty, the Powerful\\].

He is the Omnipotent One Whom multitudes and hosts cannot turn back from His will. With one word He raised high the banner of divine unity, and caused the lights of the Sun of Truth to shine upon all peoples. The bearer of that Most Great Standard was the Primal Mirror, the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. Through Him He made manifest the pearls of the ocean of knowledge and displayed them before the eyes of true money-changers. Exalted, exalted be His station, and exalted, exalted be His power and sovereignty! Through Him He revealed that which was concealed and brought to the realm of visibility that which had been forever hidden and treasured. Through His perfect might He conquered the cities outward and inward and opened the sealed gates. He is the Mirror of \"He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\" He is the Source of every manifestation and appearance, and the Seal thereof. Worthy is He of mention and praise, and of blessings and peace from God, the Lord of Names, and upon His family and companions through whom every seeker attained and every denier was lost, through whom every throne and seat and every lofty chair was established. The servant beseecheth his Lord by their humility and submission, their lights and their spending, their martyrdom and their steadfastness and their nearness, that He may raise up what hath been cast down, and take up what hath fallen, and restore what hath been destroyed of His mighty throne. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth.May my spirit be a sacrifice for your imprisonment and your exile! Your gracious letter, like the morning breeze, awakened this one sleeping in the valley of heedlessness. After inhaling its fragrance it was presented before the Master, Who showed such favor that this servant is incapable of describing it. Verily, the servant, in the nights and days, beseecheth God on your behalf that He may grant you success and aid you and bestow upon you that whereby your mention may be exalted. For these are days wherein man is capable of attaining lofty stations. Those souls who desire naught in the world save righteousness, and who in the nights and days have summoned all to unity and concord and justice and fairness - nevertheless in every year the oppressors of the age have stretched forth the hand of tyranny and have done that which hath caused and doth cause grief to pure and tranquil hearts. Is the persecution of the oppressed ones of the earth a sign of valor and prowess and knowledge and wisdom? Nay, by God! Would that they had endeavored to reclaim their lost territories or to transform their abasement into glory! At every moment they draw nearer to the nethermost depths, yet they perceive it not. They are mounted upon the steeds of passion and desire, galloping through the wilderness of pride. By the life of God! Soon shall they behold themselves in grievous torment. In any case, this servant, with the utmost supplication, beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant justice to all and to adorn them with the ornament of equity. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nConcerning what was written about the delay in responding to the honored letters, His Holiness is correct. This matter of correspondence which was written brings joy, happiness and delight to this company through the favors that are directed from that quarter. After presenting this matter, they said: \"By My life, he has spoken truly, for love is the sweet water of mercy for the friends, the ocean of grace for the thirsty, the light of knowledge for the seekers, everlasting life for the sincere ones, the spray of the ocean of reunion for the longing ones, and the melody of the bird of faithfulness - nay rather, the rapturous song of nearness and meeting - for the lovers.\" What was written is correct. The Branches and the Servant should not be remiss in sending replies, even though the sorrows that have come and the successive afflictions prevent one from necessary matters. However, in view of giving each one their due right, they must act in ways that bring joy, happiness and delight to the hearts of the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory. We send greetings upon him and upon those with him, young and old, female and male, and We beseech God the Exalted to confirm them in what befits them. Verily, He has power over all things.From the other blessed passages, the degrees of kindness and favor are clear and evident. Translation is not necessary, but the Exalted Truth bears witness that though outwardly there may be delay, you are ever remembered in the heart and present before the face. God suffices as witness to this. The people of the pavilion of glory have shown and continue to show favor to that beloved one and the honored ladies. Praise be to God, you are remembered and have attained to His favor. The Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of His most pure footsteps - has not been present for some time. If your letter reaches Him, He will certainly bestow a gracious reply. This ephemeral one submits that I convey greetings to each of the beloved ones, and I beseech from the Exalted Truth the good of this world and the next for each one. Likewise, I convey holy greetings beyond count or measure to the honored ladies, and I beseech God to adorn all with His special favors and to grant success in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.As for what was written concerning the cherished one, his honor Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Akbar - may God the Exalted assist him - they said that in all circumstances he must be occupied with some task. God willing, divine assistance will reach him. Due to events in the Land of Ta \\[Tehran\\], namely the imprisonment of His honor the beloved Haji Siyyid 'Ali-Akbar - upon him be God's peace - some of the mischief-makers have had thoughts and made certain mentions, and from what is known, they are somewhat intent upon their aims, until God wills what He wills.\n\nAnother submission is that when the honored Mirza Ali-Akbar was present, he mentioned certain trees which could be sent from that land, including a special variety of wild rose that exists in that region and would be sent. The details of this matter are that with great difficulty they were sent from two locations in Iran - from Tabriz and Shiraz - but neither arrived. Therefore Mirza Ali-Akbar mentioned that it is found specifically there and would be sent. He also mentioned the Aghalib-Tus tree which they plant and grow for changing the air, as well as Indian oranges and certain other trees and flowers. Now, whatever is pleasing and beloved in your sight, and possible to send for planting in the small plot, they will surely accept the trouble and send it. May perpetual, illuminating, manifest and brilliant peace from the heaven of providence be upon your honor and upon them all, male and female, and upon those who speak with pure truth and act according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, Lord of all the worlds. The Servant. On 17 Jamadi'th-Thani 1301.\n\n=== END BH00825 ===\n\n=== START BH00826 ===\n\nOn the 22nd of Sha'ban of the year 99O honored Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be 66 9 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most GloriousPraise, sanctified from letters and words, befitteth the King of Reality, Who hath adorned one of His primary manifestations with the ornament \"He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden.\" His is the praise and His is the glory. There is no God but Him and no goal but Him. And blessing and peace and glory and splendor be upon those who have arisen to serve the Cause and have acted in a manner befitting the days of God, the Mighty, the Wise.And now, the letters of that beloved one which arrived previously were each answered, and for each of the mentioned names a wondrous and exalted Tablet was revealed. However, wisdom dictated a delay in sending them, as the heedless ignorant ones in this land have spoken somewhat as befitteth them. God willing, they shall be sent. Today, which is the 22nd of the honored month of Sha'ban, that beloved one's handwritten letter dated the 12th of Rajab caused joy and delight. Praise be to God, the bird of love is in flight, the pen of affection is in motion, and the ink of unity is flowing. Praise be to Him, again praise be to Him, and thanks be to your honor. And all that was written therein was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. The tongue of the favor of the Goal of all the worlds spoke these words, exalted be His glory:\"O Asad! My Pen exalteth thee and My Tongue blesseth thee. God willing, thou shalt be assisted in all matters. Whoso is for God, God is for him. This is a commanding and penetrating word, and hath ever been so. Assuredly, whatsoever the Hand of Divine favor hath deposited in good soil shall grow green and flourish with new effect and mighty fruit. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who is with thee, and blessed are they whose very beings are stirred with longing for the meeting with God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We, verily, glorify thee from this station, and We glorify My loved ones and give them glad tidings of the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds.\" End quote.The answer to this letter is brief, as by command it must be sent at this time so that the trust that was with it may quickly reach that beloved one. God willing, affairs have been and are proceeding well. In truth, that beloved one has arisen to serve the Cause with the utmost effort and endeavor. This servant beseecheth his Lord in humility and supplication to make your honor a standard in His Cause and a banner of His name in His lands. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The envelope sent attained the honor of presence and attention.They said that at present it is not advisable to send any utterance, mention, or tablet specifically from this place. If your honor deems it appropriate and sends something, there is and shall be no harm in it. End quote.Furthermore, you must consider all aspects, for if this matter becomes known and some become aware of what has occurred, they will take action, and that person will surely hesitate in showing love, as he has not attained maturity and has other stations in view. For this reason, they express what they have expressed. A hundred thousand thanks to the Beloved of the worlds Who has enabled that beloved one to achieve these mighty matters. How pleasant and delightful for your honor!Regarding the gift you wrote about, this matter was presented. They said it is not permissible at present, as some do not and have not understood the reality and will interpret it in inappropriate ways. End quote.\n\nIf capacity becomes evident and the time arrives, that he should become the recipient of a Divine Tablet would be most excellent, and this would be a befitting gift for the Mahdi and Messenger, exalted be His grandeur; or if passages, that is, writings of the Most Great Branch (may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps) were to be sent, that too would be beloved for him. Today the Covenant of God is more fitting than all things - meaning that if they harbor no ill intent and continue to show the same degree of protection they have thus far demonstrated, there can be revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning him that which would give assurance that henceforth the people of truth would never fall short in supporting and being loyal to his government, and likewise that God, exalted be His glory, would assist him in executing justice, which is the greatest means for the tranquility of the world and the firm foundation for the edifice of government. Otherwise, they should act according to whatever becomes manifest from them.\n\nMention had been made of Jinab-i-Sayyah, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God that he was assisted in that which would cause his remembrance to endure in the divine Kingdom. He has ever been and continues to be before this ephemeral one's sight. He has always sought to render some service to this Cause. No doubt he has recounted the details of his circumstances. May he be confirmed and assisted in that which is the cause of the manifestation of grace and the source of tranquility and repose for the world. Some time ago Jinab-i-Mirza Maqsud arrived in this land and attained the presence. Previously when he was in Iraq, a petition from him reached the Most Holy Court, an answer was revealed and sent. Afterwards, according to what was mentioned, he tarried and proceeded along his former path, for according to his own account, he had specifically entered various religions to investigate them. This year when he turned towards this land and attained the honor of presence, the utmost kindness and favor was shown to him. However, no word was spoken that was contrary to wisdom, as they have observed in the letter this servant wrote to him. Whatever divine utterances this servant saw regarding world order, the progress of nations, the manifestation of humanity, and the appearance of justice were mentioned. And he himself claimed certitude and knowledge, but this servant dealt with him only to the extent mentioned. In any case, the utmost love was shown regarding him. It is hoped that henceforth he will hold fast to wisdom and drink from the fountain of steadfastness. However, some of the emigrants who had seen him on his path mentioned a word that was contrary to wisdom. This ephemeral one was greatly surprised, and that word was attributed to the Source. That word was a glad-tiding regarding His Holiness Z. Although this word is good, since the purpose is to manifest truth and sincerity, it is submitted that the True One, exalted be His glory, did not utter such a word. In any case, that honored one and this servant beseech the True One not to deprive him, that is, the aforementioned Mirza, from the effulgences of the Sun of favor. Although now the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, are observed regarding His Holiness Z, and surely universal fruits will result from this favor if they are assisted to be steadfast in what they have declared. Verily He ordains what He willeth for whomsoever He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon the people of Glory who heard the Call and answered their Lord, the King of Names and Creator of Heaven.\n\n=== END BH00826 ===\n\n=== START BH00827 ===\n\nIn the name of the Lord of Utterance, the All-WiseAll praise be to the sanctified Lord Who hath illumined the world through the splendours of the Daystar of His grace. From the letter \"B\" He hath made the Most Great Ocean to appear, and from the letter \"H\" He hath caused His inmost Essence to be made manifest. He is that Almighty One Whose purpose the might of men can never hope to frustrate and the flow of Whose utterance the hosts of kings are powerless to halt.Thy letter was received, and We perused it and heard thy call. Within it were enshrined the precious pearls of love and the hidden mysteries of affection. We beseech the peerless Lord to enable thee to assist His Cause and to lead those who are sore athirst in the wilderness of ignorance to the water of life. His might, in truth, is equal to all things. That which thou didst ask of the Ocean of Knowledge and the Orb of Insight hath met with His acceptance.The first question: \"In what tongue and towards what direction doth it behoove us to worship the one true God?\"The beginning of all utterance is the worship of God, and this followeth upon His recognition. Sanctified must be the eye if it is to truly recognize Him, and sanctified must be the tongue if it is to befittingly utter His praise. In this Day the faces of the people of insight and understanding are turned in His direction; nay every direction inclineth itself towards Him. O lion-hearted one! We beseech God that thou mayest become a champion in this arena, arise with heavenly power and say: \"O high priests! Ears have been given you that they may hearken unto the mystery of Him Who is the Self-Dependent, and eyes that they may behold Him. Wherefore flee ye? The Incomparable Friend is manifest. He speaketh that wherein lieth salvation. Were ye, O high priests, to discover the perfume of the rose garden of understanding, ye would seek none other but Him, and would recognize, in His new vesture, the All-Wise and Peerless One, and would turn your eyes from the world and all who seek it, and would arise to help Him.\"The second question concerneth faith and religion. The Faith of God hath in this Day been made manifest. He Who is the Lord of the world is come and hath shown the way. His faith is the faith of benevolence and His religion is the religion of forbearance. This faith bestoweth eternal life and this religion enableth mankind to dispense with all else. It verily embraceth all faiths and all religions. Take hold thereof and guard it well.\n\nThe third question: \"In what manner shall we deal with the people of this age, who have each chosen to follow a different religion and who each regard their own faith and religion as excelling and surpassing all the others, that we may be shielded from the onslaught of their words and deeds?\"O lion-hearted one amongst men! Regard the afflictions endured in the path of God as comfort itself. Every affliction suffered for His sake is a potent remedy, every bitterness is naught but sweetness and every abasement an exaltation. Were men to apprehend and acknowledge this truth, they would readily lay down their lives for such affliction. For it is the key to inestimable treasures, and no matter how outwardly abhorrent, it hath ever been and will continue to be inwardly prized. We accept and affirm what thou hast said, for the people of the world are indeed bereft of the light of the Orb of justice and regard it as their enemy.If thou desirest to be freed from affliction, recite thou this prayer which hath been revealed by the Pen of the All-Merciful: \"O God, my God! I testify to Thy unity and to Thy oneness. I beseech Thee, O Thou Possessor of names and Fashioner of the heavens, by the pervasive influence of Thine exalted Word and the potency of Thy supreme Pen, to aid me with the ensigns of Thy power and might, and to protect me from the mischief of Thine enemies who have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.\" This invocation is an impregnable stronghold and an indomitable army. It conferreth protection and ensureth deliverance.The fourth question: \"Our Books have announced that Shah Bahram will come, invested with manifold signs, to guide the people aright....\"O friend! Whatsoever hath been announced in the Books hath been revealed and made clear. From every side the signs have been manifested. The Omnipotent One is calling, in this Day, and announcing the appearance of the Supreme Heaven. The world hath been illumined with the splendours of His revelation, yet how few are the eyes that can behold it! Beseech the peerless and incomparable Lord to bestow a penetrating insight upon His servants, for insight leadeth to true knowledge and is conducive to salvation. Indeed, the attainments of man's understanding are dependent upon his keenness of sight. Were the children of men to gaze with the eye of understanding, they would see the world illumined with a new light in this Day. Say: The Daystar of knowledge is manifest and the Luminary of insight hath appeared. Fortunate indeed is the one who hath attained, who hath witnessed, and who hath recognized.\n\nThe fifth question concerneth the bridge of ?ira?, Paradise, and Hell. The Prophets of God have come in truth and have spoken the truth. Whatsoever the Messenger of God hath announced hath been and will be made manifest. The world is established upon the foundations of reward and punishment. Knowledge and understanding have ever affirmed and will continue to affirm the reality of Paradise and Hell, for reward and punishment require their existence. Paradise signifieth first and foremost the good-pleasure of God. Whosoever attaineth His good-pleasure is reckoned and recorded among the inhabitants of the most exalted paradise and will attain, after the ascension of his soul, that which pen and ink are powerless to describe. For them that are endued with insight and have fixed their gaze upon the Most Sublime Vision, the Bridge, the Balance, Paradise, Hellfire, and all that hath been mentioned and recorded in the Sacred Scriptures are clear and manifest. At the time of the appearance and manifestation of the rays of the Daystar of Truth, all occupy the same station. God then proclaimeth that which He willeth, and whoso heareth His call and acknowledgeth His truth is accounted among the inhabitants of Paradise. Such a soul hath traversed the Bridge, the Balance, and all that hath been recorded regarding the Day of Resurrection, and hath reached his destination. The Day of God's Revelation is the Day of the most great Resurrection. We cherish the hope that, quaffing from the choice wine of divine inspiration and the pure waters of heavenly grace, thou mayest attain the station of discovery and witnessing, and behold, both outwardly and inwardly, all that which thou hast mentioned.The sixth question: \"After relinquishing the body, that is to say, after the soul hath been separated from the body, it hasteneth to the abode hereafter....\"In reference to this theme there appeared some time past from the Pen of divine knowledge that which sufficeth the men of insight and imparteth the greatest joy to the people of understanding. Verily, We say: The soul is gladdened by goodly deeds and profiteth from the contributions made in the path of God.The seventh question regardeth the name, lineage, and ancestry of the Holy One. Abu'l-Fadl-i-Gulpaygani, upon him be My glory, hath written in this regard, based on the Sacred Scriptures, that which bestoweth knowledge and increaseth understanding.\n\nThe Faith of God is endowed with penetrating might and power. Erelong that which hath flowed from Our tongue will outwardly come to pass. We beseech God to bestow upon thee the strength to assist Him. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. Wert thou to obtain and peruse the Suriy-i-Ra'is and the Suriy-i-Muluk, thou wouldst find thyself able to dispense with thy questions and wouldst arise to serve the Cause of God in such wise that the oppression of the world and the onslaught of its peoples would fail to deter thee from aiding Him Who is the ancient and sovereign Lord of all.We implore God to confirm thee in that which will exalt and immortalize thy name. Make thou an effort, that haply thou mayest obtain the aforementioned Tablets and acquire therefrom a share of the pearls of wisdom and utterance that have issued from the treasury of the Pen of the All-Merciful. The glory of God rest upon thee, upon every steadfast and unwavering heart and upon every constant and faithful soul.\n\n=== END BH00827 ===\n\n=== START BH00828 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!O Abul-Qasim!

The bounty of thy Lord hath encompassed thee. Verily, He is with whosoever hath turned unto Him and arisen to serve Him. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions to do what He loveth and pleaseth. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty. We have desired to make mention of those whose names thou hast mentioned, that God's favor unto thee and unto them might be perfected. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful.O Ali-Akbar! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My Most Sublime Vision. Verily, He hath made mention of thee through verses whose fragrances have perfumed the worlds of dominion and kingdom, that thine eyes and the eyes of those who have turned with illumined hearts unto My luminous horizon might be solaced thereby. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold thee or the doubts of the dubious sadden thee. Cast aside the people and what they possess, taking hold of that which thou hast been commanded by God, the Lord of all worlds.O Husayn! The Wronged One hath made mention of thee in the prison, that the Call might attract thee to the Most Exalted Summit. Thy Lord, verily, is the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Beware lest the might of those who have disbelieved in God, the Master of the Day of Judgment, frighten thee. Those who have attained unto the traces of My Pen are among those drawn nigh in My Perspicuous Book. We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe trustworthiness and godliness, and that whereby the light of man might shine resplendent throughout all existence. Thus hath the Pen of the Most Merciful spoken in this exalted station.O Rajab! Thy letter was present before the Throne. We heard thy call and have answered thee with a word from which the fragrance of permission hath been wafted. Verily, thy Lord doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.O Ibrahim! The Truth hath appeared and revealed what was hidden in knowledge, inscribed in the Books, and mentioned in the hearts of the Messengers. Blessed is he who hath recognized His days and attained unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Woe unto him who hath denied God's proof and evidence and turned away from Him, following the idle fancies of the fanciful. Cast behind thee all else but God, turning unto God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne. Verily, they who have turned unto Him with their hearts are in the vicinity of their Lord's mercy, the Guardian over all who are in the heavens and on earth.O Ali-Akbar! The world hath been honored by the advent of My Most Great Name, yet the nations are wrapped in a thick veil. Blessed is he who hath turned, whom the turning away of the people hath not hindered, and who hath directed his heart toward God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Give thanks unto God for having caused thy name to flow from His Most Exalted Pen and for having taught thee His straight path.\n\nO Nasrullah! The Wronged One makes mention of thee - He through whose name the standards of victory and triumph were hoisted amongst mankind, and through whose command the banners of guidance were raised amidst all peoples, and the Dove warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Knowledge. The Promise has come, and the Promised One has appeared with a Cause before which neither the armies of the world nor the ranks of nations can stand. He speaks and will continue to speak before all faces: \"There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.\" We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which will manifest your glory and the elevation of your stations. He is verily the All-Wise Teacher. Blessed is he who seeks His purpose and acts according to that which He has commanded in the Book. We make mention of thy mother, as a token of Our grace, and of those handmaidens who have turned to and believed in God, the Lord of Lords. We have made mention of every maidservant who has turned to and believed in a Book which none has comprehended save God, the Lord of Creation.O Ali-Qabl-Muhammad! We have adorned the world with the ornament of wisdom and utterance, and have manifested that which was hidden from sight. Blessed is the one whose strength was not weakened by the circumstances of oppression, who arose and said: \"God is my Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven.\" We beseech God to ordain for thee that which will draw thee closer in all conditions. He is verily the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O people of God! Be not grieved by what has befallen you of hardship and tribulation. You have attained unto that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure through the eternity of Our Most Beautiful Names and Our Most Exalted Attributes. To this testifies the Mother Book in the most exalted station.O Muhammad-Qabl-Ali! The Point round which circle the Concourse on High makes mention of thee from His Most Glorious Horizon and commands thee to that which will exalt the Cause of God amongst His servants. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of Akka: \"There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\" He forgives whom He willeth through His grace, and chastises whom He desireth through His decree. He is verily the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Beware lest the happenings of the world prevent thee from the remembrance of My Most Great Name. Be thou mindful amongst My servants, steadfast in service to My Cause, and hold fast to the cord of My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.O Abul-Qasim!

The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, and upon every one steadfast and firm whom nothing whatsoever has deterred from this Cause, whereby the limbs of every stubborn infidel have quaked.

We beseech God to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him and benefit them in His realms. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving.We seal this utterance with the mention of him who loved Me and soared in the atmosphere of My love and heard My call and stood before My face and acknowledged that which My tongue hath spoken, and recognized that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will in My Books, My Scrolls, and My Tablets. He was named Haydar-Qabl-Ali. We testify that he attained unto acceptance in the first days and arose to serve the Cause in such wise that the clamor of the ignorant ones who came between God and His loved ones did not deter him - they who committed that which caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and then those who circle round the Throne morning and evening. His letter hath come before the Wronged One wherein he made mention of God's loved ones there and desired for each one of them the favors of God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Each name hath attained unto My mention, as witnessed by Him Who possesseth the Mother of Tablets. We beseech God to aid you and ordain for you that which will preserve you from those who have cast the ordinance of God behind their backs and followed the manifestations of fancy and vain imaginings.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord my God, Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word through which all things were enraptured, and by the surging waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, O Lord of all mankind and Sovereign of both this world and the next, to ordain through Thy Most Exalted Pen for Thy loved ones that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity, the sun of Thy bounty, and the sea of Thy giving. O Lord! These are they who have turned unto Thee in Thy days, who have hearkened unto Thy sweetest call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and who have witnessed that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken in the kingdom of creation. I beseech Thee by the rain-showers of the springtime of Thy favor and by the mysteries of Thy grace and mercy, to aid them under all conditions to remain steadfast in Thy Cause, through which the limbs of the people have trembled. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\\[This sentence appears at the end of this book: \"The copy of the sacred Tablets that were revealed by the Most Exalted Pen for the loved ones is in the handwriting of Bahajist Muhammad Ali, entitled the Greater Branch, son of Baha'u'llah.

We found it a mirror reflecting your love for the Beloved of the world and your orientation towards Him. Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh, having drunk, and having attained. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the Manifest One. We have witnessed the fire that hath encompassed thee in thy love for thy Lord, and We have seen its flames and heard its roaring. Exalted is He Who kindled it, ignited it, and manifested it. He is the One with power at Whose manifestation of might the very essence of power confesseth its powerlessness. Thy Lord is He Who heareth and seeth; He is the All-Informed. Rejoice in that the Wronged One maketh mention of thee even as He mentioned thee before, and in this hour He walketh and saith: \"I have found the fragrance of thy love and witnessed thy sincerity and humility, as thy heart was engaged in My remembrance and thy tongue was occupied in uttering My beauteous praise.\" Thus hath the Water of Life flowed forth that thou mayest rejoice in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nO handmaiden! Your call was heard and your letter was presented before the Throne. Praise be to God that the flames of divine love were witnessed therein. God willing, thou wilt ever be delighting in the remembrance of the Friend, drinking in His Name, finding rest in His memory, and occupied with His thought, that perchance distant souls may draw nigh unto the ocean of nearness, and weary spirits may hasten, through the warmth of the Word, toward that direction which is sanctified from all directions.Some of the faithful are observed to be sorrowful, nay rather fearful, on account of the event that hath come to pass in the land of ?ad, whereas the Hand of God's power hath, through His special favor, raised them up and showered upon them from the heaven of mercy and the clouds of bounty the rain of grace and blessing. His complete power hath adorned them with the raiment of glory amongst mankind, such that the tongues of the sincere ones and those brought nigh have spoken their praise. They attained such a station that even their enemies bore witness to the loftiness of their rank, and in their final days they achieved the most exalted and supreme station, which is that of the Most Great Martyrdom - a station which, from time immemorial unto eternity, hath been and will ever be sought after by the chosen ones and friends of God. Nevertheless, some are seen to be troubled and grieved.God willing, this sorrow hath appeared because of love for them. By the ocean of inner meanings! Were the station of but one of their servants who are now engaged in service to be revealed, all the peoples of the earth would be thunderstruck. Blessed is he who reflecteth upon what hath come to pass, that he may become aware of the greatness of the Cause and its sovereignty. This station which they attained was what they themselves had beseeched from God, glorified and exalted be He, and what they had sought with the utmost yearning and desire.Say: O friends! Ye have endured much in the path of love for the Beloved of the worlds. Ye have witnessed what was not worthy to be seen, and heard what was not worthy to be heard, and in the path of the Friend ye have borne matters which were in truth heavier than mountains. Blessed be your appearance, your eyes, and your ears, for what they have borne, seen, and heard. Now, know ye the value of this most exalted and sublime station, and waste it not. In every case, this world is transient and all who dwell therein shall fall prey to death, and all that is therein shall be afflicted by the claws of change.Ask ye God, glorified and exalted be He, at all times, to preserve you and keep you steadfast on the path of His Cause. Know ye this much: that whatsoever ye have borne in His path, or seen, or heard - this hath been through His grace and favor, wherewith ye have been specially endowed, and this mention of you in the Tablets hath been and will continue to be another of His bounties. Ye have tasted the cup of tribulation in His path; now drink ye the choice sealed wine from the cups of His remembrance and favors.God willing, may ye be assisted to serve the Cause. We counsel all to manifest praiseworthy characteristics, goodly deeds, and befitting actions. Today it behooveth everyone to hold fast unto that which will exalt the Cause of God and to cleave thereunto. Say: We say only this much, and leave the rest to your own sense of justice as to what beseemeth such a Day. Be not grieved by outward weakness, abasement, and distress. By the Sun of the heaven of independence, wealth and riches circle round about you, make mention of you, and are inclined toward you. If one considers the divine wisdom, their appearance remained veiled for some days. Days will come when each one will appear manifest and radiant like the sun. We beseech God that people may attain unto the sweetness of divine utterances and truly find them. The Glory be upon you from Us, and upon your brother, and upon My Name who gave up his spirit in My path and dwelleth in the precincts of My mercy. We make mention at the end of the Book of your brother who turned his face toward My countenance, stood before the gate of My grandeur, and heard My wondrous and mighty call. God willing, may that which hath been mentioned not pass from their sight. May they be assured of divine grace, drink at all times from the choice wine of remembrance, gaze toward His direction, and God willing, may the mention of love and unity not pass from sight.At this point We make mention of him who was named Kazim, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed art thou and thy brother who was martyred in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Behold, then make mention of Our servant Kazim who was martyred in the land of Sad - a martyrdom at whose tragedy the atoms of all created things wept, and beyond them the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the cities of names. Thy Lord, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this.O Kazim! Reflect upon God's grace and observe His mercy that hath preceded all the worlds. Ponder the blessed word that was revealed in the Book of Ha and Sin where He saith, and His word is the truth: \"Whoso is God's, God is his.\" And since those holy souls gave up the world and all therein in the path of the Lord of Oneness and attained unto the chalice of martyrdom which is in truth the most exalted cup, the Supreme Pen is seen to be engaged and moving in their remembrance morn and eve. By the Sun of the Kingdom of utterance! If the scratching of the Supreme Pen were truly heard by an attentive ear, all people would leave their homes and cry out \"Here am I, O God, here am I!\" Blessed is the ear that heareth and the heart that perceiveth what hath transpired, and the taste that hath tasted what hath appeared from the ocean of thy Lord's grace, the Forgiving, the Generous.O Kazim! Act according to that which thou hast been commanded and thou shalt witness thy Lord's grace encompassing the worlds. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the most great steadfastness in this Cause whereby the mountains were scattered, the heaven was cleft asunder, the earth was split, and the people were shaken, save those whom God wished, the Powerful, the Protector, the Mighty.And whatsoever was mentioned in your letter was presented before the Most Holy Court.

And blessings and peace be upon His chosen one and His beloved, the Point around which revolve the spheres of knowledge and utterance, of wisdom and exposition, and upon His family and companions whom God hath made the hands of His Cause and the manifestations of His remembrance, and through whom God hath aided His religion. Verily He is the Strong, the All-Wise.And then, your letter arrived at a time when this servant found no opportunity to offer a reply, as time was utterly lacking and no one was available in the castle to deliver the response. Thus it remained delayed. Although through divine grace you are at all times blessed with the mention, utterance, and loving-kindness of our Master (may my spirit be sacrificed for His sake), to such a degree that all bear witness to this supreme bounty and magnificent gift. The first purpose was and is the well-being of the Afnans of the Blessed Tree - upon them be all His Most Glorious Beauty - and yourself, as well as the other friends of God, upon them be God's peace. Secondly, mention was made of ?abib. God willing, may he be assisted in a matter of which he is now unaware of its fruits. Praise be to God, you went on a special mission and now return with special permission. Its beginning was peace and its end light and mercy.Regarding what was written about the wish of the Leaf of the Blessed Tree - upon her be all His Most Glorious Beauty - in these days fourteen accepted souls intend to return from this land. It was thought that if it reaches these souls, it would be acceptable for expenditure on the path. And when it was presented before His presence, He said: \"O servant present, write to Abu'l-Hasan - upon him be My glory - that the Leaf's own wish must be carried out. We have accepted this that it may be a glory and honor to her. We have commanded the servant present to undertake the accomplishment of this service wherever possible. Otherwise, the matter is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" End.\n\nPraise be to God that the effulgent rays of the Sun of acceptance illumined and adorned with its most beauteous ornament the kingdom of hope. Upon first arrival at the barracks, His Holiness the Afnan, my master, the honorable J.A. who ascended to the Most Exalted Horizon, sent a letter expressing his desire that a set of special lamp fixtures be sent to the Holy Presence. After this was presented, it was stated that although the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - had commanded that 2001 exquisite and sublime lamps and adorned and lofty lights be lit before Him, yet now the Wronged One dwells in military barracks, in a house whose curtains are spiderwebs and whose dilapidation is evident from all sides. Although this ruined house is, in the sight of God, more excellent, more beloved and more glorious than a palace of rubies, yet outwardly such accoutrements befit not this desolate place. Now, through the wondrous infinite grace, that praiseworthy and accepted deed has been manifested through the intention of the Leaf, and has been honored with acceptance. His is the praise and the glory, His is the gratitude and the splendor. Give glad tidings to that beloved of the Leaf - upon her be nine-fold most glorious splendor - of this manifest, brilliant, radiant benevolence. And all that was mentioned refers to the special grace and favor shown to the Afnan of the Sacred Tree. The servant indeed praises God his Lord and thanks Him for this bounty which has encompassed the Afnans - upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful.This evanescent servant presents his utter effacement and nothingness to all, and likewise to the assured, steadfast, pure, sanctified and tranquil souls. At the letter's end: We await your most sweet, most sweet presence. Peace and glory be upon you, and God's mercy and \\[blessings\\].The Servant22nd of the honored month of Shawwal 1300He is God!It is submitted that after completing this letter, another missive arrived from that beloved one, hence it became necessary to trouble you again. God the One is witness that this servant feels the utmost gratitude and embarrassment toward that beloved one. Indeed, you have shown the utmost diligence in investigating and searching for marble and other stones. In this world few people understand one's purpose and grasp what is intended in matters, but that beloved one has exceeded expectations and taken great pains, recording various opinions and views. What that honored one has mentioned is correct, for marble is indeed superior, more excellent, more splendid and more beautiful. However, considering the times, various stones have been and are being mentioned, with the intention that the cost not exceed moderation.Regarding what you wrote that there are many options available - indeed it is just as you wrote. It is very good that you have made inquiries from others besides Habib. This servant had also intended to mention to you that there are some good craftsmen there - do make inquiries from them as well as from Habib. Praise be to God that beloved one has, of his own accord, done what was in this evanescent one's mind. Now what is needed is to meet with you. Please determine from Nicholas the mason what daily wages would be required if we were to request a master craftsman to come to Akka. Please specify this matter. After your arrival we can discuss - if agreeable we will request that craftsman, otherwise not.And regarding what you wrote that it was decided to bring both a simple design and an ornate design - this is good, along with the fountain designs mentioned. Now we await that beloved one's arrival.\n\nAnother matter: there is a stone found here known as Jules stone, and Jules is a village outside of Akka at a distance of one hour. Consult with the craftsmen - if they deem it suitable, let them send a craftsman who is truly skilled and capable of completing the task, to provide instructions for cutting it. Let the craftsman finish it, then Nicola or Habib can come and assemble it. Habib's craftsman has seen that stone, and in any case the craftsman's fee must be determined. If it is deemed advisable, we shall request it. Another matter: the letter of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, was not given. The reason for this will be mentioned when we meet. That honored one should not mention anything about this, as there was concern it might cause distress. After the meeting, whatever is deemed advisable will be carried out. The Glory be upon you.\n\n=== END BH00830 ===\n\n=== START BH00831 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!Praise be to God Who hath taught us that He is the Doer, the All-Choosing. He doeth what He willeth, speaketh as He pleaseth, and expoundeth as He desireth. At times I hear from the Tongue of Grandeur that \"I am the All-Knowing,\" and at other times that \"I have been sanctified from it from time immemorial.\" Sometimes He proclaimeth with the most exalted call that \"With Me is the knowledge of the heavens and earth,\" and at other times He calleth out and saith \"With Me is naught save the knowledge of Mine own Self, and I am the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\" He is the One around Whose gate's courtyard no decree save truth can draw nigh, even should He decree for the earth what is decreed in heaven, and in Whose atmosphere no bird of forgetfulness can soar, even should He say \"I have forgotten what was sent down from the heaven of My will in the scriptures and tablets.\"Praise be to God Who hath made known to us His straight path and His Most Great Name, and hath manifested unto us that whereby every mouldering bone is quickened. I pray, offer salutations and glorify those whom the affairs of the world have not prevented from the Most Exalted Horizon, and whom the might of princes hath not weakened from standing firm in this Cause, whereby the limbs of all things have trembled. These are honored servants whom God hath described through the tongue of His Beloved, His Chosen One, the Seal of His Prophets and the Example to His chosen ones - by whom the Night Journey was adorned and the gate of knowledge was opened to all who dwell in the realm of possibility - as \"honored servants, on whom there is no fear, neither shall they grieve.\"Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee by the Primal Point and the Most Exalted Word to ordain for Thy servants who have believed in Thee and Thy signs that which will draw them nearer unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.Thereafter, this evanescent servant attained unto the honor of reading thy exalted letter. Praise be to God, it brought such joy as this servant is powerless to describe, for each of its words was adorned with the lights of the love of God. After its perusal and reading, it was presented before His presence. The Sun of loving-kindness dawned and shone forth from the Dayspring of grace. God willing, may they forever be blessed with the outpourings of the True Bestower in both the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. Verily, He is the Munificent Giver. Let them in all conditions observe and hold fast unto wisdom. Until they find ears to hear, let them not speak. Previously this blessed word flowed from the Pen: \"Cast the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure earth of the heart, and water them with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green from the holy city.\" And in another place He saith: \"The wise ones among My servants are those who speak not till they find a listener, even as the cup-bearer who proffereth not the cup till he findeth one who seeketh it, and the lover who crieth not out from his soul until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved.\" Therefore must ye sow the seeds of knowledge and wisdom in the earth of search and conceal them, that divine wisdom may sprout from the heart and not from mere clay. For the people are intoxicated with the wine of pride and are unaware of the pure and holy Fountain. They strive according to their own understanding to prove a fault and raise an uproar. Verily, He loveth wisdom and commandeth you to observe wisdom, even as He commanded you aforetime. He, verily, is the True Counsellor, the Trustworthy. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAs to the question asked about the blessed word - although the exact verse is not in view - O beloved of my heart and the one remembered in my heart, most utterances are revealed in the language of the people, and in the heavenly Books there are many such instances. No one has been or is aware of the consummate divine wisdom and inner mysteries of the Lord, except for that which He Himself reveals and commands His servants to follow. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - in one place states that if anyone claims for me special prophethood, guardianship or particular gateship, he has uttered falsehood and I am innocent of him. Yet in another place He speaks that which the reality of understanding is powerless to comprehend. The Truth, exalted be His station, is the possessor of the Most Great Infallibility, and the meaning of the Most Great Infallibility is that error, mistake and forgetfulness have no access whatsoever to that realm. This is the station of \"He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\" If He declares the qiblih to be toward the east, it is the indubitable truth, and if He declares it to be toward the west, likewise. Even as in the Qur'an, the Beloved of all possibility, in accordance with the command of the All-Merciful, turned toward the qiblih of Islam to which they turn today. \"Were He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to question why and wherefore.\" I swear by the Sun of Truth that were a breeze from the direction of this station to pass over the withered trees of possibility, all would be seen fresh and verdant. Blessed are they who understand.As to the question about the inscription at the end of one of the blessed Tablets reading \"Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali, Mine of God's Command\" - if this was not a scribal error, by the precedence of Muhammad before 'Ali is meant His Holiness Quddus - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - who was known by the name Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali and who attained the supreme martyrdom in the land of Mim. Upon him and upon those with him be the glory of God, His light, and the loving-kindness and mercy of God.As to the mention that He has said that whoever attributes miracles to this Most Great Manifestation has uttered falsehood and calumny - this word was revealed before the Manifestation, as a wisdom from His presence and protection for the servants. Had this evanescent servant found opportunity, he would have explained these matters in detail, but in any case he hopes for forgiveness.Regarding the matter of the veil about which they wrote, this servant was confirmed in writing one and it was sent. God willing, they will attain unto it. As for the final veil, I beseech God to grant confirmation that perchance it may be written and dispatched.My request and entreaty to your honor is to adorn each of the friends of God residing in that land with greetings from this evanescent one, and to express pure devotion. This evanescent servant beseeches God - glorified be His majesty - to aid and confirm all to that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the confirmer of His devoted servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Glory and remembrance and greetings be upon you and upon them and upon every steadfast believer.The Servant\n\nIn Muharram 1298\n\nAs to the manner of preserving the sacred talisman after performing ablutions: Wholly detached from all else, and turning to God, the Lord of Earth and Heaven, one should sit facing the Qiblih. Then recite the verse of power which is inscribed in the first line, followed by the Names of God which are recorded in the second line. Then, with the utmost humility, reverence, detachment, attention and sincerity, fold it and keep it without opening it again. And if at any time, for any reason, it is opened, all that was mentioned must be performed anew.\n\n=== END BH00831 ===\n\n=== START BH00832 ===\n\nHis honour Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of GodThe Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-SubsistingHe is God, exalted be His station, the Benevolent, the BestowerPraise be to God Who hath opened the gates of knowledge and learning to the faces of His servants and revealed that which was hidden in the treasuries of His knowledge.

He verily adorneth thee with the ornament of utterance and guideth thee to the path of God, the Lord of all lords. Thy letter hath attained unto My presence. We have answered thee with this Tablet through which that which was hidden from eyes hath been revealed. This is a day wherein the gate of munificence hath been opened unto all who are in the world, and the gate of bounty unto all who are in existence. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of this Day which God hath made the lord of days. Rejoice in that the Lord of the worlds hath remembered thee in His Most Great Prison and hath revealed for thee that which caused the Trumpet to be sounded and the mountains to pass away.O Muhammad-Qabli-Hadi! My Most Exalted Pen hath desired to mention thee and to reveal for thee that whereby the atoms cried out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Day of Return!\" Say: O people! The Day hath come and the Call hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon. Fear ye the Lord of all beings, Who hath come from the horizon of might with power and sovereignty. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto My call and the servant that hath turned unto the Dayspring of lights.O concourse of loved ones! There hath been ordained for you from the Pen of Destiny that which hath attracted the hearts of the righteous. Beware lest the happenings of the world and the clamor of nations sadden you. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been given by God, the Lord of all beings. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect you and aid you in that which will draw you nigh unto Him. He is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.Your mention hath attained Our presence and We have revealed for you again and again that whereby the trees have called out and uttered what the Tree of Sinai uttered unto the son of 'Imran. The Glory of God be upon you from God, the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven.O Mahdi! Hearken unto My everlasting remembrance. It verily draweth thee nigh unto God and guideth thee unto the right path. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison and for having revealed unto me that which will not change with the passing of centuries and ages.O Asadu'llah! The Lord of Names hath mentioned thee with verses which, when revealed, caused the earth to be cleft asunder and the heavens to be rent. Rejoice that the Lord of the world hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and hath revealed for thee that whereby the Call hath been raised from every direction.O Mirza Ghafur! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having turned unto thee and mentioned thee with verses whereby the lands have been illumined. Say: O people! Fear ye God and follow not those who have denied His proof and His testimony, and pursue not every heedless doubter.O Mirza-Qabli-Na?ir! The Glorious One hath turned unto thee and given thee to drink, from the hand of His bounty, the Kawthar of His utterance. Take thou in His Name, then drink at His command, the Protector of all regions. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, for having mentioned me with verses which, when revealed, caused all things to proclaim: \"By God! The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come in the shadows of the clouds.\"\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Mahdi, who hath turned towards the horizon of Revelation and believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. We beseech for thee steadfastness, and for those who have believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. How many a servant hath believed and claimed for himself the most great steadfastness, then his foot hath slipped because of the doubts of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed. Take hold of the Book with a power that the ranks and hosts cannot prevent.O Muhammad-Qabli-Ja'far! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily it guideth thee unto God, the Lord of existence. Blessed is the servant whom vain desires have not kept back from the Lord of all men, and whom the intimations of every heedless one that is veiled have not caused to slip. Take what thou art bidden and set aside what the people possess, as a command from God, the Mighty, the Loving. O people! Observe God's ordinances amongst you and that which ye have been counselled in His praiseworthy station.O Mirza-Qabli-Ghulamali! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the prison precincts and hath made mention of thee in such wise as to cause thy name to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Beware, beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan prevent thee from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of existence. Beware, beware lest that which hath been revealed in the Bayan veil thee. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Take hold of the hem of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of destiny, and say: I beseech Thee, O Lord of mankind, to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy Cause and vocal in Thy praise amongst Thy servants. Verily, Thou art the Commander, the Mighty, the Beloved.O Haji Majid! Thy name was presented before Us. We have made mention of thee and have sent down for thee that which draweth hearts unto themselves. Beware lest anything prevent thee, or any power weaken thee, or any might frighten thee. Set aside what the people possess and take what thou art bidden by God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Verily, We have manifested that which was hidden and have sent down that which was treasured in God's knowledge at this flourishing station.O Mahdi! The Commander hath come, yet the people know not, and the Bestower hath come riding upon the clouds, yet most men perceive not. Arise with utmost steadfastness in this Cause, at whose appearance the herald proclaimed: \"By God, the Preserved Tablet hath appeared!\" Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast guided me unto Thy extended path.\"O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! The Promise hath come to pass, and He Who was promised maketh mention of thee in such wise as hath caused the fragrance of God's utterance to be diffused throughout all possibilities. Blessed is he who hath found and recognized, and woe unto every heedless one that is veiled. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the cup of bounty, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all men, for having sent down unto me Thy verses and manifested unto me Thy clear tokens.

Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the souls of men. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken forth from this luminous horizon. Take thou the chalice of utterance in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink therefrom through this wondrous and glorious remembrance.

He will forever be as He hath always been. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. He hath manifested the clear proofs and sent down the verses in such wise that the horizons have been filled therewith. The Path hath appeared, the Balance hath been set up, and He hath called all to a station that transcendeth description. He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.Thereafter, your honor had previously given this servant a page containing the names of God's loved ones. In these days it was presented at the Most Holy Court, and for each one, a line from the Hidden Tablet was revealed and sent down. His is all praise and bounty, His is all glory and laudation and grandeur. I swear by the Sun of the heavens of truth that the like of this favor hath never appeared in the world, nor shall it ever appear. In the nights and days, the glances of His grace have been and will continue to be directed towards His friends. This evanescent one and your honor must beseech Him, glorified be His majesty, that He may enable all to render thanks and perform such deeds as befit these days and this bounty, that He may adorn all with the raiment of submission and crown them with the diadems of contentment. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, to Whose might all atoms testify, and the Self-Subsisting, to Whose sovereignty all created things bear witness. My mention and the mention of what is above me and above that which is above me, nay the mention of the world and the peoples and what is above them and below them, can never attain to the most insignificant of the signs which He hath deposited in His kingdom. Glorified, glorified is He above all meaning and utterance, above all mention and description, above all words and understanding.And this new letter which they have written to your honor from Yazd and given to this servant - in these days when verses are being revealed and sent down like torrential rain, I presented it at the Most Holy Court. He mentioned each one with His blessed tongue, and the Sun of divine favor rose upon each one. This servant is powerless to describe it. By the True One Himself, were but one letter thereof to shine upon the darkest night, it would become as the night of the full moon. God willing, may all receive their portion from the breezes of these days and engage in serving the Cause, for that which causeth strife, contention and corruption hath never been and will never be the cause of the exaltation of the Cause, but rather leadeth to its waste. God willing, all should assist the divine Cause through pure and holy deeds, noble resolve, and praiseworthy and acceptable conduct. Time and again have I heard such utterances from the Tongue of Grandeur and conveyed them to the friends of God. May this servant and all be enabled to achieve that which is pleasing to the Desired One of all worlds.\n\nMention hath been made repeatedly in the Most Holy Presence of Aqa Siyyid Husayn, upon him be Baha'u'llah, and his letters have reached this servant. That honored one can bear witness that this servant hath rarely had, and still rarely hath, opportunity to write. Yet not everything that remaineth unwritten by the pen is forgotten from the heart. God, the One, is My witness that their names are ever remembered and their thoughts ever present. Most often this ephemeral one is occupied with transcribing the divine verses, and if perchance some leisure is found, with attending to certain necessary matters about which the Point of Oneness--that is, the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for Him--left instructions. For in numerous instances He instructed all who are in the Bayan to serve the Ancient Beauty in the days of His Manifestation, particularly during His presence. Though this servant is incapable of service worthy of the servants of the Bab, yet according to his capacity some movement is made. God is the All-Forgiving, the Concealer. May He, God willing, adorn the deeds of this ephemeral one and His friends with the ornament of acceptance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Exalted, the Forgiving, the Generous.Concerning what was written about Aqa Shaykh Muhammad in this letter, it was presented before the Most Holy Presence. This blessed word shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the Divine Utterance: May he, God willing, be a breaker of the idols of passion and a guide to the path of the Lord of Names.Likewise, mention was made in that letter of Haji Mulla Ibrahim and Aqa Muhammad-Rida and others. The details of their circumstances as mentioned in the letter were presented. This is what the All-Bestowing One revealed in reply:He is the All-Knowing ExpositorRemember from Our presence those servants whom God hath freed from the chains of passion and aided to turn towards the Supreme Horizon--the station whereat the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End!\" Blessed are they who have quaffed My sealed wine through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and it is My hidden love wherewith none have been favored save those near ones who have cast away the world and taken what they were commanded by God, the Lord of the Throne and of Earth. God willing, may they, through the grace of the Lord of Days, shine bright like the stars of the heaven of utterance, and with perfect wisdom be occupied with the remembrance and praise of the Peerless Friend. By My life! This is the day of remembrance, praise, and service to the Cause. A hundred thousand regrets for those souls who have let pass from them that which befitteth and is worthy of these days. Hold ye fast to the cord of My grace and cling to the hem of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.End of the divine revelation. This ephemeral one's submission is that you convey sublime greetings to each one on behalf of this servant.Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad-Hasan 'A??ar, upon him be Baha'u'llah, they had written his details from the Land of Ha, and mentioned the allowance, and likewise the dye and cumin that they had previously sent have arrived. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid and assist him at all times in that which is the cause of an enduring goodly remembrance. Convey on behalf of this servant sublime and glorious greetings to him. May he ever be, God willing, the recipient of the outpourings of the true Bestower of Grace and be ever turned toward His horizon. The world and all that is therein shall perish, and that which endureth is the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nAs for what was written regarding Jinab-i-Ustad Baqir, upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], details about him and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Hasan were both presented before the Most Holy Court. He said: \"Excellent is what they have done in the path of God. Their remaining was preferable to traveling.\" Thus doth the All-Informed apprise them. \"Verily, We pronounce from this station Our 'Allah-u-Akbar' upon their faces, and nothing that hath been created in the realm of possibility can equal this pronouncement. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them to remain steadfast with the greatest steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped.\" Thus it ended. Praise be to God that on this blessed day a number have attained unto the remembrance of God. Blessed are those souls whose names the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered. God will soon reveal that which is veiled today. Verily, He is the Manifest, the Revealer. The Glory be upon thee and upon every name that was in thy letter, and upon all who have turned unto the One, the All-Informed. Praise be to God, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nHe is God! O Maid-servant of God! The letter thou hadst written was received. It brought exceeding joy and gladness, for it contained matters that were evidence of the steadfastness and constancy of the friends of God. It told of the unity and accord of the beloved of the Lord, and the aid and assistance they rendered unto one another. Such glad-tidings caused infinite happiness, for firmness and steadfastness in this wondrous Cause is as a magnet that draweth down the confirmations and aid from the Kingdom of God \\[...\\]\n\n=== END BH00833 ===\n\n=== START BH00834 ===\n\nHe is the Forgiver! He is the Bestower and the Kind!The Arabic utterances which were revealed in wondrous Hijazi melodies from the heaven of Divine sovereignty exceed the limits of enumeration and the comprehension of men of understanding. However, due to differences in tongues and perception, some have failed to grasp God's purpose and have remained veiled from the Desired One and deprived of their goal. Therefore, in this Tablet, we shall mention briefly some of the gems of divine counsels and realities of heavenly exhortations in melodious Iraqi and Persian verses, so that God's purpose may become manifest and evident to all the world like the rising sun and the true dawn. This is from the grace which was foreordained for you.Know ye that the Truth, exalted be His mention, has been and will ever be sanctified above the worship, servitude and remembrance of His servants, for none among created things has had or will have the capacity or ability to know Him as He should be known. The possible can soar as it may in the atmospheres of nearness, reunion, attainment and immortality, yet it can never transcend the point of contingent existence which was created by the Will that pertains to the realm of possibility. The King Who doeth what He willeth has, in the eternity of eternities, dwelt in the loftiness of His glory and the utmost heights of His beauty. And since all paths to Him were blocked and cut off from all besides Him, He did, through pure bounty and sheer grace, kindness and favor, raise up in every age and epoch a Soul to guide His servants from the valley of heedlessness and passion to the heights of glory and eternity, and to lead them from the realm of poverty and nothingness to the heaven of wealth and existence, that perchance these holy birds might be drawn to their divine homeland, and being sanctified from selfish and earthly allusions, might gather in the shade of the Face of God and abide forevermore in the eternity of God.In all ages and epochs some among His servants have claimed these stations, yet never has mere assertion been accepted. Hence tests and trials have ever descended from the heaven of power that the true might be distinguished from the false. Consider how all these people claim the love of God, which is the greatest, foremost and most precedent of all things, yet even before trials descend they turn away in deed - how much more after afflictions, ordeals, calamities and tribulations! Reflect on what I say, O ye who are endowed with insight!In brief, it is certain that that Ancient Being dwells in the retreat of transcendence and the treasury of inaccessibility, established upon the throne of sanctification and abstraction. Entry and exit, ascent and descent have no place in that station. After this subtle point is established, it becomes clear to every person of insight that neither does the obedience of created things add to His glory, nor does the disobedience of existing beings detract from His majesty. Never can the deeds of the finite reach the court of the Eternal, nor can the stain of the transient soil the hem of His everlasting glory. None besides Him is mentioned before Him, and nothing other than Him has any name in His presence. The possible remains within the bounds of contingency, and the Necessary exists in the heights of sanctity and glory. After these stations are established, there remains no doubt that whatsoever has been sent down from the eternal heaven whether the purpose is the upliftment of the servants themselves, it is nonetheless far from fairness that they should deprive themselves of the holy fragrances of these days. Let this much be known: not an atom's weight of the deeds of created things remains hidden or concealed. However, in view of supreme compassion and the all-encompassing mercy upon all things, these have not been and will never be revealed or disclosed. Yet when audacity exceeds the bounds of moderation, He therefore informs certain servants that perchance they might feel ashamed and desist. Otherwise, out of His perfect mercy and grace, He has never been and will never be willing to expose the faults of His servants. Say at last to the servants of God: those who are given to transgression and lewdness, the heedless and the blind, when they visit visible gardens, strive upon their return to bring back what flowers they can as gifts. You who claim to have entered the holy paradise of divine beauty - what sign or token have you brought back from that sweet realm of the Beloved? After all, the people of the Bayan should be characterized by the fragrance of the All-Merciful, and the loved ones of the Beloved must possess the gentle breezes of the All-Glorious, that all the peoples of the earth might inhale the divine perfumes from His loved ones, and distinguish the traces of truth from falsehood as clearly as the luminous morn from the dark night. I swear by God, had this small band moved among humanity with divine attributes, by now all the peoples of the earth would be circling round the Cause of God and turning toward His sanctuary. What was decreed has come to pass. God willing, we hope that hereafter they may be resurrected from the dust of heedlessness by the holy breeze of divine oneness in a new form and wondrous guise, and arise to fulfill what they have neglected. I swear by God that never have days more delightful than these days appeared in creation, nor will there ever appear a greater season than this season. While time remains, deprive not yourselves of the eternal paradise of the All-Glorious and the garden of beauty of the All-Beauteous, and be not despairing and debarred from the cloud of bounty and the rain of grace. It is evident that this servant has always kept in view and considered the good, welfare and righteousness of God's loved ones, to such extent that He has shown more consideration for them than they themselves - and God suffices as witness. It is clear to you what measure of hidden and manifest trials have been poured upon this servant, all of which He has endured that perchance the dead bodies might be quickened by the breezes of God and might arise from the slumber of negligence through the divine morning breeze. Not that we should completely avoid association and prefer concealment to manifestation, as has become common in these days. In these days when all peoples - Arab and Persian, Turk and Fars, Christian and Jew, learned and ignorant - have risen to oppose this servant, seeking nothing but to extinguish the light of God and quench the fire of God, this servant has stood firm against them all, though aware of what they have concealed in their hearts. Now at least the loved ones should not become another source of grief and sorrow for such a servant who is encompassed by trials, afflictions and ordeals. Let us see what fairness will accomplish and how God's Cause will unfold. In all things my trust is in Him, and God is sufficient for us and the best of guardians.\n\n=== END BH00834 ===\n\n=== START BH00835 ===\n\nIn His Name, the Manifest One, Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance!Praise be sanctified above the comprehension of minds, befitting the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of the Beloved One, Who through a single exalted Word, shining forth from the dayspring of the heaven of the Mother Book, caused the ocean of utterance to appear and its waves to surge forth, raised high the heaven of knowledge and adorned it with suns and moons. Through it was the earth cleft asunder, the heaven of idle fancies rent apart, the pillars of idolatry shaken, the forces of tyranny brought to lamentation, and all the tribes of the earth seized with trembling, save those rescued by the hand of God's bounty, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is the soul that hath attained to hearing it and hath clung fast thereunto. Such a one is recorded by God among the gems of existence and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen.O Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thy numerous letters were received and the servant present before the Face presented them, attaining the honor of their being heard. From every word was diffused the fragrance of steadfastness, devotion, arising to serve, orientation toward God, and detachment. We praise God for His grace, His loving-kindness, and His favors in having aided you, drawn you nigh, and sent down for you that which calleth out in the realms of knowledge and wisdom, and for your humility and submissiveness to the Cause of God, the Lord of Lords.O Ahmad! Hear once again the call from the Most Exalted Horizon: Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not the desires of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. Whoso objecteth to this Cause hath indeed objected to God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Cast aside what the people possess and hasten to the good-pleasure of God. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in a station wherein naught is seen save the lights of the Face and naught is heard save the verses of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.Thou didst hear the Call when it was raised from the Prison of Akka, and thou didst behold the Most Exalted Horizon while the people were in manifest delusion. Blessed art thou for having acknowledged that which flowed from the Most Exalted Pen while the Wronged One was in this mighty stronghold. Say: O peoples of the earth! The Lord of Heaven hath come from the Most Exalted Horizon with the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Fear ye God and follow not every deluded remote one - those who are moved by the tempests of idle fancies as they please. Verily they are among the oppressors in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.We have mentioned thee before with a mention by which the hearts of the sincere were attracted, and We have revealed for thee that which consoled the eyes of them that are nigh, and We have manifested for thee from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Be thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics.\n\nWe have lit for thee the lamp of divine knowledge in the niche of utterance and have preserved it with the glass of wisdom. Verily, thy Lord doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. Say: O concourse of the Furqan! Behold ye, then call to mind that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in this momentous announcement. Be fair in the name of God and follow not your ignorant divines who have violated God's covenant and His testament when there came unto them the Kingdom of divine utterance from the presence of One mighty and powerful. O people of the Bayan! Hearken unto that which My Herald hath spoken, and oppose not Him Who hath come unto you from the Dayspring of the Cause with a wondrous command. O people of the Gospel! Read that which God hath revealed unto the Spirit, and be not of the wrongdoers. I am verily the Station unto which the Spirit ascended, were ye of them that comprehend. I am the Book from which all the Books of God have been expounded, were ye of the fair-minded. That which was never manifest before hath now been made manifest - to this beareth witness the Tongue of Grandeur from this exalted Station. Purify your hearts from the dust of idle fancies, then aid Him through deeds from which every possessor of perception will inhale the fragrance of sanctity and the sweet savour of sincerity unto God, the Peerless, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.Remind My loved ones there and gladden them with My tender mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O people of Baha! Beware lest ye be hindered by the cawing of every remote croaker. Soon will there come unto you one who speaketh according to his desires - he is assuredly of the calumniators in the Book of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Believe not in one who cometh unto you with that which causeth affairs to differ. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of the ignorant ones. Take ye the chalice of steadfastness in My Name, then drink from it in remembrance of Me, the All-Wise. Say: Turn with illumined hearts unto the Most Sublime Horizon, detached from those who speak that which God hath not permitted them. Thus doth the Divine Lote-Tree instruct you, and the Tongue of God counselleth you in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of loving-kindness and grace from One compassionate and generous.When the wine of thy Lord's utterance hath intoxicated thee and the Kawthar of divine knowledge hath attracted thee, say: I beseech Thee, O my Lord, the Gracious, by Thy Command that dominateth all things possible, and by the splendours of the lights of the Sun of Thy manifestation, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy unity, to make me speak in remembrance of Thee and hold fast to Thy cord in such wise that neither the Pharaohs of the lands nor the oppressors among the servants shall hinder me. Then cause to appear from this servant of Thine, O my God, that which shall endure as long as Thy celestial dominion and Thy realm of might endureth. O Lord! I am he who hath cast away idle fancies, hastening unto the lights of Thy countenance, and hath abandoned vain imaginings, running unto the court of Thy glory. I beseech Thee by the lamp of Thy Cause and by that which was hidden in Thy knowledge to aid me in that which Thou lovest and approvest, and ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nHear in the Persian tongue! Praise be to God, thou hast been favored with His special grace and art mentioned and remembered before the Wronged One. Convey to all thy kindred the greetings of the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of the waves of God's ocean of grace and bounty. Likewise to the friends in that land, that all may drink from the Kawthar of the utterance of Him Who is the Goal of all the worlds and be illumined with the light of steadfastness. Unceasingly hath this word flowed from the Pen of the Ancient of Days in the Tablets: Verily the Cause is mighty, mighty, and this Day mighty, mighty. The eyes of the loved ones must be fixed upon the Supreme Horizon, and their ears attuned to the call of the Lord of Names. Countless deluded souls are to be seen. In brief, should anyone speak that which God hath not willed, he is verily a lying impostor. To this beareth witness the Lord of Destiny from this Most Great Scene. Some have loved and do love discord. Now it is binding, nay incumbent, upon all to shun any word that causeth discord, even should it proceed from those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. Today all must engage with illumined hearts in the service of the Cause and in exalting the Word of God. This is God's irrevocable decree which hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. The loved ones in every city and region must appoint teachers from among their own people to give unto the servants the glad tidings of what hath appeared and shone forth. His honor 'Ali-Qabli-Haydar is also very good and acceptable for those parts. After reading this Tablet and hearing what is contained therein, send a copy thereof to the spiritual youth that he may be informed of what hath flowed from the Pen of the Lord of ancient days on this luminous night. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon them whom the cawing of the crows and the doubts of the suspicious have not kept back from God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00835 ===\n\n=== START BH00836 ===\n\nLet the honored Afnan, His Holiness Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], take note:He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!Praise, sanctified from all beginning and end, befitteth and beseemeth the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of that Eternal Being, Who, through the effulgent rays of the Sun of Yathrib and Batha, hath adorned the people of the mortal realm - who were deprived of knowledge and learning - with the ornament of wisdom, utterance, knowledge and understanding. His Will is the sovereign of all created wills, and His Purpose the ruler of the purposes of all servants. He hath illumined the world with the light of the Most Exalted Word, and by its penetrating power hath He subjugated all. Glorified be His grandeur, exalted be His might, glorified be His glory, magnificent be His proof, and all-encompassing be His testimony! And blessing and peace be upon the Lord of existence from the unseen and the visible, through Whom the ocean of utterance surged before the faces of all religions, and through Whom were manifested those stations that elevated humanity in the contingent world; and upon His family and companions, through whom flowed the Euphrates of mercy amongst all creatures and through whom was fulfilled the judgment of the Resurrection Hour - they who gave glad tidings to the servants of that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an through His exalted words: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the Worlds\" - blessings whose fragrance shall never cease throughout the duration of God's Kingdom, our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.And now, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your exile, your distress, and your homeland. This blessed word was heard from the Blessed Tongue - He said: \"His homeland is with Me and beneath the canopies of My loving-kindness. Praise be to God, and to Him belongs bounty, generosity, grandeur and glory.\" For repeatedly hath He mentioned that noble one with such words that were the hand of detachment to squeeze them, the water of life would flow therefrom. In any case, after reading and becoming informed, I proceeded to His presence and attained the honor of listening. His Word - may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him - the tongue of the realm of knowledge speaketh this exalted word: \"Verily the Divine Lote-Tree hath spoken the truth before all faces in the earliest of days, and hath mentioned its branches in such wise as hath rendered all pens impotent to describe. By the life of the Beloved! His profit and loss in all conditions returneth unto Us. This is a word that transformeth loss into the greatest profit, and it is the sun of utterances that hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of the Pen of grace and bounty. Blessed are those servants who have inhaled the fragrance of utterance and have attained unto that which God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, hath desired. O My Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness, and the grace of God and His mercy.\"The mention of you and those Afnan who are with you hath ever been and continues to be like the spring showers of divine mercy in the true springtime in this Most Great Prison. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for you every good that was in His Book and hidden in His knowledge. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Chosen One. Praise be to God! His grace encompasseth all and His loving-kindness accompanieth all. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nGlory be unto God! The successful, confirmed soul clearly and evidently beholdeth the traces of the universe and its fruits from the Most Exalted Pen. The world standeth bewildered at what hath been deposited therein, which no exhaustion can diminish. The door of its treasury hath been opened by the key of the will of our Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and at every moment the pearls of wisdom and utterance appear with such a radiance and shine with such a light that the true experts are powerless to enumerate and behold them. Glory be to our Goal, our Object of worship, our Beloved, and the Beloved of earth and heaven! In this field the steed of mention is bewildered and true understanding is thunderstruck. A hundred thousand blessings be upon those souls who have recognized the station of this Day, who have hearkened unto the Call, and who have attained, with most pure vision and illumined heart, unto the lights of the Most Great Scene. These are honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who act by His command.Another august letter arrived in the afternoon of Tuesday, bearing glad tidings of your health and well-being and that of the Son, upon him be the peace and glory of God. However, after reading and learning of its contents, grief came from one direction. Later, having repaired to the Holy Place and presented the matter before His presence, He said: \"In his loss there is profit, and in his harm there is benefit. We beseech God to make this very loss the essence of blessing and bounty. Verily, He is powerful over all things. O Afnan! Thou hast been and art with Us. Whatever befalleth, We are partners therein. Verily, He Who hath taken no partner unto Himself is God. We beseech Him to change hardship into ease, and difficulty into comfort. Verily, He is the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Goal of them that know.\"A hundred thousand thanks and praise unto the Goal of the world, Who hath aided thee to mention, extol, and serve His Cause. Every soul who hath passed by that direction hath, of his own accord and by his very essence, spoken in praise and glorification of the Afnan of the Sacred Tree, acknowledging and confessing His bounty. This is that blessing which hath had and hath no likeness or parallel. This evanescent servant, in the nights and days, beseecheth and imploreth the true Omnipotent One to manifest that which is the cause of the appearance of what He hath sent down in the Book. None can repel His command or prevent what He willeth. Verily, He is the Goal in the beginning and in the end.I convey greetings to the friends of Truth who are in the vicinity, and I seek for them that which is the cause of enduring mention. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Peace, remembrance, and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you, and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of our Lord, the Most Merciful.The Servant5 Dhi'l-Hajjih 1305152May my spirit be a sacrifice for your mention, your utterance, and your word! This petition was written some time ago in response to the blessed letter, but at the time of sending, the beloved of the heart, His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] the Most Glorious, informed that the vessel had departed. This day, which is Wednesday the 22nd of Dhi'l-Hajjih, another blessed letter arrived. Praise be to the Goal of the worlds that news of health and well-being, which is among the great divine bounties, has arrived and continues to arrive.\n\nAs regards what you wrote concerning Aqa 'Abdu'r-Rahim, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], they stated that things have transpired exactly as was wisest. His grace and favor are clear and evident, and all acknowledge this. Praise be to God Who confirmed and assisted you in that which would be remembered before Him and recorded by the Supreme Pen in the scriptures and tablets. They had mentioned before God the beloved and honored Ibn, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] the Most Glorious, and his expression of meekness. They stated: \"We beseech God to transform it into glory, power, wealth and exaltation. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and He is the Mighty, the Bestower.\" This evanescent servant hath beseeched and continueth to beseech, night and day, for that which is the cause of elevation, ascendancy, exaltation, glory and power. Verily our Lord is the Omnipotent, the Supreme, the All-Choosing. Then peace, praise, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who serve you for the sake of God.The Servant22 Dhi'l-?ijjih\n\n=== END BH00836 ===\n\n=== START BH00837 ===\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!Glorified art Thou, O my God! To whom shall I complain of what Thou hast done to me through Thy power and sovereignty, and to whom shall I mention what Thou hast caused to descend upon me through Thy might and authority? Thou art He Who hath taken my heart and left me in the valley of Thy separation, Who hath attracted my soul and cast me into the wilderness of separation from Thee. Thou art He Who, O my God, hath kindled my heart with Thy love, then forbidden me from beholding Thy beauty, and Who hath caused my heart to melt in passion and yearning for Thee, then prevented me from entering the sanctuary of Thy nearness and attaining Thy presence. I know not toward which direction to turn, nor with what voice to complain and recount what hath befallen me through the wonders of Thy decree in Thy days. O Lord, if I say Thou hearest not the cry of them that long for Thee in their separation and remoteness from Thee, all atoms testify to Thy knowledge and all-encompassing awareness; and if I say Thou knowest but showeth not mercy, my tongue, my reality, my soul and my limbs bear witness that Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. Therefore, O my Beloved, the wonders of Thy Cause, the operations of Thy decree and the manifestations of Thy determination have bewildered me.This is what a handmaiden among My handmaidens cried out in the tongue of her heart unto her Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Then her Beloved called unto her from the direction of His mighty throne, saying: O My handmaiden! Be thou fair in thy judgment regarding thyself and reflect upon that which hath befallen the Beloved of the worlds. Have I taken for Myself a house on My earth wherein I might dwell and summon unto it My loved ones and My handmaidens? Nay, by My grieving and mighty Self! Have I found for Myself a safe refuge whereon I might rest My feet and beneath whose shade Our accepted handmaidens and near servants might take shelter? I have been wronged at the hands of enemies in all days, and no day hath passed except that there descended upon Me that which causeth the hearts of the sincere ones to burn.\n\nO My handmaiden! The peoples of the earth have risen up against Me in malice, and behind them stand all who wield power. The realm of utterance hath been filled with their deeds. By God! Such harm hath been inflicted upon Me as hath caused the Eye of the All-Merciful to weep in the Ridvan of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. At this the tears have flowed from the eyes of the denizens of the highest Paradise, and then from the eyes of the sincere ones. This Bird hath been imprisoned in the cage of the horizons, while enemies have sought to harm Him, and even those of Our heedless servants who claim kinship.O My handmaiden! Reflect upon My Cause and what hath befallen Me in the path of My Beloved, after all the peoples rose up in opposition. My sister hath risen in opposition - she who hath done that which hath caused the letter Ta to weep in the Most Glorious Paradise, and the people of the Ridvan to lament, and then the Maids who dwell in the chambers of thy Lord's protection, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Love of the world hath so seized her that she hath clung to the most degraded of men and turned away from the Beloved of the worlds. By God! She hath done that which hath caused the Most Great Spirit and then the Faithful Spirit to lament. When she entereth the abode of the polytheists, she declareth: \"I have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds.\" And when she entereth the abode of the monotheists, she saith: \"I am the first handmaiden to believe in God, the Beloved of the worlds.\"O My sister! Didst thou desire by thy deeds to grieve My heart? By God! Nothing can affect it, for the All-Merciful hath established Himself upon it with manifest sovereignty. Even if all the handmaidens of the earth were to dwell in houses in My name, and thou wert to give them in marriage by thy hand to Mine enemies, this would not grieve My luminous heart. God hath made it the treasury of His revelation, the source of His knowledge, the dawning-place of His Cause, and the seat of His mighty throne. However, it grieveth Me that thou shouldst take pride in serving the polytheists and in thy association with them. This hath saddened My heart and the hearts of the sincere ones.O My sister! For what crime didst thou abandon Me and take those who have disbelieved in God, thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate? I desired thy good, while thou desired My grief. I have resigned My affair unto God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Whenever I reflect, nothing hath appeared from Me that would grieve thy heart. I know not what hath deluded thee concerning thy Lord, the Gracious. But yea, by My Lord, I know, and with Me is the knowledge of the heavens and the earths. That which was hidden in thy heart hath been manifested through what thou didst acquire beforehand. Thus doth God reveal the treachery of the eyes and what lieth within the breasts of the deceivers.O My handmaiden! Thus did My sister act, and the world deluded her until she disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Wise. We did not oppose her for Our own sake, but when she turned away from God, We turned away from her. Thus were We commanded by the One Who is the Powerful, the Ancient. We severed the ties of kinship between Us and her because she disbelieved in Him Who created her by His command, and God is witness to what I say. If any of My children should transgress the bounds of God, by God! My glance would never turn to him again - to this every fair-minded and informed one beareth witness.O My handmaiden! Guard thyself lest kinship prevent thee from God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Sever the ties of kinship from all who claim kinship, and hold fast to the kinship of God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. By God! Through His kinship, souls become independent of the kinship of all the worlds. By My life, O My handmaiden! If thou shouldst find the sweetness of detachment, thou wouldst detach thyself in the path of the Beloved, and neither worldly kinship nor its ornaments would prevent thee from turning to the face of God, the King, the Mighty, the Great. Thus it behooveth Our devoted handmaidens and \\[Our\\] detached servants. We have severed the ties of kinship from all who claim kinship, except from those who have believed in God and turned away from the polytheists. O My servants! Should any one of you hear that his brother or sister hath turned away from God, it behooveth him to turn away from that one and to turn towards the Beloved of the sincere ones.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Withhold not from my brothers and sisters the breezes through which Thou didst quicken the hearts of them that have recognized Thee, nor the sweet fragrances of Thy days wherein the Sun of Thy beauty hath shone forth upon all mankind. O my God, all Thy servants are in Thy grasp; none can find stability when the winds of trials blow, nor can any find repose when the manifestations of temptation appear. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Healer of the hearts of them that yearn after Thee, to preserve Thy male and female servants from the promptings of self and passion, that all may turn toward the direction of Thy mercy, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of decree and the kingdom of ordainment. Verily, Thou doest what Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the All-Wise.O my God! My sister hath forgotten Thee and turned away from Thee, and the world hath so moved her that she hath spoken concerning the Manifestation of Thyself that which hath caused the tears to flow from the eyes of them that are nigh unto Thee and hath burned the hearts of the Messengers. O Lord! If she hath any good deeds in Thy presence, cause her to return unto Thee and purify the atmosphere of her heart from the clouds of self and desire, and sanctify her from the world and all that hath been created therein, that she may hold fast unto Thee and be severed from them who have disbelieved in God on a day whereon all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy beauty whereby the earth and the heavens were illumined, and by Thy name through which the verses were sent down and the idols of fancy and allusion were shattered, to preserve Thy male and female servants from all that may withhold them from Thy love and Thy good-pleasure. Then assign unto them a seat of truth in Thy Most Exalted Paradise. Verily Thou art God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Gracious.\n\n=== END BH00837 ===\n\n=== START BH00838 ===\n\nThis is what hath flowed from the tongue of might and power when Nabil cast himself upon the dust outside the city before the prison, the seat of his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise:In the name of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High!Glorified art Thou, O my God! The veils of such of Thy servants as have disbelieved in Thy signs have come between Thee and Thy creation. How many, O my God, are the servants who stand before the gate of the prison and are prevented from entering the sanctuary of Thy nearness, and how many are the chosen ones who circle round Thy city out of love for Thee yet find no way to the Dayspring of the glory of Thy oneness! Among them is Nabil, O my God, who entered the city but found no path unto Thee, that he might enter the pavilion of Thy majesty and the court of Thy glorious oneness. The oppressors have prevented him from entering into Thy presence and from dwelling beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy Cause. He would circle the prison in these days out of love for Thee until Satan discovered him and informed the people. Then did they expel him from the city, and no sooner had the days passed than separation seized from his hand the reins of patience and he was consumed by the fire of yearning. Therefore did he seek once again the precincts of Paradise. Thou seest him, O my God, when prevented from entering, standing in the open space outside the city at a far distance, then turning toward the seat of Thy mighty throne and facing Thy countenance, standing before Thy face with such submission that all things in the kingdom of creation bow down before it, his tears flowing, his sighs ascending, his limbs trembling, his members quaking, and his tongue speaking:O Lord! Thou seest me keeping company with the beasts in Thy love, having forsaken cities and lands in Thy path, detaching myself from all directions save the direction of Thy grace, and entering into the precincts of Thy mercy. O Lord! Thou didst reveal to me Thy beauty, then by Thy firm decree prevented me from beholding it. Thou didst give me to drink of the water of Thy presence, then afflicted me with separation from Thee. Thou didst honor me with Thy nearness, then distanced me through what flowed from the Pen of Thy decree upon the tablets inscribed by the Pen of Thy Command. Thou knowest, O my God, that Thy love hath consumed me, Thy separation hath dissolved me, and from being parted from Thee my bones and limbs are set ablaze. By Thy glory, O Beloved of the worlds, Goal of them that know Thee, and God of all in the heavens and earths! I cannot endure to be patient at the manifestation of Thy chosen Name. If Thou didst desire separation, why didst Thou call me to intimate communion? And if Thou didst ordain for me to burn in separation from Thee, why didst Thou show me the Light of Thy countenance whereby the horizons were illumined? I am certain with the certainty of knowledge, O my God, that with Thee is the water of everlasting life - to whom shall I turn, O Lord of all possibility and King of the worlds? And with Thee is the kingdom of eternity - to whom shall I face, O my Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious? By Thy glory, O my Beloved! The remembrance of Thee is my life, Thy praise the utterance of my tongue, meeting Thee my hope, nearness to Thee my desire and the ultimate goal of my wish and aspiration. I can bear all afflictions, but I cannot bear separation from Thee. I can detach myself from every delight in Thy love, but I cannot be patient in separation from Thee, O Beloved of the hearts of them that are enchanted and Beloved of the hearts of them that yearn! My joy is in Thy nearness and meeting Thee, my sustenance is Thy melodies, my spirit Thy verses, my companion Thy remembrances, and my origin Thy words. Decree for me what Thou willest through Thy command, but ordain for me Thy nearness. Burn me with the fire of Thy dominion, then prescribe for me to meet Thee. By Thy glory! My thirst will not be quenched save by the Kawthar of Thy revelation before Thy face, and my heart will not find rest except by gazing upon Thy beauty. Thus hast Thou created me by Thy power and brought me into being by Thy command. Would that I were a breeze passing through Thy court or \\[...\\] I soared as a bird in the atmosphere of my imprisonment even though, O my God, from my words wafted the odors of those who commit transgressions among Thy creatures. But my love for Thee hath seized the reins of propriety from my hands. Thy forgiveness requireth that Thou shouldst not take me to task for my utterances and my misdeeds.I beseech Thee, O Creator of the nations and Quickener of moldering bones, to lift away the veil through Thy power and to lead forth the loved ones from this prison through Thy grace and bounty. Then cause those who seek Thee to enter beneath Thy shadow. By Thy glory! I know that the suspicious actions of Thy creatures have prevented us from meeting Thee, and the heedlessness of Thy servants hath come between us and the lights of Thy countenance. Forgive, O my God, their transgressions which have prevented us from drawing nigh unto the ocean of Thy reunion and from arriving beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy favors.Wilt Thou, O my God, take those who long for Thee to task for what the heedless have wrought? I beseech Thee, O Life of the worlds, to send down from the clouds of Thy heaven of grace that which will conceal the hearts of Thy loved ones and gather them around Thee through Thy bounty.Alas! Alas! How many servants dwelt beneath the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree, yet their eyes never once fell upon it! And how many servants reposed in the precincts of Thy supreme mercy, yet paid no heed to it! O my God! By Thy glory, the wonders of Thy Cause and the mysteries of Thy decree have bewildered me. How many servants tasted death in their separation from Thee and attained not Thy presence, and how many servants desired not Thy nearness, yet Thy decree brought them into Thy presence and granted them reunion with Thee!Alas! Alas! By this my liver and the livers of Thy lovers are consumed. Would that no mortal eye had ever fallen upon Thy most pure Countenance save the eye of him who seeth naught but Thee and desireth none but Thee! I, O my God, hope in all circumstances to be but earth for Thy feet to tread upon, yet I think there may be among Thy servants one who drinks the cup of reunion while remaining heedless of Thy presence.All this, O my God, proceedeth from the manifestations of Thy providence and wisdom. By them my soul is troubled and my heart lamenteth, for I comprehend not the mysteries of Thy decree nor know I what lieth hidden in the treasuries of Thy knowledge. Since this is so, it behooveth me to detach myself from my desires in all that I ask of Thee. I know not, O my Goal, whether what I love and desire will profit or harm me. Therefore, O my God, I find no refuge and no retreat save in committing my cause unto Thee and detaching myself from all that I desire, saying at all times: \"I have placed my trust in Thee, O God of those who are in the heavens and on earth!\"O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy beauty to make me steadfast in this, that I may be content with Thy decree to such extent that what I choose be what Thou hast chosen, and my hope be what Thou hast manifested. By Thy Self, O my God! Thy tribulation hath made me forget mine own tribulation, and Thy imprisonment hath made me neglectful of mine own affliction. Alas for my sorrow! This is a station wherein mention faileth, the pen is forbidden, eyes are blinded, expression falleth short, and explanation proveth powerless.My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy love, O Lord of the worlds! Thou hast borne for us what neither the mountains, nor the seas, nor the heavens and earth could bear, and Thou hast borne these tribulations only for the life of the world, yet the world hateth Thee. I know not what lieth behind the veil of Thy knowledge, O Hope of the worlds!I know, O my God, that Thy Will prevaileth over the world, Thy Purpose ruleth the will of all created things, and Thy Power encompasseth all who are in the heavens and on earth. The deeds of the oppressors cannot prevent Thee from Thy Cause, nor can the turning away of those who have turned aside. I beseech Thee to aid Thy loved ones, then make them steadfast in Thy love and Thy good-pleasure, then make their hearts assured that the oppression of those who have disbelieved in Thy signs may not cause them to stumble. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over all that Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the dominion of the seen and unseen. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Loving.\n\n=== END BH00838 ===\n\n=== START BH00839 ===\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Witnessing from the Most Exalted HorizonA Book We have sent down in truth, wherein We make mention of the party of God who have held fast to My firm cord.

The glory be upon thee, upon thy wife, and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords.O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! The Lord of all beings makes mention of thee from the prison precinct, even as He mentioned thee before with clear verses. Give thanks unto thy Lord Who created thee and aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and the Source of His inspiration, Who speaks before the faces of all nations in the world: \"Verily, there is none other God but I, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\"O Muhammad-Qabli-Isma'il! The All-Glorious makes mention of thee when the heedless had imprisoned Him in the prison of 'Akka, inasmuch as He summoned all to the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire and arisen to serve God, the Lord of all worlds.O Muhammad-Qabli-Ibrahim! Upon thee be the glory of God and His mercy. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that is from Him, then recite it unto those on whose faces thou seest the radiance of the All-Merciful and on whose foreheads is the seal \"we are all God's, the Mighty, the Loving.\" Be thou steadfast in such wise that the cawing of the polytheists who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen, will not cause thee to slip. The glory be upon thee, upon thy wife and thy daughter, and upon those who have arisen and said: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of all that was and shall be.\"O Hasan! The Lord of the hidden and the manifest makes mention of thee and informs thee of a cawer who shall appear there through the promptings of those who have violated God's Covenant and His Testament and have disbelieved in this clear proof. We have recognized what thou didst desire in My path and have accepted thy deed, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all that is seen and unseen, and the Lord of the mighty throne. We have lifted the decree of holy war and forbidden the people of God from fighting and from that which might grieve the hearts of those who have believed in God, the One, the Chosen.We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-Baqir and counsel him to manifest great steadfastness, for the enemies have arisen with a new scheme. Hold thou fast unto the sure handle and cling to My luminous robe.O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Aqajan and remind him of the days of thy Lord, His verses, His clear proofs, and that which hath appeared from Him. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is he who hath been set ablaze today with the fire of My love and hath arisen to serve My wondrous Cause.O Muhammad-Qabli-Sadiq! Hearken unto the call which hath been raised beyond the crimson sea at the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary on the right side of the luminous spot: \"Verily, there is none other God but I, the Speaker, the All-Knowing.\" The people have acknowledged His sovereignty and power through His word \"He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and shall not be asked of His doings, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\" They acknowledge what hath been sent down in truth, yet in every matter they say \"why\" and \"wherefore.\" They are indeed among the perishing ones. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the hearts of the deniers may be made to tremble.\n\nO My loved one! Soon shalt thou hear the utterances of the idolaters who have violated My Covenant and Testament, denied My days, and disputed My signs.

Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Qablih-Karim, and remind him of that which hath befallen thee at the hands of the oppressors. They have denied Him Who hath come unto them with that which equaleth all that was revealed aforetime and thereafter. Verily, they are in manifest doubt. Beware lest the doubts of the world hold thee back from the Most Great Name. Leave behind what is with the peoples, hoping for that which is with God, the Mighty, the Great.O Muhammad-Qablih-Baqir! The All-Bountiful remembereth thee from the quarter of His Most Great Name, and counseleth thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of creation. Blessed is the servant whom the veils of glory have not withheld from God, the Lord of all beings. Woe unto them who have turned away from the Countenance, fixing their gaze upon idle fancies and vain imaginings. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon thy son who hath been named Hasan in this Spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of His signs.O Abu'l-Qasim! There hath come unto thee the Most Great Book which hath been detailed from the Mother Book by God, the Lord of Lords. Take it in My Name and remind the servants of My days through My utterance, that the people may emerge from darkness into light and give them the glad-tidings of the days of God. Say: O concourse of the earth! By God, the Day hath come which was mentioned in the Books of God and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the servant who hath turned unto Him and recognized his final abode and destination. Be thou steadfast in such wise that neither the tempests of the divines nor the hurricanes of princes shall move thee. Thus doth My Pen counsel thee at its beginning and its end.O Fadlu'llah! Be thou firm as the mountain, steadfast as a stake, and independent in thy Lord's Cause, the Lord of the Final End. Beware lest human affairs hold thee back from the Lord of Destiny. Hold fast unto His cord. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast made me to know Thee, taught me, and guided me unto Thy manifest and evident path. O Qasim-'Ali! The Dayspring of inner meanings remembereth thee from the horizon of utterance and counseleth thee with that whereby the face of the Cause will be illumined amongst the servants. Be firm and be thou of them that are steadfast.

Hear the call in the Return from the Mother Book. He mentions thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto the One, the All-Informed. Say: This is the Day wherein the call hath been raised from every direction, and the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath spoken forth on the Mount of Knowledge: \"Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\" I have manifested My Self as a bounty from Me, and fulfilled what I promised in My perspicuous Book. We make mention of those whose names were not mentioned before the Face, and We give them glad tidings of God's loving kindness and mercy, and of that which hath been ordained for them by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book, which none hath discovered save God, the Lord of this luminous Day. O My loved ones! Be ye of such constancy that the clamoring of the croakers shall not keep you back from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The croaking hath been raised from every quarter, and this is what We foretold unto you in Zawra and in the Land of Mystery and in this mighty Prison. Ibn-i-Abhar hath appeared before the Greatest Scene and made mention of those who have believed in the presence of the Face, and We have revealed unto them the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have aided him through Our command that he may draw men nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Blessed is he who heareth from him that which he uttereth concerning this momentous Announcement and this noble Edifice. O Ibn-i-Abhar! Remind My loved ones on My behalf and adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness, lest their feet slip and their hearts be troubled by the intimations of the ignorant ones of the Bayan, even as the doubts of the divines of the Qur'an held back those servants who turned unto God, the True King, the Manifest. Say: Take ye the chalice of eternity in My Most Great Name, then drink therefrom, detached from the kingdom of names and whatsoever hath been created in the realm of creation. Thus doth command you He with Whom is the Mother Book and that which was hidden from the eyes of those who are in the heavens and on earth. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O people of God, and upon those whom the scourge of the oppressors, the rifles of the deniers, and the cannons of the idolaters did not frighten.

Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy, which have preceded existence, both seen and unseen, and which have been sent down from the heaven of My grace. Thy letter which thou didst send to the Trustee, upon him be the bounty of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath come before the Wronged One, and He hath heard thy call and hath answered thee with that which causeth all things to speak. By God! The gate of utterance hath been opened through that which the Mother Book hath pronounced at its final end. We make mention of the Amir and give him the glad-tidings that We have accepted the Trustee as a representative on his behalf. We proceeded from the place named Bahji to the spot called Junayn, and with the Divine Lote-Tree were its branches and twigs, then those who circled round the Throne of God, the Lord of all worlds. Each one of them attained unto the presence and the meeting, rejoicing in the bounty of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.O 'Abdu'l-Husayn! The Kingdom of God hath at this moment turned toward thee as a bounty from His presence and hath made mention of thee with that wherewith the heaven hath called out. Blessed is he who hath turned toward it and hath attained unto the hearing of the remembrance of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.O Baha'u'llah! Thy letter hath come time and again before the face of the Wronged One. We have answered thee with that which hath cooled the eyes of them that know, and We have mentioned thee each time, detached from pen and ink. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.O Isma'il! Thou beholdest the Sacrifice of God in this day walking before the people and speaking: \"Verily there is none other God but I, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" He hath been sacrificed time and again through that which the hands of those who associate themselves with Him have wrought, while they commit that which hath caused the eye of God to weep in His exalted station. We have mentioned thee before with that which the Tablet hath testified and which God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, hath written. Rejoice in that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and hath sent down for thee that which hath perfumed the earth with the fragrance of the All-Merciful. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.O Muhammad-Baqir! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, in that He hath aided thee to turn unto Him, and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of all existence, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou the Possessor of proof and evidence!

Say: My spirit be a sacrifice to Thy loving-kindness, O Thou Who hast aided me to turn unto Thee, shown me the traces of Thy Pen, and caused me to hear Thy call! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy mercy to strengthen me in steadfastness in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent.O Ghulam-Rida! Blessed is the gathering wherefrom My remembrance and praise have been raised, blessed the house honored by the arrival of My loved ones, and blessed the tongue that hath uttered My verses. We have manifested that which was treasured in knowledge and hidden in the stronghold of God's protection, illumining this radiant horizon. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear, to see, and to speak forth Thy remembrance on the Day of Judgment.O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! We testify that thou hast attained unto the mention of God, both before and after. He mentioneth whomsoever He willeth with a mention that causeth bodies to rise from the graves of idle fancies. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desires and taken hold of guidance in the days of God, the Lord of lords. I bear witness that thou hast heard, turned unto Him, and attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of days. Know thou this most exalted station, then preserve it in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One.O Husayn! The polytheists have violated God's covenant and His testament, and have denied His proof and His evidence, following every heedless doubter. Say: O people of the earth! Hearken! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, desireth to give you glad tidings of that which will draw you nigh, profit you, and make you rich in His dominion. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the ocean of grace. Hasten unto the Dawning-Place of your Lord's verses, the Revealer of clear evidences. Say:Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for that which hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen in my name, which neither the treasuries of princes can equal, nor that which lay hidden in the earth. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book from Thy presence. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, submissive before Thy Manifestation and Thy sovereignty. Ordain for me that which will aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to cling to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Help in Peril.O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention once again of Thy servant who hath been named Baha, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. We have mentioned thee before with verses before which the world hath bowed down in submission. Blessed is the ear that hath been honored to hear them and hath been illumined by their light. Verily, thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He loveth him who hath loved Him, remembereth him who hath remembered Him, and sendeth down for whomsoever He willeth that which will draw him nigh unto His hallowed and wondrous court. Say:Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Heart's Desire, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Creator and Provider, for having remembered me in Thy days, once in the Tablet and again in the Book. I beseech Thee, O Beloved of the world, by Thy Most Great Name, to render me known through Thy Name and eloquent in Thy praise. Verily, Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Thou hast prescribed for Thyself to answer him who calleth upon Thee, to aid him who holdeth fast unto Thee, and to bestow Thy bounty when asked. Have mercy on this servant of Thine and ordain for him that which will gladden his heart, solace his eyes, and enable him to call out among Thy servants through Thy Name, the Mighty, the Ancient.\n\nThis Tablet hath ended in thy name as a token of My favor unto thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Generous. We wish to make mention of the Leaf whom We named in the Crimson Book as the Leaf of Paradise. Blessed is she! We bear witness that she hath believed in her Lord and hath attained in these days unto that which was withheld from the women of the earth, save those who turned unto God and believed in the One, the All-Informed, and who circled round the Throne at eventide and at dawn, at daybreak and at dusk.O Ruhani! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness. We have made mention of thee in My Books, My Scriptures and My Tablets. My mercy which hath preceded thee and My loving-kindness which hath surrounded thee bear witness to this, and I am verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate, the Most Generous. We counsel thee and My handmaidens to manifest such virtues as shall waft the fragrance of My Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The Glory of God rest upon you, O My handmaidens, and upon those who have heard the Call and answered their Lord, the Lord of the Exalted Throne. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of all mystics and the Beloved of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00840 ===\n\n=== START BH00841 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His Glory!O manifestation of God's truthfulness in truth and creation, Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad Sadiq, consider this:Although for some time no breeze of loving-kindness has wafted from your direction upon this lowly one's heart, and the pen of affection has not inscribed this evanescent one's name, yet this servant, in accordance with \"the believers are one soul, one spirit, and one body,\" has observed degrees of love and unity within myself and you. Thus have I regarded you in like manner, until in these days Jinab-i-Shaykh Ruhullah - may his spirit be sanctified - turned his face toward the Beloved and attained the presence of the Desired One before the Throne, along with two others: Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali Akbar and Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Ashraf. When the appointed time for their sojourn near the mercy of the Gracious Sovereign was completed and permission for return was sent down from the heaven of divine will, this servant deemed it necessary to make mention of himself to your presence through this letter, so that the degrees of love concealed in the heart might be made manifest in the visible realm, and the inner might be adorned with the garment of the outer, and the outer with the ornament of the inner.For the Beloved, the All-Glorious, has ever wished that all the deeds of those who consider themselves related to Truth should be fully manifested in action - that is, whatever proceeds from them should be befitting both outward matters and inward conditions, that their outer might indicate their inner state and their inner state their outer condition. And thereafter, were this servant to attempt to mention the calamities that have befallen and the afflictions that have descended in this land upon the Beauty of Divine Unity, he would surely find himself incapable and would only increase your grief. Therefore, this servant has not engaged in such mentions and has left it to those returning, that they might surely convey, according to their capacity, what they have understood. However, I submit to your presence that it is evident to your honor that these days have had and will have no likeness, similitude, or equal. It is incumbent upon every soul to spare no effort, according to their capacity, in establishing the divine Cause and proclaiming the Manifestation of the glory of the Eternal, and to strive with all their powers to assist the Cause, which is pure teaching.What more can I say about the veiling of some, despite the Sun of Glory's acceptance having shone forth from the holy horizon of majesty in such wise that it has encompassed all the world and appeared with perfect power and sovereignty? Yet some have clung to vain imaginings and remained far from recognizing the Beauty of the All-Knowing Sovereign. What regret for such souls! Despite the healing counsels and conclusive admonitions that have been sent down from the Source of Divine Unity in the revealed scriptures, they are seen to be more remote than previous nations and more heedless than all who dwell on earth. One must at all times take refuge in God, that perhaps through His encompassing novel favors and His extended mercy, He may not deprive these servants from the shore of ancient glory and may establish them firmly upon the path of His Cause, which today encompasses all the world.At this moment it is revealed from the right of the Throne: Write to the remnant of God's people on earth: O My manifestation of truth! If you are reclining, raise your head, and if you are sitting, arise at the mention of My Name, and if thou art standing, soar with the love of My Beauty, and if thou art soaring, ascend by the power of My might, and if thou art ascending, pause in thy place in the atmosphere of the Spirit by the sovereignty of My Cause. Then open thy lips through My Name the Opener, then move thy tongue through My Name the Mover, then speak in My melody: Say: O concourse of earth and heaven! By God the Truth, the King of eternity hath appeared and hath shone forth from the horizon of creation with His most exalted sovereignty. Then He changed the garment of His Name and appeared with His Most Glorious Name above the Most Exalted Horizon - the Station round which circle the Kingdom of Names and Attributes. O people! If ye desire to witness the power of God, behold His power that hath encompassed all things; if ye desire to see the sovereignty of God, behold His sovereignty that hath conquered all things; if ye seek to observe the mercy of God, behold His mercy that hath preceded all things; if ye desire to look upon the greatness of God and His dominion, turn your gaze to His greatness that hath been established over all things; if ye desire to hear His melodies, then hearken to His Word that hath been created by His command and hath been raised above all things; if ye desire to be honored by His presence, by God, this is His Beauty that hath been manifested unto all things. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of the Ancient of Days at this time. Hearken then unto that which hath been revealed unto thee, then convey it to the servants that they may purify themselves from the defilement of idle fancies and attain unto the station that hath been ordained for them. Thus hath the Pen of Command enjoined thee at this time from the presence of God, the Almighty, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.Therefore, O manifestation of My truthfulness, strive that thou mayest appear in the earth in accordance with this Name. The truthfulness that is beloved in the sight of God is that thou shouldst arise to praise His Being and occupy thyself with the mention of His Cause, for no truth can equal the Word wherewith God speaketh. Blessed, therefore, are they who attain unto this most exalted and glorious station. For truthfulness there are countless stations ordained with God that cannot be contained in this leaf. Among these stations is the truthfulness that is known among men. Having attained unto this station, as God willing thou hast, it behooveth thee to make a mighty effort that thou mayest attain unto and be sustained by the Most Great Truth that circleth round the Most Great Scene. Well is it with them that attain thereunto. Here endeth the words of God.This servant at the end of this petition submitteth that God willing thou wilt ever be occupied with the mention of the Beloved in such wise that its influence may become manifest throughout all the world. There is no word but hath an effect with thy Lord. Thus hath it been ordained by the Mighty, the Ancient. I beseech God that I may be blessed with attaining thy presence that I may convey, without tongue or utterance, the hidden secrets and concealed mysteries.Convey, on behalf of this servant, expressions of sincere praise in sublime and glorious terms to his honor the son who hath been the object of the regard of God, exalted be His glory. The degrees of this servant's love for that exalted person are too evident to be described by mention or proven by utterance. God is aware of what is in my heart and He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Moreover, remember with infinite mention from this servant the other loved ones of that land - those who have drunk from the cup of detachment and been sustained by the chalice of oneness. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, then upon them all.Abdullah, the servant of His loved ones,Aqa Jan\n\n=== END BH00841 ===\n\n=== START BH00842 ===\n\nIn the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most High, the All-Glorious!Praise be to God Who hath manifested through His Most Glorious Name unto all who dwell on earth and in heaven.

He is, verily, the Lord of creation and the Sovereign over all servants. He is the One by Whom the trumpet was sounded, and by Whom were thunderstruck the people of idle fancies who cast the Command of God behind their backs and followed the bidding of every ignorant one who turned away from God, the Mighty, the Bestower. I pray and offer salutations upon those whom the affairs of creation did not withhold from the Truth, who turned away from vain imaginings and idle fancies, who advanced toward the horizon of certitude, and who arose to serve the Cause in such wise that through them the fragrance of His raiment was wafted throughout all creation. These are honored servants upon whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names do confer their blessings. We beseech God, the Lord of all mankind, to gather us beneath their shadow and honor us with their service and their remembrance. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.The petition of this evanescent one to your honor is this: Your revered letter dated the 5th of Dhi'l-Qa'dih arrived. God knoweth that it brought joy to mine eyes, gladness to my heart, and delight to my breast. In each of its words there seemed to be concealed an ocean of love and the wine of affection, inasmuch as it was adorned with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. Blessed art thou and blessed am I. After reading and learning of its contents, it happened that this evanescent servant was that very night present before His countenance, and all that you had written was presented. This is what shone forth from the horizon of utterance in reply:\"Thy letter hath come before Us, and We have heard from it thy call, thy remembrance, and thy praise, and have answered thee with that which the treasures of the earth cannot equal. He Who possesseth knowledge of the Book beareth witness to this. Blessed art thou for having left thy homeland out of love for God, the Knower of the seen and unseen. He shall surely reward thee with the most excellent of rewards through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Be thou a herald of His Name with wisdom and utterance, that perchance the people of the world may cast away what they possess and turn toward God, the Revealer of verses. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard thy words concerning this Cause whereby hearts have been perturbed and eyes have been transfixed. God willing, with perfect joy and delight engage in the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. Guide those who are far removed unto the horizon of nearness, and lead those who thirst unto the Salsabil of divine knowledge. This is a day wherein whatsoever occurreth, the remembrance thereof shall endure and persist. Well is it with the soul that hath attained unto these days and recognized what hath been manifested therein of the signs of its Lord and the revelations of its Creator.

God willing, he will attain to it. Convey greetings on behalf of this ephemeral one to him. God willing, may he be assisted to render such service whose effects shall remain permanent and enduring in the world. And likewise to Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God - praise be to God that he has attained the greatest bounty and has been honored with that which was intended. God willing, may he ever be occupied with that which befits these days.As to what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Hakim Khayru'd-Din, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented. He said: Write: \"O Hakim! The disease of darkness has overtaken the people of the world and cast them all upon the bed of frustration. God willing, through the Supreme Remedy, which is the Name of the Ancient King, you shall heal them all and deliver them from this chronic malady. This is not difficult for God. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of Truth that if a soul should arise today for the sake of God to serve the Cause with wisdom and utterance, his soul will surely prove influential. Thus doth the Wronged One mention thee in this Great Prison. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy son and upon all who have turned to God, the Lord of the worlds.\" End quote.Regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Imtiyaz Husayn Sahib, his details were presented. The Sun of Grace shone forth from the horizon of Will. He said: Write: \"O Husayn! God willing, may you at all times drink from the Kawthar of divine love and soar in the atmosphere of acceptance and affection. The world will soon return to nothingness, and that which remains permanent and enduring is the word of acceptance that appears from the Pen of the Manifestation of God's Cause. God willing, with utmost endeavor may you speak in remembrance of the Peerless Friend and remain firm and steadfast in His Cause.\" End quote. To each of these gentlemen, mention this servant's evanescence and nothingness, which depends on their favors.Concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Siyyid Ali Akbar, verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, He is the All-Knowing, the Witness, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. Most people are heedless and unaware of God's knowledge and all-encompassing power. We beseech God to grant him a hearing ear that he may hear and act upon the Most Sublime Words and Greatest Counsel that have flowed from the Supreme Pen.As for recent news, one Sheikh Ubaydullah, a Kurdish man, has rebelled against the Ottoman government and raised the banner of opposition. Fifteen thousand people have gathered around him and he has plundered the Ottoman border regions. These days he has turned toward Iran and has pillaged Nab and Savujbulagh - that is, they have killed the men and taken the women and girls captive. Things have occurred that cannot be mentioned. Today, which is the last day of the blessed Feast of Sacrifice, Jinab-i-Mulla Abu'l-Hasan-i-Ardikani, upon him be the Glory of God, has written these details to this ephemeral servant. In any case, according to reports, the people of Tabriz are also in utmost turmoil. What else will appear later, God knows best. The Glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and those who love you and hear your words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.In the Pilgrimage season of the year 1297\n\n=== END BH00842 ===\n\n=== START BH00843 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most GloriousPraise be to God Who created water through His utterance manifest in the Kingdom of immortality. Then He gazed upon it, and it trembled within itself, and a portion of it was frozen. Thereupon the dusty earth appeared through His decree established in the realm of origination. When they separated and divided, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke another word. Then that water, brought into being through the Will manifest in creation through the essence of possibility, moved upon that earth brought into existence through the will of the All-Merciful. And there rose from them both a subtle, spiritual, luminous heat by its power to the highest rank, that it might attain to that station wherein the tongue of its Lord, the Most Glorious, speaks. When it reached the ultimate station, it paused in that most exalted place which is mentioned in creation as the highest sphere. Then the water mixed partially with the earth, and another heat rose from them both, and due to its weakness it did not reach the first one and halted at another station which is known as the second sphere. And likewise heat rose from them time after time until the stations known as the spheres were complete. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke another word, and thereby the stations and spheres began to revolve, and from the intensity of revolution a light shone forth and was transformed into a dome over the face of heaven. Then brilliant stars and luminous planets appeared. When the dominion of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, encompassed them from all directions, each one of them became circular as can be seen in the sun and moon. Exalted is the All-Powerful, the Wise Creator Who made His exalted Word the source of creation of all things above and below, the four elements, and the sublime natures brought into being. I testify that He is verily the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Strong, the Mighty.My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy love! This evanescent servant was occupied with transcribing what was revealed from the heaven of revelation when there was a knock at the door and someone brought a sealed letter. I took it and opened it and saw a letter sealed with the name of God's name, the Mahdi - upon him be all His most glorious glory. In his letter was a letter from your honor. I took it and read it and found therein the fragrance of your love for God, the Lord of all worlds, and the fragrance of your steadfastness in His firm and wise Cause. I presented it before the Throne in the first hour of the night and laid it before our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is what was revealed from the direction of the Throne:\"O H.S.! Thy letter hath come and the servant present before the Throne hath read it. We found from it the fragrance of the love of God and the Dawning-Place of His Cause, and We have revealed for thee these verses that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness and for having aided the Cause of thy Lord when most of the ignorant ones turned away from it. We have sent down for thee aforetime a tablet, then after it another tablet, then after it another tablet, then by the hand of the Trustworthy One radiant and resplendent tablets more brilliant than the light of the sun at noontide. Beware lest the affairs of the deniers make thee sorrowful. Be thou occupied with the remembrance of thy Lord in all conditions. Verily He is with thee and will aid thee with truth and will protect thee from those who have denied the beginning and the return. Blessed art thou, then blessed art thou, then blessed art thou for having been faithful to God's Covenant and His Testament and for having been mindful of His Name among those who cast guidance behind their backs and chose error for themselves. The glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among the women and the men.\"Here endeth the divine revelation. What more can this servant say about what hath shone forth from the Dayspring of divine favors and what hath issued forth from the Source of heavenly bounties? The mute tongue is not capable of mentioning this station. Verily He is the Speaker, the All-Knowing.\n\nAlso, a Tablet has been sent down from the heaven of Will especially for the Leaf - upon her be \\[Baha'u'llah's glory\\] - who is in your presence, and likewise a Tablet requested for one of the handmaidens of God was sent down from the heaven of grace. What else can this servant say about how much bounty was shown when your letter was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence? The Beloved smiled greatly at your words, and likewise all the holy women of the household send their most wondrous greetings to you and to the Leaf. In truth, you have been and continue to be the extinguisher of the fire of the hatred of the deniers and the destroyer of the calumnies of the polytheistic men and women. Victory has been and will always be with you. Praise be to God for confirming you in dispelling the suspicions of every polytheist and rending asunder the veil of every polytheistic woman. Verily, He assists whom He wishes with authority from His presence. He is truly the Mighty, the Powerful.And regarding what you again wrote about the exalted verse \"Verily the Ta' in Valaj\" etc., it was presented before His Presence. He said the meaning of that verse is that when the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - appeared in the land of Sh, the croaking of a croaker was inevitable, and the meaning of Valaj was the turmoil of that land and the events that occurred therein, including the presence of the Wondrous One with a glorious Tablet.Regarding the prayer requested for Aqa Mir Siyyid 'A.B. - upon him be the glory of God - it was previously sent together with Amin - upon him be \\[Baha'u'llah's glory\\], the King of manifest justice. God willing, they have received it. Convey wondrous and glorious greetings on behalf of this servant to them.And regarding the permission they requested for reading prayers and supplications and giving permission for others to read them, it was presented and He said: \"We have given you permission for this as a bounty from Us and We will assist you as We please. Verily Our grace has encompassed you. Be thankful and among those who praise.\"And regarding what was written about the science of letters and the Hidden, what was revealed was a treatise on the science of the Temple sent down from the heaven of the Lord of Causes specifically for you.And regarding the matter of the Hidden, everything is dependent on its appointed time. We beseech God to assist you in this and to manifest through you what He desires. He is truly the Strong, the Mighty. That Persian treatise which was sent to you, by your life, contains everything related to this science. Reflect a little and you will attain to God's purpose.And regarding Aqa Mirza Fadlu'llah, details were mentioned but he has not yet made any mention. Whatever he wishes will certainly be presented.And regarding what you wrote at the end of the letter about visitation, this servant presented himself before the Throne with your intention and circumambulated and visited on your behalf, and it was a very pleasant occasion, praise be to God in all conditions.The Two Most Great and Most Exalted Branches - may my spirit and the spirit of all the worlds be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - send most wondrous, most holy greetings.And regarding the greetings you conveyed to Nabil and the name of \\[God\\] the Generous - upon them be the glory of God - now this servant conveys their greetings to you and will later convey your greetings to them. They are all truly mindful in your remembrance. May the Glory be upon you all.Convey infinite greetings from this evanescent servant to all the loved ones in that land.The Servant\n\n23 Muharram 1291\n\n=== END BH00843 ===\n\n=== START BH00844 ===\n\nGlory be to God Who hath gladdened the servant through the fragrances of His loved ones' utterances--they who have cast away the world and have arisen to serve the nations by His command, for He is the All-Ruling, the All-Compelling. O beloved of my heart! Blessed be thy essence, blessed be thy remembrance, blessed be thy steadfastness, and blessed be thy devotion. The servant hath been honored by your mention, your praise, your utterance, your service, and that which hath flowed from your pen in the Cause of God--our purpose and your purpose. By the life of the Beloved! Such rapture and longing hath seized me that every tongue is powerless to describe it. To this beareth witness the tongue of my heart and my inmost being, and beyond these He Who hath ever been the All-Witnessing, the All-Seeing, the All-Protecting, and the All-Encompassing over all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. When I read what the Pen had uttered, I approached the Station whereon was established the Most Great Throne. When I attained His presence and presented it, the Ancient King turned toward me, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which set the heart of the world ablaze. He spoke, and His Word is the Truth: We were seated upon the Throne when the servant who was present entered with thy letter and laid it before Our face. We have answered thee and sent unto thee the pearls of divine knowledge from the depths of thy Lord's omniscient wisdom, that thou mayest rejoice and render thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Informed Speaker. Blessed art thou for having spoken the truth and forbidden that which is unseemly, in conformity with the command of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How excellent are they who have cast away their desires and embraced that which God, the Lord of all worlds, hath willed! Say: By the power of My Most Great Name, O peoples of the earth! By God, the Ancient King hath come for the reformation of the world. Beware lest the doubts of your divines debar you from the ocean of your Lord's knowledge, the Mighty, the Powerful. He speaketh naught save that which shall profit you in this world and in the next. To this beareth witness the Lord of creation Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison: There is none other God but Me, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We make mention of him who was named the Lion, who hath arisen to serve the Cause of his Lord and who uttereth His beauteous praise. We have previously revealed unto him, and in these days also, that which gladdeneth the hearts of the sincere ones. We make mention of him who informed you both of what a certain servant of Ours, named the Noble One, desired, as recorded in a clear Tablet. At this moment We turn Our gaze from this station toward him who desired to assist his wronged Lord, the Peerless One, through Whom the edifice of tranquility was well-nigh shaken and the hearts of them that have recognized Him were sorely agitated. O thou who gazest upon My countenance and drinkest the wine of My loving-kindness! That which thou didst mention hath been mentioned before the Wronged One. God willing, may ye ever remain steadfast in serving the Cause of the All-Glorious and act in accordance with that which He loveth and is pleased with. That which ye have done is most acceptable in the sight of the Wronged One. From this matter a great mischief would have appeared, for although the True One, exalted be His glory, hath desired the reformation of the world, this was contrary and opposed to the Command of God from all aspects. And since ye have beseeched from the heaven of bounty that grace be shown unto him, God willing, may they abide beneath the shadow of His grace and act in accordance with that which God hath willed. In truth their intention was to serve the Truth, for they were not aware of the divine prohibition and what had been revealed in the Tablets as befitteth. We, from this station, send Our greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy, My grace, My favor, My forgiveness and My tender loving-kindness, that he may render thanks unto his Lord, the Generous One. The glory be upon him and upon his father and his brother and upon those who have held fast unto My firm cord. All souls should gaze toward the horizon of God's good-pleasure and hold fast unto that which is beloved before His Presence. All matters in the Divine Book have been made contingent upon wisdom, to this beareth witness My Scriptures, My Books, My Psalms, My Tablets, My Self, and My swift-moving Pen. From the utterances of the Revealer of Verses it is clear and evident what is today beloved before the Divine Throne. Even as the Supreme Pen hath, in numerous passages, nay in most of the Tablets, enjoined wisdom upon all the peoples of the world. The matter of teaching, which is the greatest of all things, is itself contingent upon wisdom, such that if wisdom doth not permit it in a certain place, teaching is not permissible. Blessed are they who have attained unto that which God hath willed.\n\nTo Jenab-i-Aqa Qasim, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory. This evanescent servant conveys greetings sanctified beyond all mention, thought, knowledge and understanding, and gives him the glad tidings of the favor of God, exalted be His glory. May he be assisted, God willing, in that which causes the exaltation of God's Cause. In these days, praise be to God, they have accepted the counsels of that Beloved One, and as soon as they understood that deed to be contrary to God's will, they forsook it and held fast to that which God had willed. Blessed is he, again blessed is he! Joy be unto him, again joy be unto him! That which you wrote concerning them has been accepted before the Divine Throne. Although the stability of this land is uncertain, as was revealed in the divine Tablets in previous years, yet with the utmost joy and fragrance they should turn to the direction of God. And this is what has shone forth from the horizon of the mouth of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. His word, exalted be His grandeur: \"O Qasim! Turn to the Qiblih unto which every qiblih ordained by God for His servants turned on the first day when He uttered the first word, which is 'Verily, I am God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing.' Turn with such detachment as will erase from thy heart the trace of all thou hast known before. Then turn with a face that befitteth one who turneth unto the face of God, the Lord of all worlds.\" By the Lord of the heavens and earth, the entire world cannot equal these two verses. Blessed is he who hath read, heard, written and understood. Woe unto the deniers and the heedless.Some time ago, this servant sent detailed letters to that beloved one and my beloved Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and likewise to Jenab-i-Mirza H and S, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and especially to Jenab-i-Mulla Sadiq, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, each bearing the holy, manifest and luminous revealed lights. God willing, they have arrived. And some time before that, a detailed letter was sent to the beloved of the heart, he who was named by the tongue of the Lord of Creation as 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, the Lord of Power. That too contained divine Tablets and verses. God willing, it has arrived by now and will continue to arrive. To all the friends, expressions of greeting, evanescence, nothingness and non-existence of this transient being are entrusted to the grace of that Beloved One. To the spiritual beloved, Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, I offer greetings. It is hoped that God will assist that in these two days a detailed response to his letter will be sent. The letter from that beloved one dated the twenty-ninth of Sha'ban arrived on the seventh of Shawwal, and at that very moment this letter, which is adorned with verses of grandeur, was written and sent. May all partake of its choice wine and attain His grace. Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who act according to what they were commanded by the Wise Ordainer.The ServantShawwal 1298\n\n=== END BH00844 ===\n\n=== START BH00845 ===\n\nIn the name of Him Who is the All-GloriousThis is a Surah of God which hath been sent down in truth from His hallowed, almighty and resplendent dominion. O 'Ali-i-Nabil! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord at a time when He desireth to depart from your midst by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Because of this, grief hath enveloped all created things, such that the Pen hath been stilled from making mention of mysteries, the Tablet from revelation, the clouds of grace from raining down, and the trees of paradise from bearing fruit, were ye of them that understand. Say: O people! By the True God, ye have been so overcome with bewilderment that ye drive God from His house, even while ye make mention of His names morning and evening. Say: Blind are the eyes that open each morn yet fail to behold My glorious and resplendent Beauty; deaf are the ears that hear voices yet fail to hear My sweet and wondrous melodies; and dumb are the tongues that move yet speak not My Name, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. As for thee, ponder in thine own self upon My tribulations and that which hath befallen Me. By God! No one before Me hath endured that which I have endured, nor could the heavens and earth bear it. From every direction have trials intensified against Me to such extent that I have become content with that wherewith no one else in all the worlds would be content for himself.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Have ye forbidden what God hath made lawful unto you, or have ye made lawful what He hath forbidden, or have ye altered His decree from what was revealed in the Tablets of God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Gracious? And if My crime be the verses of God that descend upon Me, \\[by God\\] this is not from Me but from One Mighty and Beautiful. By God, I am not the first to commit this sin, for most of the Prophets committed it before Me, including 'Ali before Nabil, and before him Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before him the Christ, and before him the Interlocutor - all spoke what the Spirit inspired them from the Kingdom of God, the Supreme, the Powerful.Say: By God, none like unto Me hath appeared in creation, and I am He Whose like no eye hath beheld, and I am the Omnipotent over what I wish, and I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. Whoso denieth My Cause hath denied all the Messengers, and whoso turneth away from My face hath turned away from the face of God. To this testify the realities of all created things, then the tongues of all beings, then this Tongue, All-Knowing, All-Wise.Say: O people of the Bayan! We were among you as one of you, yet ye were not content with this. Therefore We drew aside seventy thousand veils from the face of the Cause, yet still ye were not content. We drew aside yet more veils until the Cause reached this most exalted, sublime station. And if ye are still not content with this, We shall draw aside the veils through Our power and Our sovereignty, despite your will, O company of the heedless. Thus hath ever been the way of the Messengers and the nature of the sincere ones, if ye be of them that know.When ye turned away from His first Beauty in His later Temple, denied His verses and rejected His bounty, then did He depart from your midst alone, at a time when He was detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth. To this My deeds bear witness, if ye be of the fair-minded.Say: We have set Our face toward Him Who created the heavens and the throne, and I seek no helper save God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people, know ye that My helper is My heart, My fortress is My trust in God, My companion is My Beauty, My army is My remembrance, and My party are the denizens of the highest Paradise.Say: By God, when We found people worshipping suppositions and vain imaginings instead of God, We occupied them with these as a recompense for their deeds, that perchance other creatures might be awakened thereby. Therefore judge thou for thyself: Is it befitting that those who turn to nothingness should make mention of the Beauty of the Ancient of Days? Nay, by My Self, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate! Therefore hath God sanctified the hem of His robe from the defilement of their mention, these evil ones, and purified it from names and attributes, both hidden and manifest. Yet the people have not heeded this and remain among the heedless.And thou, O 'Ali, close thine eyes to such as these, then turn thy gaze away from all who are in the heavens and the earth, then remind the people of what the Spirit inspireth thee at every moment. By God, if thou wilt detach thyself from the world and from those from whom thou perceivest the stench of unbelief, thou shalt find thyself in a station that the hearts of them who are nigh cannot comprehend, and thou shalt find thyself more learned than any possessor of knowledge, perfect and wise. Therefore rend asunder the veils in My Name, the Chosen One, and pay no heed to the wicked ones, then drink from the pure wine of the righteous ones from this radiant chalice.\n\nO Ali, leave the kingdom to its seeker, then free thyself from the prison of hopes. Be content with My love, for verily it is better than the treasures of the heavens and earth, than all that was and will be. This indeed is My command unto thee and My counsel to the sanctified ones.Through the power of the All-Merciful, shun the serpent that harbors in its heart rancor against the Gracious One. Turn away from such a one, even if he recites to thee all that hath been revealed in the holy scrolls, or holds fast to tablets of manifest glory.By God, O Ali, We heard with Our own hearing, from behind the wall, those who dwelt in the House and sought refuge in the station round which circle the people of Paradise, then the denizens of the holy veils, then the angels who glorify Him. By God, none among all created things hath heard what We heard. Yet We concealed the matter in such wise that they imagined God to be heedless of them. Say: Evil is that which ye have imagined. Verily He knoweth the secrets of the heavens and earth, and He hath knowledge of all things.Thus was I tormented among these people, while behind them lurked the thickets of malice, and the darkness of hatred encompassed Me on My right, and God is witness to what I say. Until matters reached these days wherein He desires to conceal the Beauty of Holiness behind the brocade of detachment, and to withdraw from all males and females, from every young and old, save those whom God hath made My charges in this worldly life. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all things are preserved with Him in a guarding tablet.Know thou that the cause of departure was not what We have mentioned to thee in this luminous Tablet. Rather, We found Ourself a leader on earth and a shepherd to these people. Therefore We left it to whomsoever desired it. And formerly, when there was no one among the people and there were hardships, fear and killing, We manifested Ourself between heaven and earth and shone forth from the horizon with manifest sovereignty. Then, when We found the earth at rest, We withdrew Ourself and entrusted it to another people.By My life! The governed is better than a thousand governors, the led is more exalted than a thousand leaders, and the oppressed is better than the city of oppressors. Follow thou thy Beloved in this, then detach thyself from all things. Then emerge from behind the veils of silence, then speak the truth with My wondrous and sublime melody, then soar in the kingdom of detachment on holy, transcendent, swift, gentle and lofty wings.\n\n=== END BH00845 ===\n\n=== START BH00846 ===\n\nLet thine ear be attentive, O Nabil-i-A'?am, to the Voice of the Ancient of Days, crying to thee from the Kingdom of His all-glorious Name. He it is Who is now proclaiming from the realms above, and within the inmost essence of all created things: \"I truly am God, there is none other God but Me. I am He Who, from everlasting, hath been the Source of all sovereignty and power, He Who shall continue, throughout eternity, to exercise His kingship and to extend His protection unto all created things. My proof is the greatness of My might and My sovereignty that embraceth the whole of creation.\"Blessed art thou, O My name, inasmuch as thou hast entered Mine Ark, and art speeding, through the power of My sovereign and most exalted might, on the ocean of grandeur, and art numbered with My favored ones whose names the Finger of God hath inscribed. Thou hast quaffed the cup which is life indeed from the hands of this Youth, around Whom revolve the Manifestations of the All-Glorious, and the brightness of Whose presence they Who are the Day Springs of Mercy extol in the day time and in the night season.His glory be with thee, inasmuch as thou hast journeyed from God unto God, and entered within the borders of the Court of unfading splendor - the Spot which mortal man can never describe. Therein hath the breeze of holiness, laden with the love of thy Lord, stirred thy spirit within thee, and the waters of understanding have washed from thee the stains of remoteness and ungodliness. Thou hast gained admittance into the Paradise of God's Remembrance, through thy recognition of Him Who is the Embodiment of that Remembrance amongst men.Wherefore, be thankful to God, for having strengthened thee to aid His Cause, for having made the flowers of knowledge and understanding to spring forth in the garden of thine heart. Thus hath His grace encompassed thee, and encompassed the whole of creation. Beware, lest thou allow anything whatsoever to grieve thee. Rid thyself of all attachment to the vain allusions of men, and cast behind thy back the idle and subtle disputations of them that are veiled from God. Proclaim, then, that which the Most Great Spirit will inspire thee to utter in the service of the Cause of thy Lord, that thou mayest stir up the souls of all men and incline their hearts unto this most blessed and all-glorious Court.Know thou that We have annulled the rule of the sword, as an aid to Our Cause, and substituted for it the power born of the utterance of men. Thus have We irrevocably decreed, by virtue of Our grace. Say: O people! Sow not the seeds of discord among men and refrain from contending with your neighbor, for your Lord hath committed the world and the cities thereof to the care of the kings of the earth, and made them the emblems of His own power, by virtue of the sovereignty He hath chosen to bestow upon them. He hath refused to reserve for Himself any share whatever of this world's dominion. To this He Who is Himself the Eternal Truth will testify. The things He hath reserved for Himself are the cities of men's hearts, that He may cleanse them from all earthly defilements, and enable them to draw nigh unto the hallowed Spot which the hands of the infidel can never profane. Open, O people, the city of the human heart with the key of your utterance. Thus have We, according to a pre-ordained measure, prescribed unto you your duty.By the righteousness of God! The world and its vanities, and its glory, and whatever delights it can offer, are all, in the sight of God, as worthless as, nay, even more contemptible than, dust and ashes. Would that the hearts of men could comprehend it!Cleanse yourselves thoroughly, O people of Baha, from the defilement of the world, and of all that pertaineth unto it. God Himself beareth Me witness. The things of the earth ill beseem you. Cast them away unto such as may desire them, and fasten your eyes upon this most holy and effulgent Vision. That which beseemeth you is the love of God, and the love of Him Who is the Manifestation of His Essence, and the observance of whatsoever He chooseth to prescribe unto you, did ye but know it.Say: Let truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning. Suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance and justice, that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted from your hearts upon all created things. Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments.Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions of most men, be they high or low, differ from their conduct. It is through your deeds that ye can distinguish yourselves from others. Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon the whole earth.Happy is the man that heedeth My counsel, and keepeth the precepts prescribed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00846 ===\n\n=== START BH00847 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One True Loving God!Praise, sanctified beyond mention and utterance, befitteth the Most Beloved Lord Who hath adorned creation with the ornament of knowledge and, after the dawning of the luminous morn, caused the sun of insight to appear from the horizon of the world. He is the Omnipotent One Who, from a single point, hath detailed all that was and shall be, bringing it forth to the realm of manifestation. The signs of His power are visible and evident in all things, and the tokens of His grandeur are manifest and apparent throughout all creation. Through His consummate might He hath caused the Promised Day, which was inscribed and recorded in the Books and Scriptures, to be made manifest through the blessedness of His Most Great Name, and with but a single word hath breathed new life into the ancient world. How excellent is the state of the soul who, in this blessed Day, hath drunk from the fountain of awareness and reposed beneath the celestial Tree! This is the Day which, among all ages, centuries and epochs, hath been specifically designated by and attributed to Truth - exalted be His glory. How many souls who counted themselves among the foremost, yet whose names are not mentioned in the Holy Court; and how many who were unknown, yet today are remembered with utmost elevation and nobility in the Court of the True One! Glorified, glorified is He Who maketh ocean waves to appear from a drop, and the effulgences of the Sun from an atom! The ocean of knowledge hath appeared, yet the servants remain heedless of it; the sun of wisdom hath risen, yet people remain deprived and portionless thereof, save whom God willeth. Upon every leaf of the leaves of the world, the Supreme Pen hath inscribed and recorded the mysteries of evanescence, and on every page of the pages of existence, the symbols of impermanence are evident and written. Nevertheless, they have set their hearts upon it, occupied themselves with it, and rejoice in it. They have lost indeed who have turned away from the Countenance and followed the dictates of their desires. These have not found the sweetness of the verses, nor recognized the fragrance of the days of God, nor attained to that which was the purpose of the creation of the world. I testify that they have strayed from the straight path. My spirit be a sacrifice for your service, and a sacrifice for your steadfastness, O thou who art immersed in the ocean of the love of God, and O thou who art engaged in the service of the Cause of God, and O thou who art steadfast in His remembrance and praise amidst the concourse of creation! Thou art the one who hath sacrificed thy self, thy wealth, and all that is attributed unto thee in the path of God. All things bear witness to your sincerity, your turning to God, your steadfastness, your praise, your remembrance, your testimony, and your service unto God, the Lord of the visible and invisible, and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. It behooveth every lover to praise God for this and to thank Him for having confirmed you in that whereunto ye have attained, and for having adorned you with the ornament of His Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nAnd moreover, the Star rising from the horizon of the heaven of the love of God arrived in the form of a letter, illumining the heart and soul, nay all limbs, with the light of joy and gladness. That which you had expressed, and your questioning of the reports concerning events in the Land of the Prison - nay, by Him Who illumined the horizon of the world with the Most Great Light! All atoms bear witness that your honor has ever been occupied with service to the Cause, and in expressing what has transpired had and has no purpose save the good-pleasure of God. The Truth, exalted be His glory, His bounty and His grandeur, hath spoken with His blessed tongue, saying that \"My Name Ha (upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious), due to his being set ablaze with the fire of divine love, informed the servants of God of events that had occurred in the Most Great Prison. Verily he hath acted in accordance with what befitteth his sincerity, his love and his turning unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.\" These words having ended, this servant and all things testify that whatsoever existeth in the heavens and earth cannot equal these few words sent down from the heaven of divine favor. That petition of this servant which was dispatched to your presence, and that which was revealed therein from His Most Exalted Pen, testifieth that your honor hath spoken for God's sake, informed for God's sake, and arose for God's sake. For a long time, extreme hardship and difficulty were daily manifest in this land, until new events also \\[...\\] However, so that grief and sorrow might not seize the heart of your honor and those who drink the choice wine of divine knowledge, these matters were concealed. Indeed, what they had reported was greater than this, but was not revealed. Verily He is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.Another matter: your honor's letter and that of Sheikh S (upon him be the Glory of God) were in the Prison Land while this servant submits this reply from the farm. Therefore, if it does not accord exactly with reality, forgiveness is hoped for, as it is necessary to have the original letter at hand when submitting a reply. However, at present this servant is here while your esteemed letter and that of the Sheikh are in Akka. Thus was the matter decreed. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Decreer, the All-Knowing.Concerning what was written about the threshold for Huququ'llah, it is as was written to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin (upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious). The basic threshold upon which Huquq becomes applicable is nineteen, and this accords with the Most Holy Book, for in that verse the intention was to explain the amount, not the threshold. Verily He is the Expositor in the beginning and the end. Until this year, mention of Huququ'llah had not been made - that is, this servant had not heard a word from the Most Holy Tongue indicating the collection of Huquq. However, in this year the firm decree was issued and appeared manifest from the horizon of the Cause. They stated that should anyone wish to pay Huququ'llah willingly and gladly, it would be accepted and the trustees should receive it and, as commanded, inform the Most Holy Court. Although the Most Holy Book was revealed from the heaven of the Cause several years ago and the law of Huquq was established therein, nevertheless until this year They did not command its collection. Verily He is the Ruler, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nAnother submission is that I convey expressions of sincere devotion to his honor Shaykh S, upon him be the Glory of God. He is among those who have been touched by harm and hardship in the path of God, the Lord of Names. These blessed words I once heard from the tongue of the Beloved of the worlds concerning him: \"Blessed be he, then joy be unto him.\" I beseech the Most High to assist him in His remembrance and praise in all conditions. Verily, He is the Answerer, the Generous. The Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who are related to you, from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.In Dhi'l-Hajjih\n\n=== END BH00847 ===\n\n=== START BH00848 ===\n\nPraised be Thou, O Lord my God! I supplicate Thee by Him Whom Thou hast called into being, Whose Revelation Thou hast ordained to be Thine own Revelation and His Concealment Thine own Concealment. Through His Firstness Thou hast confirmed Thine own Firstness, and through His Lastness Thou hast affirmed Thine own Lastness. Through the power of His might and the influence of His sovereignty the mighty have apprehended Thine omnipotence, and through His glory they who are endowed with authority have acknowledged Thy majesty and greatness. Through His supreme ascendancy Thy transcendent sovereignty and all-encompassing dominion have been recognized, and through His will Thine own will hath been revealed. Through the light of His countenance the splendors of Thine own face have shone forth, and through His Cause Thine own Cause hath been made manifest. Through the generative power of His utterance the whole earth hath been made the recipient of the wondrous signs and tokens of Thy sovereignty, and the heavens have been filled with the revelations of Thine incomparable majesty, and the seas have been enriched with the sacred pearls of Thine omniscience and wisdom, and the trees adorned with the fruits of Thy knowledge. Through Him all things have sung Thy praise, and all the eyes have been turned in the direction of Thy mercy. Through Him the faces of all have been set towards the splendors of the light of Thy countenance, and the souls of all have been inclined unto the revelations of Thy divine greatness.\n\nHow great is Thy power! How exalted Thy sovereignty! How lofty Thy might! How excellent Thy majesty! How supreme is Thy grandeur -- a grandeur which He Who is Thy Manifestation hath made known and wherewith Thou hast invested Him as a sign of Thy generosity and bountiful favor. I bear witness, O my God, that through Him Thy most resplendent signs have been uncovered, and Thy mercy hath encompassed the entire creation. But for Him, how could the Celestial Dove have uttered its songs or the Heavenly Nightingale, according to the decree of God, have warbled its melody?\n\nI testify that no sooner had the First Word proceeded, through the potency of Thy will and purpose, out of His mouth, and the First Call gone forth from His lips than the whole creation was revolutionized, and all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth were stirred to the depths. Through that Word the realities of all created things were shaken, were divided, separated, scattered, combined and reunited, disclosing, in both the contingent world and the heavenly kingdom, entities of a new creation, and revealing, in the unseen realms, the signs and tokens of Thy unity and oneness. Through that Call Thou didst announce unto all Thy servants the advent of Thy most great Revelation and the appearance of Thy most perfect Cause.\n\nNo sooner had that Revelation been unveiled to men's eyes than the signs of universal discord appeared among the peoples of the world, and commotion seized the dwellers of earth and heaven, and the foundations of all things were shaken. The forces of dissension were released, the meaning of the Word was unfolded, and every several atom in all created things acquired its own distinct and separate character. Hell was made to blaze, and the delights of Paradise were uncovered to men's eyes. Blessed is the man that turneth towards Thee, and woe betide him who standeth aloof from Thee, who denieth Thee and repudiateth Thy signs in this Revelation wherein the faces of the exponents of denial have turned black and the faces of the exponents of truthfulness have turned white, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names and attributes, Who holdest in Thy grasp the empire of whatever hath been created in heaven and on earth!\n\nPraise be to Thee, therefore, O my God -- such praise as Thou didst ascribe to Thine own Self, and which none except Thee can either comprehend or reckon. Thou art He, O my Lord, Who hath made known His own Self unto me, at a time when Thy servants have failed to recognize Thee -- servants who, by virtue of the ties that bind them to Thee, have been ruling over all that dwell on earth and have been vaunting themselves over its peoples. Were I, O my God, to exercise from pole to pole supreme dominion over the earth, and were I to be offered all the treasures it containeth, and were I to expend them in Thy path, I would still be powerless to attain unto this station, unless I were assisted and strengthened by Thee. And were I to glorify Thee, O my God, so long as the glory of Thy majesty endureth and the influence of Thy sovereignty and power will last, such a glorification could never be compared with any of the praises which Thou, as a token of Thy grace, hast taught me, and wherewith Thou hast bidden me to extol Thy virtues. If such be the excellence of each one of the praises which Thou hast taught me, how immeasurably greater must be the excellence of the station of the One Who hath known Thee, Who hath entered Thy Presence, and pursued steadfastly the path of Thy Cause!\n\nI have clearly perceived, and I am wholly persuaded, that Thou hast from everlasting been immeasurably exalted above the mention of all beings, and wilt continue unto everlasting to remain far above the conception of Thy creatures. None can befittingly praise Thee except Thine own Self and such as are like unto Thee. Thou hast, verily, been at all times, and wilt everlastingly continue to remain, immensely exalted beyond and above all comparison and likeness, above all imagination of parity or resemblance. Having, thus, recognized Thee as One Who is incomparable, and Whose nature none can possess, it becometh incontrovertibly evident that whosoever may praise Thee, his praise can befit only such as are of his own nature, and are subject to his own limitations, and it can in no wise adequately describe the sublimity of Thy sovereignty, nor scale the heights of Thy majesty and holiness. How sweet, therefore, is the praise Thou givest to Thine own Self, and the description Thou givest of Thine own Being!\n\nI testify, O my God, that Thou hast, from eternity, sent down upon Thy servants naught else except that which can cause them to soar up and be drawn near unto Thee, and to ascend into the heaven of Thy transcendent oneness. Thou hast established Thy bounds among them, and ordained them to stand among Thy creatures as evidences of Thy justice and as signs of Thy mercy, and to be the stronghold of Thy protection amongst Thy people, that no man may in Thy realm transgress against his neighbor. How great is the blessedness of him who, for love of Thy beauty and for the sake of Thy pleasure, hath curbed the desires of a corrupt inclination and observed the precepts laid down by Thy most exalted Pen! He, in truth, is to be numbered with them that have attained unto all good, and followed the way of guidance.\n\nI beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Name through which Thou hast enabled Thy servants and Thy people to know Thee, through which Thou hast drawn the hearts of those who have recognized Thee towards the resplendent court of Thy oneness, and the souls of Thy favored ones unto the Day-Spring of Thy unity, -- I beseech Thee to grant that I may be assisted to observe the fast wholly for Thy sake, O Thou Who art full of majesty and glory! Empower me, then, O my God, to be reckoned among them that have clung to Thy laws and precepts for the sake of Thee alone, their eyes fixed on Thy face. These, indeed, are they whose wine is all that hath proceeded out of the mouth of Thy primal will, whose pure beverage is Thine enthralling call, whose heavenly River is Thy love, whose Paradise is entrance into Thy presence and reunion with Thee. For Thou hast been their Beginning and their End, and their Highest Hope, and their Supreme Desire. Blinded be the eye that gazeth on whatsoever may displease Thee, and confounded be the soul that seeketh the things that are contrary to Thy will.\n\nDeign, O my God, I implore Thee, by Thy Self and by them, to accept, through Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness, the works we have performed, however much they fall short of the loftiness of Thy state and the sublimity of Thy station, O Thou Who art most dear to the hearts that long for Thee, and the Healer of the souls that have recognized Thee! Rain down, therefore, upon us from the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy gracious providence that which will cleanse us from the faintest trace of evil and corrupt desires, and will draw us nearer unto Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy most exalted and all-glorious Self. Thou art, verily, the Lord of this world and of the next, and art powerful to do all things.\n\nDo Thou bless, O Lord my God, the Primal Point, through Whom the point of creation hath been made to revolve in both the visible and invisible worlds, Whom Thou hast designated as the One whereunto should return whatsoever must return unto Thee, and as the Revealer of whatsoever may be manifested by Thee. Do Thou also bless such of His Letters as have not turned away from Thee, who have been firmly established in Thy love, and clung steadfastly to Thy good-pleasure. Bless Thou, likewise, as long as Thine own Self endureth and Thine own Essence doth last, them that have suffered martyrdom in Thy path. Thou art, verily, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nMoreover, I beseech Thee, O my God, by Him Whom Thou hast announced unto us in all Thy Tablets and Thy Books and Thy Scrolls and Thy Scriptures, through Whom the kingdom of names hath been convulsed, and all that lay hid in the breasts of them that have followed their evil and corrupt desires hath been revealed, -- I beseech Thee to strengthen us in our love for Him, to make us steadfast in His Cause, to help us befriend His loved ones and challenge His enemies. Shield us, then, O my God, from the mischief wrought by them that have denied Thy presence, and turned away from Thy face, and resolved to put an end to the life of Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine own Self.\n\nO my God and my Master! Thou knowest how they have disgraced Thy Cause and dishonored Thee among Thy creatures, how they have joined Thine enemies, that they may undermine Thy Revelation and injure Thee. Lay hold on them with the power of Thy wrath and might, O my God, and expose their shameful acts and their wickedness, that whatever is hid in their breasts may be revealed unto the people that dwell within Thy land, O Thou Who art the Inflictor of trials, the Fashioner of nations, and the Bestower of favors! No God is there beside Thee, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.\n\nPraised be Thou, O Lord my God! I supplicate Thee by Him Whom Thou hast called into being, Whose Revelation Thou hast ordained to be Thine own Revelation and His Concealment Thine own Concealment.

Hold thou fast unto the cord of God; verily it will lead thee to the most exalted summit, from God, the Lord of Lords.O Abul-Qasim! Spread wide thy robe to receive the pearls of the ocean of thy Lord's utterance, the Lord of all mankind. Beware lest the affairs of men debar thee from the Truth or the allusions of them who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the End cause thee grief. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him. Thus doth the Mother Book command thee.O Abdul-Hamid! He Who hath come with the Truth and hath guided all to the straight path maketh mention of thee. Say: O concourse of divines! Die in your wrath! He hath come through Whose name your idols of self have been shattered and your fancies and imaginings obliterated. We counsel thee and My loved ones with that which We have counseled all in the Holy Books and Tablets.O Ali-Akbar! Be thou patient in adversity and steadfast in service to the Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of men nor the veils of them who have turned away from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, shall cause thee to slip. We have counseled all with goodly deeds and with that which shall exalt their stations. The Tongue of Grandeur in the most exalted station beareth witness unto this.

We make mention of thee as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds, Who speaketh at all times from the most exalted horizon: \"The Kingdom is God's, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Blessed is he who hath turned toward My horizon, heard My call, and arisen to serve My Cause, the Firm, the Impregnable.O Abbas! He Who hath never been overtaken by slumber in the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, maketh mention of thee. He hath arisen to promote the Cause in such wise that neither the weapons of the world could shake Him nor the doubts of the wayward could cause Him to stumble. He stood amongst the peoples and proclaimed in the most exalted call: \"Come, O people of the earth, unto the Dayspring of the signs of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful!\"O Muhammad-Sadiq! We have called all unto that which would draw them to the supreme horizon. Among the people are those who have turned toward it, those who have turned away, and those whom We behold in manifest doubt. How many a servant hath heard and denied, turned toward and then away. Thus have the various stages been made manifest. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.O Mahmud! The All-Loving maketh mention of thee from His glorious station and calleth thee to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

The Desired One hath come, yet most of the people understand not. They hear the call from the precincts of the Prison, yet they perceive not. When asked by what proof they have believed in God, they say \"By the Qur'an,\" yet when We reveal unto them that which is greater than it, they disbelieve in the Witness and the Witnessed.

To this testifieth every discerning scholar.O Dhabih! Verily the Sacrifice offered up his soul in the path of God. By My life! He advanced to the station of sacrifice with a light that illumined the faces of them that are nigh unto God. Blessed is he who maketh mention of him, visiteth him, and circumambulateth his tomb. He is among the most exalted of creatures in a glorious Tablet. Give thanks unto God for that the Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.We make mention of him who was named 'Abdu'l-Vasi' that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. O My loved ones! It behooveth you to make good what hath passed you by in My days. Thus doth command you He Who heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Beware lest the doubts of the divines hold thee back from Him Who is known, or the utterances of the polytheists sadden thee - they who speak according to their vain imaginings without clear proof from God, the Mighty, the Great.O Naw-ruz-'Ali! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the Prison and hath moved His Most Exalted Pen to make mention of thee, that thou mayest soar on the wings of longing in this subtle and gentle air, from whose wafting breezes can be heard: \"The Promise is fulfilled and the Promised One hath called all to the straight path of God.\"We have desired to make mention of him who was named Isma'il, that the remembrance may attract him to a station wherein he shall see naught save the manifestations of My Most Beautiful Names and the dawning-places of My most exalted attributes.

Thus hath the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen been raised, yet most of the people are asleep.O Muhammad-Baqir! Give thanks for that God hath aided thee to recognize Him Who was recorded in the books of the Messengers. They have lost indeed who turned away from the Face when Its lights shone forth from the horizon of eternity after the passing of all things. Verily thy Lord is the Elucidator, the All-Knowing. When He was established upon the throne, He addressed His loved ones with a word that nothing in the invisible or visible world can equal, if thou be of them that know.The Prisoner hath at this moment turned toward him who was named Asadu'llah, that the greatest joy might take hold of him and draw him to a station that was illumined by the lights of the Face. Rejoice thou that the Tongue of the All-Merciful maketh mention of thee in the Kingdom of Utterance with verses that were in truth sent down from the heaven of glory. Beware lest the affairs of the world hold thee back from the Lord of all being. Turn away from them, then turn with thy heart to an ocean that was renowned by the name of God.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! The Wronged One calleth thee from His Most Great Prison in 'Akka, which hath been designated as the White Dome in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds.

I testify that there is none other God but Him, and He Whom He hath sent with truth and justice is verily the Dayspring of His names, the Dawning-place of His attributes, the Manifestation of His Self, and the One Who hath arisen to serve His Cause, through Whom His fragrance hath been wafted abroad and His laws have been spread throughout all lands. And upon His family and His companions, through whom the limbs of the oppressors were made to quake and the hearts of the sincere were made tranquil. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, by Him and by them, to aid His servants to exalt His Word, to manifest His oneness, and to spread His signs. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.And then, O beloved of my heart, thy noble letters arrived like a true friend. In truth, the letters of the friends are friendship itself, which no worldly events can alter, and they are likewise mirrors reflecting love and affection in such wise that neither the veils of the prejudiced nor the clouds of the misguided can obscure or prevent them. Glory be to God! This too is one of the fruits of divine wisdom. Who is capable of mentioning it as it deserveth mention, or of knowing it as it deserveth to be known? After perusing and studying each one, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Station and presented them before the countenance of my Lord. He said: \"O Javad! Upon thee be My peace, My remembrance, and My praise. Thou dost bear witness and art well aware that this Wronged One hath, from the earliest days, summoned the servants unto trustworthiness, which is the greatest means for the wealth and tranquility of nations, and likewise unto religion, which is a mighty stronghold for the protection of the peoples of the world. Yet in the end, the unjust ones in the world arose in tyranny. They abandoned gratitude and began to complain. In place of love appeared enmity, and in place of faithfulness, hatred.\" Say:\"My God, my God! Thou seest Thy chosen ones in the hands of Thy heedless servants. O my Lord! Aid them with the hosts of justice, then send down upon them from the clouds of grace Thy mercy and from Thyself Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things, by Thy Most Exalted Pen and by Thy Most Great Signs, and by the Dawning-Place of Thy unity and the Manifestation of Thy singleness, through Whom the vale of Mecca flowed and the throne of Thy justice was established in the kingdom of creation, to assist me and Thy loved ones to observe religion and trustworthiness and whatsoever Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThe servant came with your letter and read it before His face. We found from it the fragrance of your sincerity and certitude in the Cause of God, the Goal of all who are in the heavens and earth. We testify that you attained in the early days, aided the Wronged One, and acted as commanded by the exiled and lonely One. We beseech God to assist you and aid you in that which will make known to the people His straight path, guide them to His mighty announcement, and draw them near to the court of His chosen ones who did not break His covenant and His bond, and who said, despite the enemies: \"The kingdom belongs to God, our Lord, the Lord of our fathers, and the Lord of the glorious throne.\" Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and illumine them with My beauteous remembrance.With firm and certain proof that that beloved of the heart has not been forgotten and has ever been and continues to be remembered. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He will adorn that beloved one with His special bounties and aid him to serve His Cause at all times. Verily He is the Omnipotent, as witnessed by His own Self to His own Self, and He is the Generous by the testimony of the kingdom of His wondrous utterance, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. I send greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land. Their station is truly in the heart and their place is in prison, for they are of this element and of this earth. This is the holy valley mentioned in the Furqan, which, despite the divines of Iran, has been and continues to be the object of the gaze of those near and sincere. We hope that God will transform these dispersions into unity so that we may all sit together and engage in the remembrance of the Peerless Friend.As for Haji 'Amu, upon him be God's peace, God willing, the blessed Tablet will be sent. That beloved one and his relatives - all their connection is to God, exalted be His glory. God willing, may they know the worth of this greatest bounty and hold fast to what is befitting.As for the letter of the Master, upon him be God's peace, in the early days during the incident that occurred in 'Ayn and Shin, all were honored with mention and the luminary of favor, and specifically for each one a separate Tablet was sent, half of which expressed favor to the recipient of the Tablet and the other half was a visitation for His Holiness the exalted Martyr. Repeatedly all were forbidden from discord and commanded to unity. Some time passed and afterward no mention of the Master was heard concerning them. The ocean of grace paused. The Master and some of the loved ones repeatedly sent letters mentioning the events of that land. Nevertheless, the decree of silence appeared until in these days news arrived from them and Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-Karim and others, and it is hoped that in these days answers will be graciously given to all. I beseech God to assist the Master in uniting hearts - this is a righteous and acceptable deed. The Command is in the hand of God, the Kind, the Forgiving.And regarding the fact that Aqa 'Ali, upon him be God's peace, has intended to send children to school - this matter was presented and the greatest prohibition appeared. The wisdom of non-acceptance is clear and evident, needing no mention now or ever.In mentioning the true Beloved in the direction of the two names, His Holiness Mim and ?a, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, this verse is appropriate which was said before:A moon departed from this city and went toward another city \\[...\\]\n\nOne day They decided to visit the garden, and after Their arrival Their place became clear and evident. How many days They arose to serve, purely for the sake of God! Praise be to God, the straight path for all to follow became manifest through Them. It is hoped that through Their endeavors the path of all in the world may become clear and known, so that all may find the straight path and forever engage in praising and thanking the Causer of causes. Light, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God's loved ones there who are not distracted from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, by commerce or by what people possess.\n\n=== END BH00850 ===\n\n=== START BH00851 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-PowerfulPraise be to God Who hath guided us to His straight path, Who hath caused us to speak of His oneness and His attributes, and Who hath enabled us to acknowledge that which His Most Exalted Pen hath uttered - that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books as a token of His grace, and commanded them to guide His servants that they might manifest that which would exalt them in all His worlds, until the divine ordinances were completed through that which was revealed in the Qur'an to the Seal of the Prophets and the Chosen Ones. Verily, it is the manifest Book of God, His mighty Command, and His radiant and resplendent Light whereby the world was illumined and nations were exalted. May the prayers that shine forth from the heaven of His grace be upon Him and upon His family and companions, who were as an ocean in their bounty, as a sword in battle, as the sky in their generosity, and as an army in their support. They manifested in every station that which was befitting and proper for them. Through them was made manifest what was made manifest, and was established what was revealed in God's Book, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings and Lord of the Sacred House! I beseech Thee by the Sacred Place and Station, by the mysteries Thou didst confide to the heart of Thy Beloved when He ascended unto Thee on the Night of Ascension, by the manifestation of Thy power on the Day of Resurrection, and by Thy settlement upon the throne of Thy greatness, O Lord of all beings and Breaker of idols, to send down upon Thy loved ones from the heaven of Thy bounty glory, honor, mercy and blessing. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.Thereafter, praise be to God, as the Shaykh said, I was seated, my thoughts turned inward - that is, contemplating my own heedlessness, failings and shortcomings - when suddenly the door of joy was opened and the countenance of the letter appeared, bringing what the spring caravan brings. No joy or delight, no pleasure or comfort can compare with it. God knows, God knows what it bestowed upon the heart, from which sprouted the sweet basil and roses of love. It is the cause and the means thereof. With but one drop it can transform barren land into good soil and grant a hundred thousand utterances to the dumb. Its mark is visible upon all things, and its trace is evident in all things. It bestows the spirit of inner meanings upon the temple of utterance. Were but a breeze from its direction to pass over the people of the world, all would turn to the most exalted horizon and detach themselves from aught else.After reading and becoming acquainted with it, we proceeded to the station and it was presented. The Lord spoke that which was spirit to bodies, light to the righteous, and meaning to words, concluding with these most exalted words: \"We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist them in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to adorn the pages of the world with their names, their mention, and that which proceedeth from them.\"God is witness and testifier that these beloved ones have ever been and are before His face in the nights and days, their mention being with the Lord. As for the mention of turning toward Egypt, and likewise the subsequent turning of the beloved of hearts, his honor M.H., upon him be the glory of God - God willing, Egypt shall be blessed and shall receive a full portion from this turning, for it hath been honored by two most exalted names. By the life of our Purpose and your Purpose, the breath of the chosen ones is effective, their existence is effective, their turning is effective, their utterance is effective.\n\nThe mention of Haji Muhammad-Baqir and others, upon them be God's peace, which they wrote about, brought the utmost joy and fresh delight. This word was the effect of the verses of the garden of inner meanings. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to increase the reward of that beloved one. In truth, this matter was a cause of sorrow to the Blessed Beauty. That beloved of the heart bears witness and knows that one must grasp and hold fast to all means that promote the unity of God's loved ones, for unity itself is among the hosts of God, exalted be His glory. Indeed, had the idolaters truly witnessed the unity of the people of divine unity, they would never have dared to oppose them. The world's ruin stems from discord, and its prosperity from unity. In one place it is stated that unity is the lamp of the heart and its guardian. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to grant the sweetness of unity that all may taste thereof and share it. This evanescent one offers his utter nothingness in service to each of the believers in divine unity and seeks help from all, that he may perchance succeed in justice and fairness and in deeds that are the cause and means of God's good-pleasure and salvation.As to what was written regarding the treasury, I beseech God, exalted be His station, that from that eternal treasury may appear sweet and goodly gifts--that is, those that are praiseworthy and desirable--of trustworthiness, religious devotion, wealth, blessing, bounty, kindness, mercy and glory. However, one must first ask God to grant all the capacity to become worthy and capable of receiving true gifts. God willing, from that treasury may the treasuries of the world be made prosperous--that is, hearts--and from that shop may both worlds receive their portion. The command is in God's hand, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in earth and heaven. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful.As to what was written regarding 'Ali, upon him be God's peace, and his attention to the palm trees, though outwardly they have not been seen or planted, yet inwardly they are lofty palm trees. I fear the mullas, otherwise I would say that their roots are firm and their branches reach unto heaven. These are the trials of this poor one which appear and are evident from every corner. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for grace and seek His bounty that He may ever keep pure the intention of this evanescent servant and make it for His sake. He is the Bestower, the Kind. I also beseech Him to assist 'Ali with all divine outpourings and to place this deed of his in the third category, according to His word, exalted be He: \"And among them are those who outstrip others in good works.\" Grace belongs to God, the Revealer of verses, the Manifester of clear proofs, the Remover of doubts, and He is the Protector over all names and attributes.\n\nAs mention hath been made of His honor Haji Mirza, upon him be the peace of God and His grace, and likewise mention of His honor Haji A.A., upon them both be Baha'u'llah's \\[glory\\], if that beloved one is present in that land, convey greetings on behalf of this deprived one to each of them. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant unto each one both outward and inward bounties, and sustenance both earthly and heavenly, and this will assuredly be answered through His generosity, which hath encouraged me, and through His bounty, which hath increased my certitude. And I implore God to bestow speedy recovery upon the honored beloved, His honor A.B., upon him be Baha'u'llah's \\[glory\\]. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\n=== END BH00851 ===\n\n=== START BH00852 ===\n\nHe is the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting!

Have ye seen a day mightier than this Day wherein the dawn of Revelation hath shone forth, the Speaker of Sinai hath spoken, and the darkness hath been illumined by the gleaming of the Light from this conspicuous Station? The cups of joy have been passed round by the hands of grace and bounty, and the people of Baha, who are embarked upon the Crimson Ark that saileth upon the sea of grandeur by the command of God, the Creator of all things and the Lord of creation, have drunk therefrom.Beware lest the doubts of the people of error withhold you from turning towards the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, or lest that which hath been said before or will be said deprive you of recognizing your Lord on the Day of Return. The Promise hath come, and the Promised One hath appeared on this witnessed Day, and all who dwell in the realms of the seen and unseen have called to His glorious station. Blessed is he who hath recognized his Lord, the All-Loving, who hath detached himself from all that exists within the realm of being, who hath remained steadfast upon His straight path, opposing the desires of every rejected polytheist. He hath attained unto that which his Lord, the Worshipped One, ordained for him, and hath entered the gardens of Paradise by the command of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and hath grasped the handle of divine knowledge, and hath been saved from the imaginings of the people of possibility, uttering the praise of his Lord, the All-Bountiful.This is the Day whereon God hath manifested Himself unto all things through all names, and hath called the peoples of the world to the direction of His Most Great Name, and hath guided them to His Most Straight Path, and hath summoned them unto Him through His most perfect and complete utterance. Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the greatest veil and hath attained unto that which was ordained for him by the Lord of Destiny, and hath turned towards His most luminous direction, detached from all that pertaineth to the world of man, seeking to recognize the hidden Mystery, hoping for the shade of his established Lord, and content with that which hath been ordained and commanded for him. He, verily, hath been saved from the depths of idle fancies, hath recognized the Hidden Name, hath attained unto the Treasured Secret, and hath entered the Protected Station beneath the shade of the Lord of all that was and shall be.This is the Day wherein the Sun of Guidance hath dawned and the mystery of the Beginning hath been revealed at the End, and the hearts of the people of understanding have been illumined by the light of Revelation. Blessed is he whom the veils of glory have not prevented from turning unto and drawing nigh unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, on the Day of Return.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou Who cannot be described through human utterance, nor mentioned by the tongues of all who dwell within the realm of creation! How can I describe Thee when I behold that the most precious gems of praise are unworthy to approach the court of Thy glorified majesty? How can I make mention of Thee when I witness that the most wondrous expressions of remembrance cannot ascend to the kingdom of Thy eternity? Were the discerning and clear-sighted one to contemplate what Thou hast deposited within existence from the traces of Thy power, this would suffice as proof of Thee and as testimony to Thy greatness. Verily, he who is experienced needeth not descriptions and remembrances to know Thee, O Thou Who art the Possessor of the Kingdom of Glory and Power! Should he reflect upon himself and witness the greatness of his Lord's handiwork, he would be guided by these signs to the knowledge of mysteries; the veils would be lifted and he would behold Thee seated upon the throne of power and authority.O my Lord!

This is a bounty that cannot be equalled by aught in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and a matter beside which nothing can stand in the world of creation. Thou hast said - and Thy Word is the truth - \"Whoso quickeneth a soul is as though he had quickened all mankind.\" How much more so for one who quickeneth prepared souls and guideth pure hearts to the direction of Thy knowledge, O Lord of all created things! Neither pen nor ink can reckon what Thou hast ordained as the reward for this exalted matter and wondrous station.I beseech Thee to protect Thy loved ones beneath the shadow of Thy protection and care from the evil of the wicked among Thy creatures, and to strengthen them always through Thy confirmations to stand firm in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the oppression of nations may prevent them from turning unto Thee, O Possessor of the Most Great Name!

There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.O beloved of the heart! That which was adorned with the traces of ink hath been received, making clear what was in thy heart of the subtleties of love and affection. Days had passed without the presence of thy letter and thy gracious address. I take God, my Lord, as witness that at all times I was awaiting the arrival of news and inquiring about thy circumstances from all who came from various directions.

There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.When I read thy sweet letter, I attended the court of the Lord of Lords and presented it before His Face. Thereupon, the fragrance of grace was stirred and the ocean of bounty surged, and there was revealed for thee that which shall endure throughout the duration of attributes and names, and shall be with thee in the hereafter and in this world.

Protect him beneath Thy sheltering care from the oppression of Thy creatures, and grant him always the blessing of Thy tender mercies and the pure waters of Thy loving-kindness.

Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Holiness doth speak in the most exalted Paradise with sacred and sweet melodies. By God! Whoso entereth beneath the shadow of but one leaf of the leaves of the trees that have been raised up in this Garden which hath appeared in this holy, lofty, inaccessible, most pure, most luminous, most holy and wondrous court, verily around him shall circle the inhabitants of the Supreme Concourse, then the denizens of the realms of eternity, then they that abide upon the Ark of Grandeur, then the sanctified realities and the embodiments of them that are nigh unto God, then the spirits of the Prophets and Messengers. And thou, ascend thou with the two wings of holiness and soar in this atmosphere wherein no atom moveth but it proclaimeth the Truth, even as the Tree of Eternity proclaimed at the divine Lote-Tree: \"There is none other God besides Me, the Holy, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\"Purify thy sight, O servant! By God, there hath appeared that which hath not appeared in all the worlds, and there hath been uttered the Most Great Word, through one letter of which the suns of past and future generations were raised up, and none hath comprehended it save My All-Knowing, All-Wise Self. Through it have appeared the words of God and been attracted the hearts of them that have detached themselves from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and drawn nigh unto this Beauty, the Mighty, the Holy, the Luminous.Deprive not thyself of the sanctuary of God, and cut not off thy portion of that which hath been ordained for thee. Therefore, gird up thy loins to exalt His Word, then cry out between the heavens and the earth with the call of them that are enraptured, that thou mayest attract by thy cry the hearts of all created things and turn them to the holy direction, the seat of mighty glory. However, O thou who believest in God, first recite thou these verses with the melodies of eternity, that thou mayest be attracted within thyself and attract thereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding. And if thou art not attracted within thyself, thy word will not encompass the servants nor affect the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. Thus have We commanded thee, inspired thee, remembered thee and given thee glad tidings as a bounty from Our presence, and I am the Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.By God! These are the words of the Primal Point revealed anew from His tongue in this holy, radiant, most luminous Temple. Strive thou within thyself not to deny that through which thy faith and the faith of them that acknowledged and confessed what was revealed unto Him of the verses of God, the Great, the Firm, the Wondrous, were established. And whoso denieth a single letter of these words hath denied the Primal Point, then His Book, then His proof, then Him Who sent Him with the truth. This is what the tongue of truth hath spoken with knowledge.Therefore ponder within thyself: can the name of faith be applied to them that have denied these verses? Nay, by My true Self, if thou art of them that know! And shouldst thou find them that have acknowledged the Bayan and all that is therein denying that which is now revealed in truth, beware of them, shun them, and remain safely protected. Neither let thyself be consumed by the fire of their souls, nor sit with them, nor draw nigh unto them, for their likeness is as the likeness of the serpent - should anyone draw nigh unto it, it would instantly bite him. Guard thyself against these and their like.

Those who are nigh unto Him yearn for tribulations in the paths of God even as the thirsty yearn for the Kawthar of God's mercy, and as the suckling babe yearneth for its mother's breast. Thus have We given thee glad tidings in truth, that thou mayest be of those who rejoice. We verily gave thee glad tidings in the prison and showed thee in thy dream thy release therefrom and thine attainment to the pinnacle of the Cause in those days, if thou hast not forgotten what thou didst see and art of those who remember. Thus doth God protect whomsoever He willeth through the hosts of the heavens and earth and deliver him from the hands of the idolaters. There is none to protect except Him; He guardeth whom He willeth through His sovereignty. His is the creation and the command, and all things are preserved with Him in tablets of imperishable glory. Beware lest thou forget the favor of thy Lord or deprive thyself of this mercy which hath preceded all created things and which every blind and seeing one who is just may perceive. Take the love of thy Lord and preserve it in thy heart, and exchange it not for aught else of what hath been or shall be created, that thou mayest profit in thy commerce through the love of God, thy Lord. Otherwise thou shalt be in manifest loss. Arise to serve the Cause, then take this Tablet and enter into the presence of those who have veiled themselves from the Concourse of the Bayan. Say: O people! I have come to you from the right hand of divine authority with a momentous message which is, in truth, supreme. Then recite unto them the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Revelator, the Mighty, the Wise. And when thou hast recited them unto them say: O people! If ye possess a proof greater than this, bring it forth and be not of those who tarry. O people! Be fair and deny not this Dayspring which hath shone forth upon the horizons with the lights of God, the Sovereign, the Dawning, the Mighty, the Luminous. By God the Truth! All that ye possess of the signs of God is proof of Him, were ye of those who know. O people! Have mercy upon Him, then upon yourselves. Those who have risen against Him from all religions suffice Him. If ye help Him not, ye will not harm Him. Be not of the oppressors. Fear God Who created you for His Revelation and took from you His covenant in the atoms of the Bayan, and before that in the atoms of the Furqan, and before that in the atoms of the Gospel, until it reacheth the primal atoms. Thus was the matter, were ye of those who know. And if ye believe not, deny Him not, nor wage war against His person. Fear God, O concourse of believers! Nay, by My life! These will not be content with anything, and will soon rise in discord and emerge from the thicket of hypocrisy with swords of steel. Thus have We made clear unto thee the matter with manifest proofs and decisive verses, that thou mayest become aware of that which is veiled from the eyes of the world. Preserve thou this Tablet, then read it and take comfort in it, and be of those who remember. Thereby will God resurrect thee on the Day of Resurrection in His presence and protect thee from the earthquake of the Hour. This verily is a great bounty.

Yet ye have not been mindful of that which was sent down in the preserved Tablets of glory. Apart from what was revealed in the Tablets, ye have not seen him whom ye took as lord unto yourselves, nor have ye understood him or his condition. By God the Truth!

Say: Hast thou not heard, O idolater, that He was cast into prison four times in the path of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Praised? In each instance there befell Him what had befallen no one before Him, as witnessed by the dwellers of the cities of eternity, and beyond them, My Own invincible, mighty, and peerless Self. Apart from imprisonment, I stood against the enemies in My days, and there fell upon Me at every moment arrows of hatred and rancor from diverse peoples, as ye have heard and are among those who have heard. And beyond what befell Me at their hands, there hath befallen Me at the hands of the people of the Bayan that which cannot be recounted in words, as the Tongue of the All-Merciful beareth witness, were ye even among the deniers. Whosoever possesseth the least discernment would testify that My standing firm against the enemies in days when the hearts of men of understanding were sorely shaken was better than the worship of the Concourse on High and all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Name of Victory! Know thou that in My days My food was but morsels of My own liver, and My drink naught but the blood of My heart. Yet We concealed all this from Our servants, and God is witness and well aware of what I say. Say: Fear ye God, O people, and commit not that which none before you hath ever committed. Take hold of the tablets of God with might and turn not unto that which floweth from the pen of the calumniators. They have disbelieved in God, therefore hath been sent down concerning them that which hath been sent down, and verily it is a revelation from One mighty and powerful. Say: O people of the Bayan! Were ye not commanded in the tablets of God to behold Him with His own eyes and not to be veiled on the Day of His Manifestation by what was revealed in the Bayan, nor by its letters and mirrors? Yet ye have violated God's covenant and His testament, and have clung to fancy and desire, and become of those who have turned away. Say: His words can never be confounded with the words of any other, and that which hath appeared from Him beareth witness unto His own Self, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Fear ye God and render not your works vain, and spread not corruption in the earth after its reformation, and be not of those who are veiled. Say: All things have been stirred by the breezes of God, and every barren land hath been made verdant by the vegetation of His bounty, and every withered tree hath borne fruit through fruits holy, incomparable and wondrous, while ye have made yourselves deprived of the fragrances of those days and forbidden from the sweet scents that have been wafted from the direction of your All-Merciful Lord, and ye have been of the heedless ones. Say: Would that ye had contented yourselves with this! Nay, by the Self of God! Rather have ye arisen to turn away in such wise that at every moment ye hurl at His body the darts of hypocrisy, as though ye were created from the fire of hell. Say: Verily your All-Merciful Lord, should He desire to take a handful of dust and raise from it what was and what will be, is able to do so through His sovereignty, the Mighty, the All-Encompassing. Beware lest ye slay the Self of God; if ye believe not in Him, oppose Him not and be not of the ignorant ones. Say: O company of those who have turned away! The dwellers of the all-highest Paradise now witness your evil state and place their fingers of remorse and bewilderment between their teeth by reason of what hath appeared from you in this Manifestation which hath appeared with the truth with a holy and glorious adorning. If ye fear not God, then be ye ashamed before these, that haply ye may find a way unto Him Who occupieth the throne. And thou, O servant, ascend on the wing of inner meanings unto the heaven of utterance, then help thy Lord, the All-Merciful, with whatsoever thou art able, and be not of the patient ones. Strive within thyself to soar unto a station wherein thou shalt behold those who have turned away and what they possess beneath thy shadow, and wherein thou shalt find thyself in an atmosphere of holy and subtle grace. Leave behind the worlds and whatsoever is therein, then journey in this atmosphere which hath been spread through the will of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Beware lest the coldness of the allusions of the deniers extinguish the heat of thy love. Be thou consumed at every moment with the heat of My love, then drink at every instant from the wine of My bounty, then soar at every hour in the atmosphere of My companionship, then hearken at every minute to My melodies from the direction of My Most Great and Supreme Throne. Say: Blind is the eye that beholdeth not the gleaming lights of its Lord's countenance, the All-Merciful, and deaf is the ear that heareth not His verses, and severed is the tongue that moveth not in His remembrance. The praise of Him has made blind the eye that would not see His splendor, and has clipped the wing that would not soar in the atmosphere of His knowledge, and has broken the neck that would not bow before the manifestations of His sovereignty - He Who hath encompassed both the first and the last. Thus do We make mention of thee at a time when sorrows have compassed Us round from every side to such extent as to prevent Us from remembrance, and God is sufficient witness to what I say. And the Glory rest upon thee and upon them that have held fast unto the Most Great Ark which hath sailed upon the sea of grandeur through My Most Glorious Name, and were of them that have attained.\n\n=== END BH00854 ===\n\n=== START BH00855 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, wisdom and utterance!Blessed are they who have found shelter beneath the Sadratu't-Tuba, and happy the state of those servants who have drunk from the choice wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Blessed are those men whom the might of the mighty hath not withheld from the All-Possessing, the Most High, and blessed are those loved ones who are illumined with the light of certitude and repose beneath the Tree. Blessed is that company who have detached themselves from the world and who gaze toward the horizon of the Will of the Ancient Lord, and blessed are those companions who were and are vigilant in executing the commandments of God - who fast at His bidding, who eat with His leave, who arise in His service, who speak forth His praise, and who breathe with His love. Blessed are the lovers who have traversed the horizons, land and sea, and have attained the supreme summit and ultimate goal. Blessed is that company whom the parties of the world have not prevented from hearing the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha. Joy be to those souls who are adorned with the dust of prison. Blessed are those feet that have attained to this land and inhaled from its atmosphere the fragrance of divine verses. And blessed are those souls who have borne tribulations in the path of the peerless Friend - they are the mountains of God's grace, glorified be His majesty.O people of God! Today the Luminary of utterance is shining forth and the ocean of the Most Merciful's mercy is surging. Happy the state of the soul that hath attained and been adorned with steadfastness. Blessed are those servants who in this wilderness have uttered the blessed words \"Here am I, O God of the worlds,\" and blessed are those men who have drunk from the Kawthar of this land and reposed beneath its trees. Blessed are the wayfarers who, on this day - the ninth day of the month of fasting - have been gazed upon by the Most Great Luminary from the supreme horizon of the world and been illumined by Its rays. Joy be to those emigrants who, with permission, set forth and bore the hardships of travel until they attained to that which was recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Book. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who are expectant of the Cause and who have borne the burden of fasting for the sake of God, who have been content with little and have forsaken much in the path of the All-Informed. An ocean of mercy be upon those souls whom the idle fancies of the world have not prevented and whom the veils of the peoples have not withheld from drawing nigh - who with the arm of certitude have shattered the barriers of doubt and turned toward the supreme horizon. An ocean of light be upon those servants who have aided the Cause of God through their deeds and character.\n\nO Muhammad! Upon thee be My Glory and loving-kindness! These are the days of fasting, formerly designated as the Month of God. We beseech the True One to aid all to observe that which hath been revealed in the Book by the Most Exalted Pen. The mention of each one floweth forth today from the tongue. Give them glad tidings from the Wronged One and illumine them with the lights of thy Lord's utterance, the Kind, the All-Merciful. O Muhammad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the One, the Single!The letter of Abdul-Husayn, upon him be My Glory, which he wrote to thee was noted. We found it adorned with the mention of God, His loved ones and His chosen ones. Well is it with him! He hath spoken the truth, and I am the All-Knowing Witness. He made mention of Mirza Ali-Akbar, upon him be My Glory. Praise be to God, they have drunk from the choice wine of certitude and have turned toward the horizon of the All-Merciful. The dust of idle fancies prevented them not from the Lord of all beings.We make mention of Muhammad who hath attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to strengthen him and aid him with the hosts of the unseen. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The clamor of the world held him not back from the Ancient Lord. They rent asunder the veils and shattered the idols. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him in that which will draw him nigh unto Him and to ordain for him that which He hath ordained for His near servants.At this hour We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Ali, and We remind him of My verses and give him the glad tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy. Verily, he hath attained unto that which was recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath turned and attained. We beseech God to aid him in reforming the world and guiding the peoples, and to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Powerful.We make mention of him whom We named Habibullah in the world of creation and in the Book of Names, as a command from Us that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. When thou hearest the call from the Most Exalted Horizon, say: \"Praise be to Thee, O Lord of all beings and Creator of the heavens, for having mentioned me time and again and honored me with that which nothing in existence can equal. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy grace, and by the station which was honored by Thy presence and whereon was established the throne of Thy grandeur, to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\"We make mention of him who loved Me and attained My presence and circled round Me and spoke My praise, and We give him the glad tidings of God's grace and mercy. Verily, he was named Husayn in the Book of God, the Lord of Lords. O Husayn! The Wronged One mentioneth thee at this time with that which will draw thee nigh unto Him. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: \"Unto Thee be thanksgiving and praise, and unto Thee be glory and splendor, O Thou Who art the Beloved of those who are in the heavens and on earth.\" Blessed art thou and blessed is he who heareth thy words concerning this Most Great Announcement and this Cause at which the limbs of the evil ones have quaked.\n\nO Muhammad! The letter from Abdul-Husayn concluded with mention of Amin. Verily, We make mention of Husayn and We make mention of Amin who hath attained to the service of God, the Lord of all worlds. He hath mentioned My loved ones with manifest humility. In all his letters he hath spoken in praise of the friends of God, beseeching divine grace and loving-kindness for each one. We beseech God to aid him, that through the light of detachment he may become the cause of unity and concord. Blessed is he who uniteth hearts and souls. Whosoever acteth in this supreme service for the sake of God is recorded in the Book as one of the people of Baha and the companions of the most exalted Paradise. We convey Our greetings to the friends of God in the Land of Ta and its surroundings, and counsel them to that which will exalt the Cause of God. O people of Baha! With the hosts of wisdom and utterance, summon the peoples of the world to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Dispel the doubts and vain imaginings of the past, and strive that perchance the loved ones of this Cause may not be afflicted with that which afflicted the people of former times throughout the ages. They claimed truth, yet ultimately pronounced the death sentence. Now too the deniers of the Bayan walk the same path, clinging to doubts and vain imaginings. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from the evil of those who behold the Sun yet deny it, who see the signs yet turn away therefrom. They are indeed in manifest loss. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon him and upon those who have migrated in My path and have attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Exalted Seat.\n\n=== END BH00855 ===\n\n=== START BH00856 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Sacred, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!The heart and eye have been gladdened by the perusal of thy letter, which was adorned with the ornament of remembrance and praise, and embellished with the mention of God, the Lord of all names. Each of the hearing, the sight, and the heart hath received its share therefrom. By thy life! The eye hath been illumined by beholding it, the heart hath been gladdened by reading it, and the ear hath been delighted by hearing what it contained of the mention of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to favor us with meeting thee once again and to grant us the fountain of thy reunion. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.Furthermore, when thy most luminous letter, O thou who art beloved, arrived through the grace of the All-Merciful at the most auspicious time, namely the days of Ridvan, it brought boundless joy, gladness, and delight. We praise Him for His wondrous favors. What blessing is greater than for the loved one to be honored by the mention of his Beloved? As the honored Ismu'llah-i-Javad (may the glory of the Lord of creation rest upon him) hath said, may this blessed custom ever endure. All that thou hadst written was presented before the Throne, and unique and exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will for all the souls mentioned in thy letter, and were dispatched. Praise be to God that they have become the cause of this greatest bounty and the means of this supreme gift. The Merciful outpourings have ever been and will ever continue to stream down from the heaven of divine favors. God willing, may all attain unto them and receive their portion in the days of God. For every soul who departed from these parts bound for those regions, a wondrous and exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will and sent, and was presented to thy honor. Similarly from the direction of the Land of Ha, but since affairs in that region were delayed due to the absence of the friends in the Land of Ha, they have not reached thee. Previously, when the way was open, a Tablet containing one of the mysteries of the Cause was sent sealed, but as was mentioned, it was delayed in the Land of Alif and Sin. Therefore the original revelation is being sent sealed at this time, and that too will arrive, God willing, from the direction of the Land of Ha. According to His command, thy honor must make every effort that souls who are among the people of God, enkindled with the fire of divine love and adorned with wisdom and proper conduct, should proceed to certain cities and villages for the purpose of teaching, as remembrance is necessary in all conditions. He hath said that this has been and will be among the most important matters. Should one of the assured and articulate souls proceed to the land of Kaf and Ra, which is near Ya, for the purpose of teaching with wisdom and utterance, it would be most pleasing. His exalted Word states:O Mahdi! As We were walking in the Most Great Prison and turning toward the nations and cities of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, We detected from the land of Kaf and Ra a foul odor. May God quiet it and transform it through His authority. Verily, He is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This indicates that someone has concealed within himself that which We do not wish to mention. Verily thy Lord is the Concealer, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Although We gave glad tidings to the servants in Our Most Holy Book, which was sent down wondrously from the heaven of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds - We said, and Our word is the truth: O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, behold thee in a state which God doth not approve, and witness from thee that which no one save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, perceiveth, and discover that which passeth in the most secret of secrets. With Us is the knowledge of all things, inscribed in a perspicuous Tablet. Grieve thou not because of this. God shall raise up within thee such as will make mention of Him with steadfastness, whom neither the censure of the divines nor the doubts of the perverse can deter. These shall behold God with their own eyes and will aid His Cause through their own selves. These, verily, are of those who are firm in faith.It was stated that there are susceptible souls in those parts. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto it and is among those who remember. Concerning what was written about printing, when presented before the Most Holy Court, it was stated that although We have commanded that the divine books be written in the finest script and most exquisite adornment, yet now it is necessary that they be printed, for without this the spread of the verses of God would be delayed.His honor hath indeed expressed proper thoughts, and what he hath written accordeth with wisdom and prudence. However, the means for this are presently delayed. First, souls must be found who are highly skilled in printing. Secondly, the means should be employed according to whatever his honor deemeth advisable in this matter. If the aforementioned souls are truly proficient in printing to the utmost degree, let them proceed; perchance God will gather His means.Furthermore, an exalted Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of divine bounty, designated as the Most Holy Book. A copy thereof hath been sent to his honor. What more can this evanescent servant say about the tone, majesty and power with which it hath been revealed? God willing, they will become familiar with it and attain unto its hidden and scattered pearls. By the truth of His own Self, the worlds cannot equal it. Following the revelation of several verses concerning ordinances, which at this time it was not expedient to circulate, these were, by command, removed, and markers were placed at each location until such time as it may be fitting to restore them.His honor Aqa Jamalu'd-Din, upon him be the Glory of God, hath for some time attained the Most Holy Court, and a copy of that Tablet was given to him. It is commanded that if qualified, prepared, and detached souls are found, it is permissible to show them the Tablet, otherwise not, for prior to the exaltation of the Cause, the circulation of certain matters is not permitted. God guideth whom He willeth unto the straight path. The bearer of the Most Holy Book and Tablets was his honor Amin, upon him be the Glory of God, the True King, the Manifest. Indeed, he and his honor Mulla Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, have borne the utmost hardship in the path of God. Their trade hath profited them, both outwardly and inwardly.\n\n=== END BH00856 ===\n\n=== START BH00857 ===\n\nThis servant has never desired aught but truthfulness and justice from any of God's servants, and it was known to your honor that no negligence, within the bounds of possibility, was shown in serving any of the emigrants, and every effort was made to satisfy each one, especially the kindred. Nevertheless, my brother wrote to various quarters that he had been wronged, denied his stipend, and that attempts had been made on his life. And if you were to say that you are unaware of the secrets and do not know, it has become sufficiently clear and evident to you that all these accusations they have written are pure falsehood, and he intended to cut down the divine Tree. You are also aware that this servant has never withheld bread and stipend from any soul, let alone from the kindred. By God, besides Whom there is no other God! After you left, whatever was received from the government was distributed among all the inhabitants of this land, both emigrants and brethren, and I personally never used anything save a small portion set aside for the sacred household. And it reaches my brother and others every month. Nevertheless, specifically to undermine the Cause of God and to beg from people, he has written such calumnies to various quarters. The account of Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani, which you are aware was sent every month - O Ahmad! Hearken unto the holy, eternal melodies. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings that the deeds of Truth are distinguished from all else, were men to perceive. The Truth writes to various quarters that they do not give him his stipend. Nay, by My life, the All-Merciful, if ye but knew! Alas for him and those who follow him! If ye show the least particle of fairness and reflect upon what he has written and attributed to this servant, ye would understand all his words and deeds, for ye know that what they have written is pure falsehood. If veils of fancy have prevented people from understanding certain matters, you were present and witnessed with your own eyes that this servant was never pleased with anyone's harm and never withheld anything from any soul. Now consider what this person has brought upon this servant during these successive years. By God, O Ahmad! Throughout all days I strove for his protection and honor while he stood ready for my death and harm. And this was not confined to him alone - from every soul to whom the utmost love was shown, there ultimately came to this servant that which came not from any manifestations of negation to the Ancient Beauty. And of what you witnessed that could have rent asunder the veils of the servants, you never spoke, while you related, either by your own words or his, that which caused or indicated harm to this servant. O Ahmad! Verily thy Lord is ever watchful. O Ahmad! Know this much: the calumniators of this Manifest Beauty have never prospered nor shall they ever prosper. Soon thou shalt see. Nothing whatsoever escapeth God's knowledge, and He, verily, knoweth what is in the hearts.\n\nIn truth, what hath been desired of you and others by the True One is that ye should mention that which ye have witnessed and perceived, and in no wise depart from equity. Praise be to the Ancient Beauty Who, on diverse occasions, made evident and manifest His station unto you. First, the story of Dhabih, your brother, and second, the Persian writing which was penned in response to the poem of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali. Now judge with fairness: one who comprehendeth not the meaning of a poem, as thou thyself hast discovered, yet thou didst take his part and remained heedless of the truth. By God, O Ahmad! My love for thee hath moved My Pen to counsel thee, that perchance thou mayest speak the truth among the peoples of the world. O Ahmad! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy and be not of those who, though the Truth is manifest, resplendent and evident this day, hasten from distant places to visit mere dust, and at times relate fabricated miracles, yet consider themselves the most God-fearing and exalted among all people. O Ahmad! Speak thou with truth and be not the cause of people's delusion. The world is not worthy of falsehood. Be not of those who fashion idols with their own hands and then fall prostrate before their own creation in worship. What difference is there between such people and those who utter fabricated words in praise of one in whom naught but vain desire is evident, that they might establish their words among men, and then bow down in worship? Between these two groups there is no difference in the sight of God, for one group worships what their hands have fashioned, while the other worships what their tongues have contrived. Woe unto them for what they have earned in their vain life. Soon shall they return to their abode - evil indeed is the abode of the idolaters and the liars.\n\nO Ahmad! Every soul is characterized by that which pertaineth to its faith. And if thou wouldst observe with a penetrating vision, whensoever the Truth, exalted be His remembrance, describeth any soul, He hath but described His own Self, and this is the divine revelation of love which He hath manifested upon all created things through His beloved name. And any soul that turneth toward the Sun of this name, the rays of that Sun become manifest within it, and whatsoever description the Truth, exalted be His grandeur, bestoweth upon this soul is but a description of the rays of revelation of the Sun of His own name. And these stations and attributes endure so long as this revelation endureth, and after that soul turneth away from such confrontation and the rays are extinguished, it becometh, in the sight of God, as though it had never existed and never shall exist.O Ahmad! Sanctify thine ear from vain imaginings and hearken unto the holy melodies of the Beloved, and ponder: never in all creation hath such a Cause appeared, nor shall it ever appear, save as thy Lord willeth. That which proceedeth from the Truth is clearly distinguished from that which proceedeth from falsehood. The melody of the Holy Spirit hath different breathings and different winds.Account not the false as true, nor suppose that which is spurious to be the source of truth. O Ahmad! The breathings of truth are clearly evident and distinguishable from falsehood. Hearken unto the call of the true and trusted One, and regard all else save God as non-existent. Abide beneath the shade of thy Beloved and be at rest. Behold the Cause of God with thine own eyes and with thine own ears comprehend its melodies. Know the Truth through the Truth itself. Say: O people! Know God through God, for whoso desireth to know Him through aught else shall never know Him.We hope, God willing, that thou wilt turn from the most fragile of ropes unto the Strong Handle that none can break, and that thou wilt not remain deprived of the clouds of divine mercy. And God guideth whom He willeth unto the straight path. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00857 ===\n\n=== START BH00858 ===\n\nO friends of God in Bahramabad and its environs!In the Name of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting!O people of God!

Verily your Lord heareth and seeth what hath befallen you in this Most Great, Most Holy, Mighty, and Perspicuous Revelation.

Take ye My Book with My power and sovereignty, despite Mine enemies who have cast behind their backs the Lord of all beings and have taken that which they were bidden by the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. In these days various Tablets have been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to aid all to take hold of them. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.In the Land of Ya there occurred that which caused the denizens of the Kingdom to raise their cries and lamentations. Glory be to God! What heedlessness hath encompassed them and what doubt hath appeared, that they have regarded supreme loss as profit and have imagined the most grievous illness to be healing. However, God, exalted be His glory, transformed wrath and anger into triumph and victory. Now in that land most are caught in the consequences of their deeds - some aware, others heedless. God shall soon seize them with justice from Him and authority from His presence. He is, verily, the Just, the Wise. Blessed are they who have held fast to divine counsels and exhortations, and who have shown patience in times of tribulations and ordeals. These are the people of Baha. Soon shall they witness what God, the Forgiving, the Merciful, hath ordained for them.O people of God! Know ye and recognize your worth and station. By My life! In the Supreme Kingdom all are occupied with your mention and engaged in your praise. No good deed hath ever been or shall ever be lost in the sight of God. Three clear Tablets have been revealed for the martyrs of the Land of Ya. One of these shall be sent to that region that the friends may read it and become aware of the patience and resignation of the sincere ones and the monotheists.O My Most Exalted Pen! Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy unified friends among Thy tyrannical servants, and Thou knowest what hath befallen them in Thy path in Thy days, and Thou hearest what the wicked among Thy creatures and the wolves of Thy earth have said and continue to say regarding them. I beseech Thee by Thy Call which was raised before the faces of all mankind, and by Thy Most Great Name which hath encompassed earth and heaven, and by the Word which Thou didst manifest from the Tree in the Mount of Knowledge, and by the Fire which spoke to the Son of Imran, to aid Thine enemies to return unto Thee and to acknowledge what Thou hast sent down in Thy Book, and to open before the faces of Thy friends the doors of Thy grace and mercy. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things and by Thy mercy which hath preceded all existence to rain down upon Thy chosen ones from the clouds of Thy generosity the rains of Thy glory and bounty.

Hear My call from this Castle which hath been built in this Name, whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save those whom God preserved through a power from Him and a sovereignty from His presence. He, verily, is the Protector, the Succourer. We have made mention of you in Tablets whereof none knoweth what hath been ordained therein save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness that the darkness of the earth and its vicissitudes shall not frighten you. Thus have ye been commanded aforetime and in this clear hour.O friends of God in Kaf and Ra! Hearken unto the call of this Unlettered One, Who hath arisen to the Cause through a power that hath rendered the servants powerless and a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and the earth. Beware lest human affairs prevent you from the remembrance of God, the Lord of Destiny, or the might of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment weaken you. O My loved ones! Hear the call of the Wronged One with such hearing that neither oblivion shall overtake it nor change alter it. This is the Day of assistance. Ye must arise with complete devotion to serve the Cause and guide the people of the world to the horizon of the loving-kindness of the Lord of all beings with spirit and joy. The parties of the world sacrifice their lives and their possessions for specific causes, yet the people of Iran, through God's grace and loving-kindness, have attained unto the Lord of all causes and the Sovereign of Revelation. Nevertheless, some are observed to be fearful, some troubled, and some hesitant. Hear ye the call of the Wronged One and rend asunder the obscuring veils with the fingers of power and might, and make for the most exalted homeland. This is the Day of Revelation, the Day for the manifestation of hidden matters and treasured secrets. Blessed is the soul that hath gained the pearls of divine utterance and attained unto that for which the world was created. Now doth this Wronged One counsel all anew regarding the means which lead to the exaltation of being. O people of God! Know ye and recognize the station of religion, trustworthiness and truthfulness. These mentioned attributes are each the foremost adorning of the human temple. Ye must preserve them in the name of God from thieves and betrayers. Verily, He commandeth you that which profiteth you and hath revealed for you that whereby your mention and your names shall endure in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Repeatedly hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto that which hath had and hath no peer or likeness. Say: O loved ones! Know ye the value of these days. Ye must become so enkindled by the heat of the verses of God that their effects become manifest and evident from the horizons of the world. Today the Sadrih (Lote-Tree) speaketh and the Mount circleth round, and He Who conversed on Sinai is established upon the throne of utterance. Say: O people! Fear the All-Merciful and be not among the ignorant. Thus hath the Pen spoken, whilst the Wronged One was in this exalted station. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have not broken My covenant and My testament, and upon those who have testified to that whereunto God hath testified: There is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great.\n\n=== END BH00858 ===\n\n=== START BH00859 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most PowerfulPraise that is sanctified above manifestation, appearance, tongue, utterance, perception and minds, befitteth Him Who is the Desired One of the world, Who hath raised high the banner of \"Verily I am God\" in the most exalted station of the world.

Through the power of the Most Exalted Word He took possession of the cities of hearts - that is, the hearts of those who have turned towards Him and are sincere, and likewise the hearts that were concealed behind veils. The fire of His love burned away the veils, and the light of His proof illumined the realm of wisdom and utterance. Glorified be His dominion and great be His power! Glory be to God! The Euphrates of bounty is flowing from the Supreme Pen and the ocean of inner meanings is surging with the waves of divine utterance, and yet the people of the earth are debarred from beholding and are deprived of understanding.Glory be unto Thee, O Mystery of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the treasuries of Thy utterance and by the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge, to aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee, that they may hearken unto Thy call and follow Thy commandments. Unveil for them, O my God, even as Thou didst unveil for them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creatures. Then assist them with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.O My beloved! Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto that which hath no peer or equal. Thou hast drunk from the cup of contentment, as attested by the Lord of Names, and hast arisen to serve His Cause. Well is it with thee and pleasant it is to thee. Since His Honor Aqa, His Holiness the Servant, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was not present - being occupied with other writings - therefore, as bidden, this servant hath written these few words and troubled thee. In the nights and days I beseech the Desired One of the worlds to rend asunder the intervening veils and guide His loved ones, that all may gather beneath the pavilion of glory and the canopies of grandeur, and be occupied with His remembrance, praise and service. The cause of these dispersions, separations, divisions and estrangements is the deeds of the people of the world and the ingratitude of the nations. Yet in all conditions the hand is raised in supplication, the tongue is pleading and the heart is hoping. The Command is in His grasp. Whatsoever appeareth hath been and is beloved.The letter which that spiritual beloved sent to His Honor the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was presented in the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being heard. These are the pearls of the ocean of the Most Merciful's mercy that have appeared from the mine of grace. His blessed and exalted Word: \"O Haydar-'Ali! We are well-pleased with thee.\" Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto this most exalted Word, which the world and all that is therein cannot equal. Praise the Wronged One of the world and say: My God, my God! Thou didst call me while I was sleeping, and didst awaken me while I was slumbering, and didst raise me up while I was sitting, and didst cause me to speak while I was silent, and didst move me while I was still, and didst teach me while I was ignorant. Which of Thy favors shall I mention, O my Goal and my Beloved, O Ultimate End of my desire, my Quest and my Hope? I beseech Thee by the lights of the throne of Thy grandeur and the effulgences of the Orb of Thy Revelation to accept from me what I have wrought in Thy path, though I confess before Thy face that there hath not appeared from me what is worthy of Thy days and befitting Thy service. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy bounty and generosity to adorn what hath appeared from me with the ornament of Thy acceptance, as a token of Thy mercy and an evidence of Thy favors and kindnesses. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be the eternal glory of God! Thou didst mention going to Yazd. Thou must be exceedingly mindful of wisdom, for there they are specifically appointed to observe. As a matter of wisdom from Him: \"Associate not with one who desireth not to meet thee.\"No news hath been received for some time from his honor \\[Ali-Rida\\], according to outward appearances. We have been with him in all conditions, in his grief and joy, in his difficult days and his bright days. He hath not been forgotten. Make mention of him on behalf of the Wronged One, and if thou proceedeth to the Land of Ya, convey greetings. We beseech God to assist him, aid him, and ordain for him that which will bring solace to the eyes of the cities of justice and equity. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.The glances of loving-kindness have ever been and continue to be directed towards the friends. To this testifieth every discerning mystic and every informed sage. Previously several Tablets were sent, and now more are being sent. Deliver them to steadfast, firm and resolute souls, that they may be illumined by the lights of the Luminary of utterance, the Goal of all worlds, and be seen as free and detached from the troubles and sorrows of the world of dust.O Haydar-'Ali! How far removed are the aims of the Wronged One from the deeds of the people! Recently the Shi'ih sect hath been renewed. A people like that people - may God forsake them - have appeared. The same names as before have come forth. Thou hast seen the fruits of the Shi'ihs' deeds and that station which He declareth to be sanctified above the mention, utterance and understanding of the people of the earthly realm and the Kingdom. They have abandoned Him and occupied themselves with vain imaginings. Would that they had acted upon but one word of the utterance. He saith: \"I have written a gem concerning His remembrance: verily He cannot be indicated by My allusion, nor by what was revealed in the Bayan.\" Beyond this station, they have occupied themselves with mention of guardian, successor, chiefs and nobles.In brief, the purpose of the Wronged One is to transform the fire of hatred in the world's heart into the light of love. This Cause moveth above the religions of the world. This Bird hath another nest, and this Tongue another utterance. Ask of God that He may enable the immature ones of the world to attain unto maturity, that they may recognize who is the Speaker and who is the Bestower.Convey greetings on behalf of the Wronged One to his honor Sin, and likewise to Mim if thou shouldst meet him, otherwise not. End.This servant is truly immersed in the ocean of wonderment, for the ignorant servants, heedless of the Revelation, know not what hath come to pass and what hath been manifested from the unseen realm into the visible. Had they known, they would have proclaimed with their outer and inner tongues: \"Verily, we are God's, and to Him do we return.\"In previous years his honor \\[Ali-Rida\\] - upon him be the glory of God - sent a letter mentioning the departed and elevated Siyyid Javad-i-Karbila'i - upon him be the glory of God - that the polytheists had said he was of the party of the deluded ones. Therefore, by command, his petitions that he had sent to the presence of the Servant - two petitions, one of which detailed the delusions of the dawning-places of vain imaginings - were sent that they might observe and become aware of the people's calumnies, and afterwards that honor should keep them in his possession. I beseech God to assist them in rendering victory, that is, to draw the servants, through wisdom and utterance, to the path of the Goal of the worlds. This servant also offereth greetings and conveyeth salutations to them. Some of the Tablets are in writing between revelation and other than that, which his honor 'Abd al-Hadir hath written.Majd\n\n=== END BH00859 ===\n\n=== START BH00860 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most PowerfulPraise be to the Goal of the worlds Who hath manifested in that land whatsoever distinguisheth those who have turned towards Him from those who have turned away, the truthful from the false, the slanderers and corruptors from the reformers. All those corruptions are clear and evident, their source being from the Island and his disciple who is in that land. Now that honored friend must ponder who is the guide and who the guided. I beseech God to make manifest penetrating vision and to sanctify some eyes from the ophthalmia of self and desire. O my brother! The path of God is clear and evident from all else. The turning away souls deem it necessary to lie and slander, as thou hast witnessed and dost witness. They have attributed to the Afnan - whose sanctity and purity every fair-minded one doth testify to - that which all the atoms of creation bear witness is false. Inform the people - meaning those souls who were and are in other cities - that perchance they may become aware and hold fast to righteousness and piety instead of tyranny and wickedness.O my God, my Adored One, my Object of worship! Purify Thy servants from falsehood, doubt, hatred, tyranny and wickedness, that they may turn from what they possess to what Thou possessest. Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty. O God! Thou knowest the intentions of the sincere and obedient among Thy servants. Have mercy and confirm all servants generally in truthfulness, trustworthiness, sincerity and purity. Thou art powerful over that which is the cause of salvation for all. Disappoint not those who hope in Thee and deny not those who seek Thee. Verily Thou art God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.The letter of that spiritual friend arrived. Christ said to His disciples: \"O sheep of God, I wish to send you among wolves.\" Now what hath befallen that spiritual friend is even greater than that. However, after the presentation of that friend's letter before the countenance of the Master, He said: Be not grieved by what hath befallen thee, and despair not of God's justice. His justice shall ultimately seize the oppressors and liars, and His grace shall not deprive His loved ones. He is the Owner of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen. Speak thou of truth with complete assurance and perfect trust and resignation, and remain firm and steadfast in setting affairs aright. Verily He aids every oppressed one, every trustworthy one, and every truthful one. Hold fast to the cord of His favor which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! Praise God, glorified be His majesty, that thou hast become aware of the deeds and actions of the Island. Behold what his disciple doeth. They have ever been and continue to be engaged in corruption. Trustworthiness, religion and truthfulness are as rare as the phoenix among that party, as thou hast witnessed. Say: O my God, my God! Aid the slanderers to truthfulness, the oppressors to justice, and the treacherous to trustworthiness. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nThe honored gentleman, his holiness the Afnan, has arrived and attained the presence, and will soon return. Concerning all the persecution inflicted thus far - that is, from those individuals who received the utmost love and kindness from the honored Afnans, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God - they showed patience and left it to God. However, praise be to God, all that was falsely claimed has become clear and evident to all. By God's grace, what they have said has become known to the wise ones and the manifestations of justice. Glory be to God! They consider their honor to lie in persecuting this community, for this community has had and has no one but the Truth. Due to having no helper or supporter from the earliest days until now, they have endured what none but God knows. The oppression of this community reached such a point that in one city, on the word of a single attendant, twenty people were martyred. In any case, persecuting the oppressed is easy and unimpeded, but if at any time or moment the sun of justice should appear or shine forth, the deeds of all will become clear and evident. Glory be to God! This servant is greatly astonished that in that city, not enough just and fair-minded souls can be found to protect even one oppressed person. Despite the Afnans' acknowledgment - upon them be God's peace - of the kindness and love of His Excellency the Iranian Minister (may God strengthen him), how is it that such matters occur? Someone wrote from Beirut about a telegram that caused astonishment, for the Iranian Consul himself has risen to harm his own subject and has accused him of theft. What has been observed thus far is that those souls who reside in these parts have been and are the most obedient and best subjects of the exalted government of Iran. However, these matters are proof of their oppression and the manifestation of the stations of the detached ones. That spiritual friend should act with justice and fairness in all conditions, speak with truthfulness, and ask from God whatever they hope and long for. We beseech God to assist you and make you successful, and to make you helpers of His Cause through compassionate counsels and wise advice, and through virtues that have won the glory of acceptance and pleasure before God, Creator of heaven. In all matters we have trusted in Him and committed our affairs to Him, and in the nights and days we pray for those who have risen to humiliate this community, and we ask God not to deprive us and them of the adorning of justice. If deemed advisable, mention to His Excellency the Deputy and First Vice-Consul that this latest action of Muhammad 'Ali in making accusations of theft is true testimony to the truth of their previous actions. However, by way of counsel I submit that in all cases the honored Iranian ambassadors (may God strengthen them) should exert their utmost effort in protecting individuals and preserving dignity and station, for if they are subjects, they are God's trust with them, and if they are not subjects, human compassion requires kindness. From first arriving in this land until now, ask the ambassadors of the exalted government who have come to these parts - this community has been and remains obedient in all aspects, and whatever befell them they bore with patience, and how many incidents occurred in that land that were inappropriate yet not a word was said, meaning no complaint was raised, for whatever\\[...\\]\n\nInasmuch as what has transpired is, in its truth or falsity, as clear and evident as the sun, these few words were penned in the hope that after being submitted to those in authority, they might become informed of what has befallen this wronged community. In any case, under all conditions, we thank God and praise Him, and beseech Him to grant success in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\n=== END BH00860 ===\n\n=== START BH00861 ===\n\nIn the Name of God\n\nupon Him the Glory of God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Great!\n\nGlorified is He Who remembers the people of faithfulness while in the prison of His enemies, and turns toward him who has turned to Him from this far-off place. He is the Beloved of every lover, the Goal of every seeker, the Object of every search, and the One gazed upon by all in the heavens and earth. We have turned to him who turned to the Qiblih of existence, and We have welcomed him who sought his Ancient Lord. We have loosened the reins of the Pens in praise of the Lord of all beings and of those who heard the Call and said: \"Yea, O Lord of the sincere ones!\" My Pen moves at all times to make mention of those who have believed in the All-Merciful, after We were opposed by servants who found not the fragrance of justice and who rose up in tyranny. They are indeed in manifest loss. We have lit the lamp with the hands of power and might, and by it the heavens and earth were illumined. We have taken the gems of creation by Our power and left the dross. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty.O My Name! When the Call was raised at this time from the Dawning-Place of the Will of the Lord of Names, We heard the call of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation in the inmost mystery - exalted be the Glory that hath appeared through His Most Glorious Name! Blessed is he who hath heard and hearkened, and blessed is the thirsty one who hath hastened to the Kawthar of God, the Unique, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: By His call were attracted the realities of the Divine Realm and the essences of those who dwell in the Empyrean and the Kingdom. Before His face they cry out: \"Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of the lover and Herald to him who conversed with God!\"O My Name! We have lifted the decree of killing lest anyone slay another or oppose another soul, yet despite this supreme prohibition what was destined came to pass. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Those who were killed in this land, by God, were slain by the swords of their own deeds - to this testifies every informed sage. Thou knowest how the fire of corruption was kindled and how they violated the sanctity of God and His chosen ones, until they were seized for their evil deeds and words. He is verily the Just, the Wise. We protected them for numbered years while they persisted in hypocrisy to such an extent that We sat alone in the house, closed the doors and drew the curtains. Then the fire of opposition intensified until God seized them by His authority. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. Say: O people! Spread not corruption in the earth, consume not the wealth of others unjustly, and slay not God's servants. Thus doth command you the Lord of creation in a perspicuous Book. Hold fast to the cord of righteousness - this is better for you, if ye be of those who are certain. Should the barking of dogs and squealing of swine be raised, leave them to themselves and turn to God, the King, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. None should oppose another - leave the idolaters to their vain imaginings. He aids whom He willeth through His authority and seizes those who disbelieve. He is indeed the severest of avengers. Victory hath been ordained through remembrance and utterance - thus hath commanded the All-Merciful. He is verily the Ruler, the Mighty, the Invincible.\n\nO My Name! They who are veiled today, these are in grievous error. Consider the Concourse of the Bayan: We desired to raise them to that station which God hath sanctified above all names and to make them the inheritors of the Kingdom among the worlds. They clung to such illusions as they possessed from before - verily they are among the perishing ones. They violated the Covenant of God and turned back on their heels when the horizon of Revelation shone forth with the Sun of the remembrance of thy Lord's Name, the All-Subduing, over all who are in the worlds. Among them is he who followeth his desires, turning away from guidance, and We behold him wandering in the valley of opposition, among those who stray, after having failed to understand the root and branch of the Cause - verily he is among those who tread the paths of fancy. Say: Abandon the illusions ye possess and hold fast to pure certitude. They have cast the All-Giving behind their backs, hastening unto the wolves. Such is the state of the people - verily they are among the heedless ones. O Most Exalted Pen! Cease the mention of these ones - it behooveth not Thy wondrous pen to move in remembrance of them.\n\nO My Name! If thou seest Judi in those regions, convey to him My greetings, then gladden him with My remembrance through which the fragrances of Paradise have wafted and all atoms have proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!\" O Judi! The Cause is mighty, mighty indeed - none can bear it save he who hath cast away all vain imaginings and all that he hath heard from the tongues of the speakers. Say: This is the Originator of the heavens and earth. Through Him the banner of origination hath been raised above every lofty standard. O Judi! Arise from the horizon of detachment in My Name, then attract the hearts of those who are nigh through My remembrance and My sovereignty. Thus doth thy Ancient Lord command thee. Leave the people behind thee, turning unto God, the Lord of all beings, speaking forth His Name amongst the worlds. O Judi! The Most Great Ocean hath surged in the name of the Lord of the Ancient Days and casteth upon thee the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Spread wide the garment of thy heart that thou mayest gather them in My Name, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Arise with such arising as will cause the tribes of the earth to quake, and aid thy Lord through His power that hath encompassed both worlds. When thou desirest to be seated, sit upright in the gatherings, uttering this remembrance through which the Unseen hath appeared and the Kingdom hath proclaimed: \"For My Own Self, the Mighty, the Beloved.\" Thus have We commanded thee in standing and sitting, that thou mayest speak forth in all conditions this Announcement at which all existence hath been shaken, save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, willeth. Say: O people! This is the Day of God. Cast aside what ye possess of succession and trusteeship and the like. By God! Nothing should be mentioned therein save His Self, the One Who dominateth every witness and witnessed thing. Cast aside the idle fancies of the ignorant and that which the widows of the earth have spoken, then turn with radiant vision toward My Most Great Horizon that ye may behold the Lord of Destiny speaking from this exalted Station. Say: All names are shaken on this Most Great Day, and all attributes are overwhelmed, save for him whom the hand of thy Lord's loving-kindness hath taken, the Strong, the Victorious, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: This is a Day wherein none save God alone should be mentioned, if ye but knew. Thus have the waves of the ocean of utterance surged and the winds of wisdom and explanation blown, as a grace from Us upon thee. Be thou grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of existence. Numbered years have passed and thy letter hath not reached Our presence. This beseemeth not one like thee, for thou hast been beneath the glances of thy Lord's loving-kindness every morn and eve. Read My verses with joy and fragrance. By God! Thou shalt find from them the fragrance of the All-Merciful and be detached from all possibility, speaking forth this forbidden remembrance. O My Name! If thou seest him, deliver unto him the verses of thy Lord; if not, send unto him what hath been revealed in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. In every land thou visitest, convey My greetings to My loved ones and give them glad-tidings of God's verses, that they may stand firm in the Cause in such wise that neither human limitations shall prevent them from turning toward the realm of Oneness, nor shall trials move them from the Lord of the seen and unseen. Thus it behooveth the people of God in this promised Day. Verily, the glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned with their hearts to this praiseworthy station.\n\n=== END BH00861 ===\n\n=== START BH00862 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and magnificent His bounty!From time immemorial unto everlasting ages, the essence of praise and the substance of glorification befit that Eternal Lord Who hath illumined the mirrors of the hearts of them that are sincere and devoted with the effulgent rays of the Most Exalted Word. He is sanctified above all mention and utterance, and exalted above the comprehension of all created things. Every praise and glorification that proceedeth from the pen or tongue of the people of the age is bounded by the limitations of contingent being. Exalted, immeasurably exalted, is He above being described by the mention of His creatures or the praise of His servants. Verily, the mention of the world is not worthy of Him, yet since it is by His command, it is acceptable unto Him. Otherwise, how can a drop describe the Ancient Ocean? How can an atom describe the World-illumining Sun?When the Ocean of God's Primal Will turned towards creation and its adornment, and the refinement of souls and their preparation, He ordained the Supreme Pen as His first interpreter and commanded it to promulgate His laws and ordinances. These laws and ordinances have had and shall have no purpose except the preservation of souls, their comfort, education and advancement to the heights of certitude, which are the cause and reason for the prosperity of the world, its security and the perpetuation of existence. This is so that the human soul, which is reckoned among the gems of the divine mine, may be adorned with goodly attributes sent down from the heaven of God's Will.Among these commandments hath been and shall be the decree of detachment from all else but Him, for detachment among virtues is as the sun among the stars. It is the true educator and the cause of the training of the peoples of the world. It is the source of sanctification and the dawning-place of purification. Should a soul attain unto this station, his influence pervadeth the world, and the penetration of his remembrance is swifter than lightning through all things, and more potent than the spirit's influence in the body. For me to describe this ocean would be like a feeble sparrow attempting to describe the Divine Kingdom. Exalted, immensely exalted, is His mention above my tongue, His knowledge above my comprehension, and His praise above my pen and utterance.Yet despite the ignorance and unworthiness which this servant doth confess, I testify with absolute certainty that should a single wave arise from this ocean, or should a breeze waft from this paradise, it would perfume the world and endow all who turn unto Him with everlasting life. It is the cause of the turning of heedless souls, the renewal of ancient creatures, and the enkindling of extinguished hearts. It is the reason for the arising of the seated ones, the cry of the silent ones, and the hastening of those who tarry.I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, with a hundred thousand tongues, that He deprive not the hearts of His loved ones and chosen ones from the radiance of this Sun, and that He may bestow upon all the sweetness of this station. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nThis lowly one submits to your eminence that this servant was blessed with your handwriting, which caused joy and happiness and was the cause of delight and gladness. I beseech God to assist you in His service, His remembrance and His praise as He loves and is pleased with. In these days His Honor Haji Mirza Muhammad Husayn Tabib, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], arrived from Tehran. Praise be to God, the loved ones of God and the drinkers of the wine of inner meanings have been engaged in the remembrance and praise of the True One, exalted be His glory, and they are adorned with the ornament of well-being. According to what he mentioned and also the petitions that were with him which had been submitted to the Most Holy Court, they expressed satisfaction with the source of outward authority, namely His Majesty the Sultan, and likewise with his son who is known as the Na'ibu's-Saltanih. Outwardly, after the release of the prisoners, the Na'ibu's-Saltanih summoned some of them several times and conversed with them, treating them with the utmost kindness and affection, to such an extent that when a person from the Land of Ta \\[Tehran\\] spoke unfittingly about the friends, he was ordered to be banished. That person went and took refuge in the house of Siyyid Sadiq. Later the friends themselves interceded for him and he was released. The aforementioned person desired to examine some of the revealed Books. When these matters were mentioned both verbally and in writing, this servant submitted them, but \"excellent is what was said: even if all created things become unbelievers...\" etc., for what appears from the actions and utterances of the Desired One, may the spirit of all in the world be sacrificed for Him, is other than these matters and is sanctified above comprehension and minds. Even though in these days He has come forth from the Most Great Prison with the utmost power and first adorned the garden with the ornament of the Greatest View, and then proceeded to a palace which is more elevated than all the palaces of these lands and is renowned in these realms, nevertheless one day He uttered a word which this servant himself heard, and that word indicated and proved that He preferred the Most Great Prison. In this case, what station do the world's acceptance or rejection have? If certain evident and manifest matters which are hidden from most were to be submitted, all who are on earth would be astounded. Glory be to Him Who made me know and prevented me. The sea of outward knowledge is visible while people cling to the cord of ignorance, and the sun of grace is shining while most turn away from it. I know not whether they are confused or they are dead. And if you wish for news of the Land of Purpose \\[Akka\\], it is as before, except that strife and contention have caused upheaval and disorder. Some roads have been closed and foods which people need have reached high prices to such an extent that the scent of famine can be perceived. However, in the presence of the True One, exalted be His glory, the friends have had and have no fear of this matter. Although the people of the city have deserved every kind of affliction, His grace has preceded their deeds, their actions, their existence and their being. Verily He is the One Whose tongue has spoken in the kingdom of His utterance: \"Verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful.\" The items that were sent arrived, but your honor has taken much trouble in sending them. What is intended and desired has been the turning of one's being to God and the recognition of that which benefits them, and no jewel has been or will be more excellent and lofty than a heart turned toward God. If you take one gem like this gem from its mine, it would be better than all the jewels of the world.\n\nAfter the submission of petitions at the Most Holy Court, perfect grace became manifest from the horizon of bounty, and then He said: \"God willing, they must, in the Name of God, rend asunder the veils and barriers of the people, that all may behold the Sun of Divine Utterance from the horizon of proof, and become illumined by its rays. And may the illusory human imaginings of the divines, which are in truth the very essence of veils and the reality of barriers, be effaced and vanish, and the effulgences of the Sun of Certitude be witnessed.\" End.

No one who remembered Him was deprived of His grace, and no seeker was denied from the ocean of His verses. His bounty hath encompassed all and His mercy hath preceded all. Throughout the nights and days He hath perfumed those who have drawn nigh with the fragrances of revelation. Exalted, exalted be His bounty, and exalted be His mercy! Great is His glory and mighty His proof! O thou who hast turned unto God, who hast drunk the cup of His presence, and who speaketh in His praise! Hearken unto His sweetest call from His most exalted horizon. Verily, He remembereth thee with verses that call out to the world and summon all to the Mighty, the Bestower. We have remembered thee time and again that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Master of all necks. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present hath read it. We have answered thee with a Tablet which God hath made the Mother of Tablets. Grieve not over anything, but put thy trust in God, the Lord of Lords. He hath aided thee to make mention of Him and to praise Him, and hath made thee a cup-bearer of this choice wine which, when its seal was broken, perfumed all regions. Blessed is he who hath sought the Desired One and attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to reach. Say: The verses are subdued by His command and all affairs are in the grasp of His power, and He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thou hast attained unto that which the divines and scholars of the earth have failed to attain. The Mother of the Book beareth witness to this in the Final Return. The names that were mentioned in thy letter were presented before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for them that which attracteth the hearts and solaceth the eyes, and He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. O Muhammad-'Ali! Take what is approved and leave what is denounced. This is what thou wast commanded in the Qayyumu'l-Asma and in this perspicuous Tablet, before which all other Tablets bow down. Thy Lord is verily the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. O 'Abdu'l-Ahad! Take justice and abandon tyranny. Thus hath the Command flowed from the Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds. He hath remembered thee with that which no remembrance in the world can equal. Thy Lord is verily the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli! When thou hast drunk the choice wine of reunion and attained unto that which was treasured in God's knowledge and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in His Books, His Scriptures, and His Tablets, render thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty.

Thus hath come the irrevocable decree from God, the Lord of eternity and Master of nations. He is the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.O Ahmad! The Prisoner hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the prison and saith: Leave the dead, and take the cup from the Kawthar of life in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful.

The Desired One of the world hath appeared with the banners of grace and bounty, and the standards of glory and guidance, yet the people have cast the Command of God behind their backs and have committed that which they were bidden by the Daysprings of oppression.

Hearken unto the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen. Take hold of the Book of God with such might and power as cannot be hindered by the power of the world nor the authority of nations. Verily, thy Lord is the Commander, the Ancient of Days.O Ismail! Blessed art thou and blessed is the servant who, having cast away vain imaginings, hath turned his face toward the horizon whence the Sun of Certitude hath shone forth on a Day whereon the Straight Path hath proclaimed: \"By God! The appointed time hath come,\" and the Balance hath declared: \"The veil hath been lifted,\" and there hath descended from the heaven of might a perspicuous Book.O Muhammad! Remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, all who dwelt on earth turned away from Him. Some declared that He had disbelieved in God, others pronounced Him a lying impostor, while yet others called Him a sorcerer who spoke from selfish desire. Thus did the people speak concerning His Cause - the firm, the sacred, the mighty, the wondrous.O Pasha! The Lord of all beings remembereth thee on this darksome night, and remindeth thee of that which will draw thee nigh unto a station honored by the mention of God and adorned by the presence of His loved ones. He speaketh at all times, saying: \"O people of creation! Lift up your heads and behold that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge from the presence of One mighty and powerful.\"\n\nO Faraj! The gate of heaven hath been opened and relief hath come with such sovereignty that before it can stand neither the hosts of creation, nor the ranks of the mighty, nor the vain imaginings of the learned. He proclaimeth in the most exalted voice between earth and heaven: \"O people of creation! He hath come at Whose advent the limbs of all names have trembled, and He Who was mentioned in the hearts of them that are nigh unto God hath appeared.\"O Mulla Baba! We have accepted the tribulations and hardships of the world for the salvation of the servants, yet they have risen in opposition. They have denied God's proof and His evidence, disputed His signs, turned away from the lights of His countenance, and disbelieved in His Self. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are among the most lost in the Book of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.O Samad! Hearken unto the call of the Eternal, the Single, the One, the Unique. He commandeth thee that which will exalt thee, and counseleth thee to observe God's covenant and His testament, and that which hath been revealed in His Book. He is with those who have held fast unto His commandments and acted according to what they were bidden by the Tongue of Revelation in this blessed, holy and manifest Day.O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Aqa Mulla, that Thy remembrance may draw him to the most sublime summit and bring him nigh unto Thee, and strengthen him in that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure, and aid him to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped, faces have been darkened, and the idols of the deluded have fallen.O Qanbar! Take hold of trustworthiness in My name and set aside whatsoever is contrary to it. God hath made it the primary adornment for the temples of all religions. Blessed is he who hath clung to it, recognized its station, been illumined by its light, and grasped its hem. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken while seated upon the throne of utterance. He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.O Abdul-Ahad! Remember the days wherein thou didst attain My presence, hear My call, behold My horizon, and drink the choice wine of meeting from the hand of My bounty. Beware lest the affairs of the world prevent thee from My remembrance and praise, and from that which thou didst hear from My tongue in this My prison. This We commanded thee before, and at this time We command thee again, by the leave of One mighty, powerful and praiseworthy.\n\nO Mashhadi Hussein! Take hold of faithfulness as a command from the Creator of heaven. Blessed is the temple adorned therewith, the hand that graspeth it, and the servant who recognizeth its station, by the command of God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Verily We have desired to make mention of him who hath been named Mulla Islam, to remind him of My verses, to bring him the glad-tidings of My favors, and acquaint him with My Kingdom and My Dominion, and with the dwellers of the cities of My power and grandeur, that he may rejoice and render thanks unto Him Who hath come with the truth with a sovereignty that hath encompassed earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath recognized and borne witness and hath said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!\" O Shaykh-i-Kazim! We counsel thee with wisdom and utterance, and with that whereby thy remembrance shall endure in the Book of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Let not the might of the world dismay thee; place it beneath thy feet and say: \"My God, my God! I render Thee thanks inasmuch as I have inhaled the fragrance of Thy verses, beheld the tokens of Thy Pen, and acknowledged that which Thy tongue hath spoken. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art wronged throughout all regions, by Thy Name through which necks have been subdued, to assist me to remember Thee and to stand firm in my love for Thee. O Lord! Deny me not the ocean of Thy bounty, nor the heaven of Thy generosity. There is none other God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving.\" Verily the Wronged One desireth to make mention of him who hath been named Mulla Nur-Muhammad, that the breezes of Revelation may draw him to the Most Sublime Horizon, and that he may hold fast unto that which hath been ordained by Him Who is the Creator of heaven and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. The world shall pass away, but that which hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty and generosity shall endure for those who have turned unto Him. To this testify honored servants upon whom neither fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. O Ali! This is the Day of remembrance and utterance, the Day of bounty and bestowal, the Day of majesty and glory. Blessed is the servant who hath turned unto Him, attained, and acted according to that which hath been ordained by God, the Lord of existence. O Abdul-Hussein! Blessed art thou and blessed is thy name. Hear with the ear of the heart that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of the favors of the Lord of creation, Who hath come with the standard of unity and commanded all to be united. Happy is he who hath held fast unto that which hath been ordained by God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.\n\nO Hassan! Say: \"My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy sealed wine, and by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, and by the Kawthar of Thy utterance, the Salsabil of Thy knowledge, the milk of Thy bounty and the wine of Thy mercy, to make me, in all conditions, well-pleased with Thy good-pleasure, turning unto Thy horizon, speaking of Thy verses, and holding fast unto Thy extended cord.\"O My Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Ali-i-Akbar, whom the veils of glory prevented not from the All-Glorious. He heard the call from the Most Sublime Horizon and turned unto Him on a day wherein all who dwell in the kingdom of creation turned away, save those whom the hand of power had seized and whom the tongue of grandeur had mentioned in his praiseworthy station.O Ali! We counsel thee and them that have believed to fear God and to observe truthfulness and sincerity. Thy Lord desireth for no one save that which will raise him to the All-Highest Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven - the station wherein naught is seen save the manifestations of His names and attributes. He is the All-Bountiful One Whose bounty is not withheld by the opposition of the peoples nor by the happenings of the world. His mercy hath preceded all things and His favors have encompassed all, but the people, they understand not.O people of Shishan! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful. He remembereth you while He was in the hands of those who turned away from godliness and followed wickedness and corruption, and committed that which caused the countenances of the Most Exalted Paradise and the All-Highest Heaven to lament, and caused the Tree of Blessedness and the Divine Lote-Tree to wail. Beware lest the tyranny of the transgressors and the harm of the ungodly dismay you. Lay hold on wisdom in the days of God; verily it will draw you nigh unto Him, did ye but know.O Haji Aqa! Hear the call from the precincts of the Prison. It summons thee to truth and bids thee observe justice and equity. He hath appeared and manifested that which He desired before the faces of all men on a day whereon the clouds of destiny rained down the arrows of tribulation. To this testifieth the Preserved Tablet that is with Him.O Mulla Sadiq! From My Most Exalted Pen hath flowed the river of wisdom and utterance on a day when every seeker turned away, every confessor denied, every believer disbelieved, and every silent one reviled. Thus did We receive treatment from those who showed no justice in the Cause of God and His sovereignty, and cast equity behind their backs, cleaving unto that which caused the Spirit to lament in His holy, glorious, and beloved station.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! Behold and remember when the All-Merciful came with power and sovereignty, and there befell Him at the hands of the people of tyranny that which caused the rocks to cry out, the earth and heaven to weep, the hearts of the chosen ones to tremble, the great cry to be raised, and every lofty and towering mountain to be scattered.O Ja'far! Thy name was mentioned before Our face, and there hath been revealed for thee that which cannot be equalled by the treasures of the earth, nor the riches of creation, nor that in which the wealthy pride themselves in the material world, nor that which princes and kings have amassed. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say: \"My God, my God! Deprive me not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and render me not destitute of that which draweth me nigh unto Thy horizon. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving!\"O Aqa Bala! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. Blessed be thy face for having turned, thy heart for having advanced, thine ear for having heard, and thy hand for having manifested the power and might of God, which the whole world cannot equal. To this doth this Wronged One testify in this exalted station. Rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance which hath flowed from the Pen of God, thy Lord, the Possessor of the seen and unseen.O Ibrahim! The Friend hath come from the presence of the Glorious One, yet the people denied Him and turned away from Him, disputed that which appeared from Him, and disbelieved in Him Who sent Him with the truth, until the fire of hatred was kindled in the breasts of the people of tyranny and wickedness, and they committed that which caused every loving one to lament and every friend to cry out. Thus was the matter decreed, while most of the people mention but do not perceive.O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Mashhadi Ibrahim, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, Who is established upon the throne of utterance in the final return. We counsel thee with that which will elevate the station of man and with that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. Grieve not at anything, but trust in God in all matters. Verily, He will assist those who have turned unto Him on the day when the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of Lords!O Taymur! The All-Forgiving maketh mention of thee through His remembrance and remindeth thee of His signs, and counseleth thee to show forth love and affection, unity and concord. Blessed art thou for having heard and turned towards Him, and woe unto every denier who hath disbelieved in God and His signs, turning instead to the dawning-place of vain imaginings.\n\nO Mansur! Victory hath come, and it is My manifestation; triumph hath come, and it is My call; sovereignty hath come, and it is My command; and the mysteries have appeared, and they are My Book. Thus have We brought forth the pearls of proof from the shells of the ocean of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.O Fayyadh! The All-Bountiful has come with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. The Herald has called out from every direction, the mountains have been moved, and the Balance has been set up, yet most people are in a strange sleep. Their desires have prevented them from God; they have cast the Book behind their backs and have committed that from which the dwellers of the pavilion of grandeur and majesty have disassociated themselves. The glory rest upon you, upon your family, and upon My handmaidens who have believed in God, the One, the Chosen One.O Muhammad-'Ali! Hear the call of the Wronged One. The Cause of God has come, which was a fortress for those who arrived and an armor for the temple of whosoever turned to the Most Sublime Horizon and answered the Lord of all beings when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. Say: O people! Recognize the station of God's Cause and His wisdom, and be not of the ignorant. Thus has the light shone forth from the kingdom of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory rest upon thee and thy wife from the Forgiving, the Merciful.O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Darvish Rahim, that the verses of his Lord may attract him and draw him nigh unto Him, and strengthen him to make mention of Him and to praise Him among His servants and to serve His Cause in His days. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. The glory from Us be upon him and upon his wife, whose name was presented before the Wronged One in His mighty prison.O Darvish Khalil! The Cause of God hath come, yet the people have turned away from it and opposed it, having broken His Covenant and His Testament, and followed those who denied God and His signs. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. We make mention of thy wife who turned towards Him on a day when most of the handmaidens of the earth turned away. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Mirza Aqa! We have desired to make mention of thee from this direction and to remind thee of God's verses which were sent down from the kingdom of His utterance, that thine eyes may be consoled thereby and thy heart may rejoice, and that thou mayest arise with spirit and fragrance to serve the Cause on this Day wherein the appointed time hath come, the verses have been sent down, the clear proofs have appeared, and the earth and heavens have spoken. Thus have We sent down that which shall endure as long as My most beautiful names endure. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the Generous.In the name of the One All-Knowing God!O Sulayman! Hearken in the Persian tongue to the utterance of thy Creator. Today the mystery of the Self-Sufficient is manifestly revealed without veil. Blessed is the state of the one who hath drunk the sealed wine in the Most Great Name and hath remembered Him in the Most Great Prison. The dust of divine chastisement hath encompassed the world and smoke hath overtaken it. Beseech ye Him that perchance His forgiveness may encompass all and make them aware of that which is the purpose of creation. Make mention of the kinsmen on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of the verses of the One Peerless Friend.O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! That which was hidden hath become manifest. The primal light hath appeared therefrom. Blessed is the state of the one who hath heard His call, turned towards Him with his heart, and faced the lights of His countenance.O Rasul! Various colors have prevented the world from turning to and drawing nigh unto the horizon of God's Cause and have deprived it from the ocean of the utterance of the Creator. Beseech God that He may aid His servants in that which beseemeth His Day. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.O Siyyid Qabli-Muhammad! The Pen hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee that thou mayest hold fast unto that which is befitting and attain unto the station of \"Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses.\"O Abraham! The fire of hatred that was kindled in those days hath been rekindled with greater force and intensity in the days of this Wronged One. The extinction of every fire is easy, but the fire of malice and envy cannot be quenched by the waters of the entire world. The outward fire is extinguished in but an hour, while this fire endureth through centuries and ages. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from this fire and to illumine them with the light of His knowledge. He, verily, is powerful over all things.\n\nO Mahdi! The beginning of all things hath been and shall ever be the knowledge of God, and the end thereof steadfastness, for the clamorous are lying in wait and are occupied with leading men astray. Blessed is the soul that beholdeth all else save God as non-existent and as naught. Such a one is assuredly among the people of this luminous station and this mighty and impregnable seat.O Pen! Make mention of the Merciful One, that perchance the attraction of the divine mention may so grip him that he may remain firm and steadfast in the Cause. In all conditions, fix thy gaze upon the greatness of the Cause and this Day. Blessed is he who hath recognized and inhaled the fragrance of the utterance of his All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord.O Abdullah! The Day hath come and the hour hath struck, yet the servants have failed to recognize the Lord of all worlds in this garment. All are deprived and forbidden from His recognition, save whom thy Lord willeth. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the knowledge of his Lord, who hath detached himself from the world and all that is therein, and hath cleaved unto Him. This is the station wherein shineth the light of true reliance and spiritual resignation.O Husayn! This Wronged One desireth to make mention of thee - in what station? In the Most Great Prison - in what condition? In the midst of sorrows. Yet the tribulations of the nations and the tyranny of the world have not withheld Him from remembrance. The atoms of all created things bear witness to what hath been mentioned. Beseech God to aid thee in that which beseemeth His station.O Ali! Hearken with the ear of the spirit and observe with the eye of truth, that perchance thou mayest hear the call of the Friend and behold His traces. How many are the servants who have eyes and ears, yet in the divine ledger are recorded as blind, deaf and dumb.O Muhammad! The Book hath been sent down and its mysteries recorded by the Most Exalted Pen, yet the servants remain heedless and veiled, save those souls who with the hands of power have rent asunder the veils and shrouds and have sought the most exalted station, which is the station of recognizing the one true Friend.O Javad! The ocean of utterance is surging, the Sun of Truth is shining above all heads, and the light of bounty is radiating from the horizon of grace. We beseech God not to withhold His servants from these bounties nor deprive them thereof. His grace hath encompassed all, and the All-Bountiful is seated upon the throne of mercy. Blessed are they who possess true knowledge.\n\nO Sattar! The Day of Resurrection hath come, and the Concealer is seated upon the throne of the All-Forgiving. He hath concealed, shown grace, and opened the gate of bounty with the finger of power, yet the heedless servants have risen in tyranny. They have committed that which hath rent asunder the breasts and set aflame the livers. All these things have come to pass through the wickedness of the divines of Persia. They have wrought that which hath never been heard of since the beginning of the world. They are indeed among the most lost in My perspicuous Book.O beloved friend! The wolves of the earth have surrounded the Beloved of the world, and the Wronged One of the horizons has been imprisoned by the people of sedition. At every moment a new injustice appears and at every instant a new hardship descends. It is not known to what they turned in the past and to what cord they held fast, and now for what reason they have turned away. By the life of God, they neither perceive, nor recognize, nor know.O Husayn! Hear the call of Husayn which hath turned toward thee from the prison quarter. He speaketh for God's sake and uttereth in God's path. Are there any attentive ears to be found or any penetrating eyes present? By the Sun of Truth, the proof is manifest and evident, the bounty is descending and the mercy is showering. Blessed are they who possess sight and hearing, and woe unto the heedless.O Pen! Make mention of Allah-Quli on behalf of the Most Great Name, that perchance thy mention may assist him like wings to soar in this refined and luminous atmosphere. Thou hast heard the call and seen the signs. Ask of God that He may aid thee to remain steadfast in the greater steadfastness. He is the Most Great Sign and the Ultimate Goal. Take what thou art commanded and lay aside what thou art forbidden, as a command from the presence of One powerful and mighty.O Asadu'llah! Reflect upon the power of the Wronged One: single and alone He arose before the faces of the world, and in the nights and days His verses were revealed and His evidences were manifest without any veil or covering. He rent asunder the veils of glory and the clouds of grandeur with the finger of power, and guided all with the most exalted call to the straight path and the mighty news. He is the One Who is powerful, Whom the malice and hatred of princes and divines prevented not from the mention of God and His purpose. Reflect and say: Thine is the greatness and the glory, and Thine is the power and the grace.\n\nO Soldier! O beloved! It is hoped that in this wondrous divine Day, through the effulgences of the lights of the Most Great Name, thou wilt bestow crowns instead of being a soldier. Abu Dharr was but a shepherd, yet through one word \"I believe,\" he became the guardian of Islam's sanctuary and a guide to mankind. This is not difficult for thy Lord God.O Hassan! Speech belongeth unto the tongue, yet now the ocean speaketh and heat cometh from the fire, and at this time the sun giveth and bestoweth. Strive that perchance through God's might and power thou mayest attain thy station and become worthy of honor from God, the Lord of all mankind.O Muhammad-Baqir! The veils of names of the people of the mortal realm have prevented creation from the highest horizon. For one thousand two hundred years the odious Shi'ihs were occupied with claims of succession, deputyship and nobility, and when the Sun of Manifestation dawned from the horizon of will, bright and manifest, they arose to harm Him and issued the verdict for His blood to be shed. Fix thy gaze upon God alone, that thou mayest be recorded among the true monotheists in God's Book and be inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen.O Ali-Asghar! The Lord of Power maketh mention of thee from the Most Great Scene. The friends of the earth hastened to the Supreme Companion in their longing to hear this mention. That which floweth today from the Pen of generosity hath had and hath no likeness or parallel. Recognize its station and preserve it as the eye preserveth itself.O Ali Siraj! He says: O people of the earth! By the Luminary of utterance, I swear that the divine lamp is shining and manifest before all faces. Deprive not yourselves of its light, and through its rays and radiance, enter into the tabernacle of divine glory. Today the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful is surging and the heaven of grace is upraised. Deprive not yourselves. Pass beyond all else and hold fast unto the Friend. He is the All-Bountiful, He is the All-Merciful.O Pen! Make mention of Qasim, that haply he may drink from the ocean of utterance and be illumined by the Sun of divine knowledge, and attain unto that which is the cause of steadfastness. Today the cry is raised, the mountain is crushed, and the servants are thunderstruck. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto hearing it, recognized the Purpose, and became cognizant of Him. Beseech God to protect His servants and aid them to exalt His Word.\n\nMy God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all things, and by the lights of Thy face whereby all horizons were illumined, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy command, and by the heaven of Thy bounty, and by the sun of Thy grace, to assist me to serve Thee and to help Thy Cause, and to enable me to be steadfast in my love for Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.O Ahmad! Should anyone ask thee concerning the Manifestation of God in this Day, say: The proof hath appeared and the evidence is manifest. The Ocean hath surged and the Sun hath shone forth. The clouds have rained down their bounty and the lights have shed their radiance. Yet the blind remain veiled and the ignorant contend with the All-Knowing. We are God's and to Him shall we return.O Muhammad-'Ali! Should anyone inquire about the station of this Revelation, say: By God! This is the Day which was announced by the Tongue of Power and Might to all who are in heaven and on earth. This is the Day wherein the earth declareth its tidings and unveileth its treasures. Blessed is the ear that hearkeneth and the eye that seeth and the heart that understandeth. The people, for the most part, are heedless.Verily we have accepted thy service in His days and have ordained for thee that which will profit thee in this world and in the world to come. He is, in truth, the Gracious, the Bountiful.\n\nO Abu'l-Qasim! Say:My God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all things, and by Thy sovereignty whereby Thou didst encompass the entire creation, and by Thy Word through which Thou didst fashion Thy heavens and Thy earth, to assist me to serve Thee with such steadfastness that neither the doubts of the doubtful nor the denials of them that have turned away from Thee can deter me. Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, directing my face toward the lights of Thy countenance, and awaiting the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the Lamp which Thou hast preserved through Thy power and sovereignty, and by Thy Most Great Name whereby the limbs of the deniers among Thy servants and the idolaters among Thy creatures trembled with fear, to ordain for this servant of Thine from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art God. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.O Mir 'Ali-Akbar! Consider My Cause and that which hath befallen Me after I came from the Most Exalted Horizon for the reformation of the world and the education of the nations. Say: Alas, alas! This servant knoweth not which of Thy tribulations to mention before Thy face. The Pen is struck dumb at the mention of Thy tribulations and what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures and the rebellious amongst Thy servants. I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself for the life of the world and the reformation of the nations, and hast borne hardships to reveal Thy grace and demonstrate Thy bounty. My soul be a sacrifice for Thy grace, O Thou Desire of them that know Thee, and my spirit be a ransom for Thy Self, O Thou Who art imprisoned in the hands of the heedless ones!O 'Ali, O 'Attar! When thou hearest the rustling of My Most Exalted Pen, turn thy face toward God, the Lord of all mankind, and say: \\[...\\]O my God, my God! I know not in what mountain hath Thy call been raised, nor in what spot the throne of Thy grandeur hath been established. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Protector of the oppressed, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the cities of hearts, and by the power of Thy Will, the potency of Thy Purpose, the ocean of Thy signs and the heaven of Thy wisdom, to ordain for me that which shall make me content with Thy good-pleasure, moved by Thy will, and holding fast to the wisdom Thou hast commanded in Thy perspicuous Book. Verily, Thou art the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Abbas, that he may rejoice and be of them that are grateful. Say: O my God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having created me and manifested me and made me know Thy path. I know with the knowledge of certitude that Thou hast created me to hearken unto Thy call and witness the lights of Thy horizon. I know not, O my God, what Thou hast ordained for me of Thy decree and destiny, and what Thou hast willed in Thy days. Should that which preventeth me from drawing nigh unto the seat of Thy throne hinder me, then neither my life, nor my existence, nor my rising up, nor my sitting down would profit me. Oh! Oh! Should Thy decree prevent me from standing before the gate of Thy grandeur and hearkening to Thy call, then by Thy might, O Desire of the world and Beloved of the nations, my thirst can only be quenched by drawing nigh unto the court of Thy holiness, and my heart can only find rest by turning toward the direction of Thy throne, and my being can only find repose through the Kawthar of Thy presence and the Salsabil of Thy reunion. Thou seest, O my God, my perturbation and agitation, my sorrow, my grief and anguish in Thy days. Where is Thy relief, O Reliever of the world, and where is Thy succour, O Helper of the nations? By Thy might, my condition hath transcended mention and utterance. O my Lord, the All-Merciful! Have mercy upon me through Thy grace, then ordain for me that which shall solace mine eyes and the eyes of Thy servants. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous, and verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones who have ascended unto the Most Glorious Companion and have soared on the wings of certitude to the Most Exalted Horizon. Thy mercy hath preceded all created things and Thy grace hath encompassed all beings. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity to send down upon them at all times from the heaven of Thy gifts that which shall gladden the eyes of Thy loved ones and chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. All created things bear witness to Thy generosity. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Dominant over the seen and the unseen.Then make mention of Husayn who hath ascended unto his Lord. Ordain for him in the most exalted Paradise at all times that which beseemeth the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named Allahverdi, who turned toward My horizon and traversed land and sea in his love for meeting Me until he attained My presence and heard My call. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My traces aforetime and in this perspicuous moment. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty. The glory be upon thee and upon thy sister and her daughter, and upon those women who have believed in God, the Lord of all worlds.We make mention of My handmaidens at the end of the Tablet and give them the glad-tidings of the Day-Star of My providence which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy in My Most Great Prison.O Mulla Baji, O My handmaiden!

Rejoice in the bounty of thy Lord and glorify His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.Verily, We have made mention of the servants of God and His handmaidens, and have sent down for them that which the world and its ornaments and embellishments and all that hath appeared therein and is treasured therein cannot equal. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.We make mention at this hour of the loved ones of the All-Merciful in Milan, that the sweet savors of remembrance and utterance may draw them to a station before which all regions of the earth have bowed down in submission. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bestowing. Ye have heard the Call time and again; now hearken unto that which the Supreme Pen hath voiced. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Chosen. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have turned unto Him when most of mankind hath turned away, and have spoken in praise when the idolaters uttered that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to lament in their most exalted station. O people of Milan! By the life of God, within you are treasured the pearls of love and faithfulness, whereunto the Mother Book doth testify. We beseech God to aid and assist all, that each may arise to serve His Cause, illumine receptive hearts with the lights of the Most Great Name, and occupy themselves with the refinement of heedless souls and the reformation of the world. May they quench with the waters of wisdom and utterance the fire of hatred and animosity which hath blazed in the hearts of diverse peoples throughout the ages and centuries, that all may strive together in perfect unity for the betterment of the world. The mention of each one is remembered with God and recorded by the Supreme \\[...\\]\n\nPen that which leadeth to eternal life. Hold fast to goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. After recognition of God--glorified be His majesty--uprightness, trustworthiness and piety are His trusts among His creatures. We counsel all to preserve them. Blessed is the soul whom neither the vicissitudes nor vanities of the world have deterred from righteousness and the fear of God, and who hath attained unto that which hath been recorded and established by the Pen of Grace in God's Book, enduring throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. Know ye the value of these days and, in complete unity, occupy yourselves with the remembrance and praise of the Goal of all creation. Whatsoever giveth rise to clamor and is the cause of corruption and strife hath been forbidden in God's Book. His is the grace and bounty, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. All must associate with those souls who have taken precedence in turning unto God, in faith and in recognition, with the utmost love. This matter hath been mentioned in the divine Books of the past and future, and in the Qur'an: \"And the foremost to embrace the Faith shall be the foremost. These are they who shall be brought nigh unto God.\" Glory and praise and magnification be upon the servants of God who are nigh unto Him, and upon His sincere chosen ones who have not broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and who have acted according to that which they were bidden in His perspicuous Book.\n\nAt this moment the Tongue of Utterance in the Kingdom of knowledge turns toward the people of Sisan, and for the sake of God We make mention of them. Divine mention in one station is as the spirit for the bodies of the people of the world, and in another station is as the eternal Kawthar for the mortal temple, and in one station it is a sign of the All-Merciful for the righteous and His wrath for the wicked. Blessed are they who have heard the call and risen from the graves of heedlessness. O My loved ones in Sisan! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and hold fast unto that which is the cause of exaltation and the source of elevation. Ye are the saplings in the garden of divine favor and have been nurtured by the Kawthar of the All-Merciful utterance, and have attained unto the station of maturity which is the station of recognition of God, exalted be His glory. Preserve this station through the name of the Lord of Days and cherish it as your precious life. Soon shall all that is visible pass away, save what God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath ordained for you. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon My handmaidens whom neither the clamor of the people nor the howling of the wicked have prevented from God, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have made mention of every maidservant who hath turned and attained. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of your Lord. He heareth and seeth; He is the Single One, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty. As for certain souls mentioned who are in other lands, since the fragrance of steadfastness hath not been fully diffused from them, We have therefore destined their mention for another time and another day. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nO son of Dakhil! Praise be to God, all the names mentioned have each been blessed with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Give them My glad-tidings and illumine them with the light of My utterance. We have ordained for them in Our most exalted Kingdom that which tongues and pens are powerless to describe. To this testifieth He Who speaketh at this moment before all faces: There is none other God but He, the Single One, the One, the Dominant over all things great and small. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and say: Today is the day of mention and praise, and the day of attraction and ecstasy. Strive ye to attract the hearts of the servants through the Word of God and draw them to the most exalted horizon. We counsel all to that which beseemeth the Days of God and to the reformation of the world and the refinement of nations. Thy Lord is, verily, the Commander from ancient times. There is none other God but He, the Master of the Day of Judgment, and this is the true and manifest Cause. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon them who have cast away all else save Me and taken hold of that which they were commanded in My perspicuous Book.\n\n=== END BH00863 ===\n\n=== START BH00864 ===\n\nHe is God - exalted be His glory, His greatness and His power!\n\nO beloved of my heart! It is night, yet the sun is bright and visible, and the light manifest and clear. Glory be to God! Each of His signs is a clear book and a mighty volume. The worth of day appears through night, and its station shines through darkness. The lamp of night speaks of and indicates its station, while day itself reveals and manifests the station of day. Yet night stands opposite to day, and day opposite to night - both are limited. We seek a day that has no night following it, one illumined by the light of the Beloved's face, not by the light of sun or moon. This is the day of the Kingdom of Heaven, nay rather the Realm above, nay even sanctified above all three. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive the people of divine unity from this day.\n\nI know not whether I speak truth or utter delirious words. The fire of love is ablaze and at times seizes and takes the reins of control. It is a mighty champion and valiant horseman, its field the arena of the world, its course the realms of the seen and unseen.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O my God! Thou seest and knowest that the love of Thy chosen ones hath caused me to speak, and their affection hath emboldened me, taught me and made me speak. Were I to mention the degrees of their love in my breast and their remembrance in my heart, words would fail, ink and paper would not suffice, neither pen nor tongue could express it. I beseech Thee, O God of the world and Goal of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist them in all conditions as Thou hast assisted them through Thy grace and bounty. Then manifest through them at all times that which befitteth Thy gifts and bestowals. O Lord! I beseech Thee by them, by Thy greatest signs and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation, to assist Thy servant to act according to what Thou hast commanded in Thy Book and to remember Thy chosen ones and pure ones. Verily Thou art the Helper, the Wise. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nThe sea arrived - meaning the letter arrived. As the saying goes, I speak first and then fulfill it, for it contained the pearls of divine love. Each word was like a shell; when examined closely, it showed what was to be seen and made heard what was to be heard. By the life of our Lord! The ear is for hearing the message of love, and the eye for beholding the beloved ones of God. In any case, after its observation and perusal, it was granted the honor of being heard by the Lord. We beseech God to deposit in every heart of His loved ones a surging sea of His love, that through its waves the world may be purified and become worthy of the effulgence of the Sun of Truth. For what was the world created? For acceptance. Why did Adam come? For recognition and submission. The meaning of ink took the form of writing, the point came into being, and the point journeyed for centuries until it became adorned and when it became expanded and submissive, its head was crowned with the diadem of 'H' and the Word appeared, and this Word was honored with the name of the Beloved of the world - that Beloved by whom the night journey was glorified and the heavens were adorned by His footsteps. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid us and you, and to assist us and you in His remembrance and praise and in what He hath revealed in His Book. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The end.\n\nThe ocean hath come and the river hath departed - what can the poor and lowly one do? Where is conclusive proof, and where are these idle words? Unless His grace assist and His bounty bestow utterance upon the tongue-tied. And for what purpose is this utterance? By the life of our Lord, it is beloved for His mention and praise, for without these, speech availeth not.\n\nO my God, my God! Inspire us with Thy remembrance and praise, and aid us in that which befitteth Thy glory and majesty. Then accept from us, through Thy grace, that which hath appeared from us in Thy path and Thy love. Thou art the Generous One Who enricheth the world through a word from Thy presence, and Who openeth the door of wealth through one of Thy names. Verily, bounty is in Thy grasp and giving is in Thy right hand. Thou hast subdued all things through Thy Most Exalted Pen. There is no God but Thee, the Lord of the Throne and earth.\n\nConcerning what they wrote, that the spiritual friend Aqa Ghulam-Husayn and Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon them be the peace of God and His favors, have of their own accord requested to participate in a good deed, namely the palm grove partnership - this matter was presented and was honored with acceptance before the Lord, and these exalted words issued from the blessed tongue: \"We beseech God to strengthen their tongues for His mention and praise, their ears to hearken unto His verses, their faces to turn toward His horizon, their eyes to behold the mysteries of His creation, their hands to grasp His Book, their hearts to be enkindled with the fire of His love. And We beseech Him to ordain for them every good thing He hath sent down in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\nPraise be to God, ye have attained unto that which ye desired. Blessed be I and ye! Convey mention and praise on my behalf to all the friends in that land. God the One is witness that they have been and are remembered most of the time. Mention of that beloved one's joy in what flowed from the blessed tongue regarding the palm grove partnership became the cause of complete gladness and delight. If the joy of these words was but a drop there, here it became an ocean, for He mentioned it repeatedly and smiled. The servant beseecheth his Lord for your success and confirmation, and I beseech Him to grant you that which befitteth the heaven of His generosity and the ocean of His grace. Verily, He is the Giver, the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nConcerning the mention of Aqa 'Ali, upon him be God's peace, they have indeed accepted hardship and difficulty. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to bring forth from this hardship manifold ease, and from this difficulty and constraint, boundless facility. Verily, He is the Creator of all things, their Manifester, their Ordainer and their Educator. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you, upon those with you, upon every steadfast and firm one, and upon every resolute and trustworthy one.\n\nThe Servant\n\n10 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1303\n\nI convey greetings and praise to the honored friend Mirza, upon him be God's peace and favors, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to apply in his case the blessed words \"ten times as much\" - that is, to increase his successes, confirmations and rewards at every moment. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThe blessed Branches, may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their honored footsteps, each and every one, remember that beloved one and send their greetings.\n\n=== END BH00864 ===\n\n=== START BH00865 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord\n\nPraise be to God Who hath revealed that which He hath sent down and fulfilled that which He promised in the Books of old, such that His verses have been spread abroad and His evidences have become manifest, until the horizons were filled with the manifestations of His power and the tokens of His might and authority. Then arose the atheists in opposition and the idolators in protest. Among men were those who denied Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries, and among them were those who rejected that which was sent down from the heaven of the will of our Chosen Lord, and among men were those who disputed His verses and warred against His Own Self and pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the Tablets to lament. Blessing and peace be upon the Manifestations of His oneness, the Recipients of His revelation, the Dawning-places of His Cause and the Sources of His wisdom, whom neither the veils of the world nor the doubts of the nations prevented, and who arose to serve the Cause at eventide and at dawn.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O God of the Kingdom and Sovereign over the realms of might! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the fragrance of Thy days was diffused and the banners of Thy remembrance were unfurled, and by the ocean of Thy knowledge which none hath comprehended save Thyself, to assist Thy loved ones to celebrate Thy praise and glory, and enable them to achieve that which befitteth Thy days. Then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies who have broken Thy covenant and Thy testament. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nThereafter, thy letter was received and as it was adorned with the mention of the one true God, it brought joy. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to ever assist thee in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word.\n\nAs to what thou didst write regarding his honor Khan, upon him be the glory of God, and the corruption of the person mentioned, this servant was greatly astonished. How inappropriate! When his honor Khan departed from here, all his purpose was to aid the divine Cause, to educate heedless souls, to promote the Cause, and to adorn the servants with trustworthiness, chastity, religious devotion and virtuous character. I testify by God that he had no other purpose. This evanescent servant conveys what he himself hath understood. The person mentioned went to those parts specifically for trade, and until now no command or prohibition hath been given to him. What this evanescent one submits is pure truth, and God is witness and aware. His honor Khan must in all conditions keep his gaze fixed upon the highest horizon and arise for God's sake and speak for His sake. Whoso is for God, God is for him. No matter is hidden from God. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. They should be occupied with service to the Cause, detached from all else. The sayings of people will not harm them. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, for their success - such success that its fragrance may be diffused throughout the world. This is a mighty day; one must regard time as precious. Once this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names, blessed and exalted be His utterance: Not a moment of these days can be compared with centuries and ages past. Time and again the Tongue of Grandeur hath voiced this blessed word and others like it. In all cases I beseech repose and tranquility for His Holiness, that He may engage in promoting the Cause of the Best-Beloved of the worlds with the utmost joy and fragrance. Assuredly this prayer will be answered, but let them not abandon wisdom and let them be mindful of the blessed words \"Speak to men according to their capacities.\" God is witness that in the Most Great Scene perfect loving-kindness towards them is manifest, evident and clear. This bounty is mighty and this grace is great.\n\nThis evanescent one's petition in the presence of that honored one is that whatever hath been mentioned should be conveyed to His Excellency the Khan with greetings, praise, glory and exaltation. As for what was mentioned regarding that honored one's remembrance before the countenance of the Desired One, it was submitted at a specific time and was graced with His hearing. This is what was revealed in response, blessed be His words:\n\nO Mahdi! God willing, thou shalt attain the honor of guiding the servants. Reflect upon the upheavals and conflicts of the world. Where are the Pharaohs and the children of the Pharaohs? Where are the Caesars and the children of the Caesars? Where are they who prided themselves on what they possessed in the East and West of the earth? Where are they whom the world so deluded that they were kept back from the most exalted Paradise and what was created therein? Where is the clamor of men and the roaring of heroes? Where are their swords and their ranks? Where is their loftiness and their ascendancy? God hath brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Should anyone turn to the palace of Chosroes, he would see naught but spider webs therein, and hear naught but the echo. Take ye warning, O people of insight!\n\nThat honored one should arise with complete determination to promote and assist the Cause of the Lord of all beings - an arising that neither the doubts of the world can shake nor the conditions of the nations can cause to slip. Great is the deed, great is the reward, great is the day, and great is the Cause. Blessed is the soul whom neither the cawing of the divines nor the might of princes did hold back from the Truth. The Khan, upon him be My glory, hath been and is remembered. Every soul in those regions who hath today been blessed with the fragrances of revelation and the sweet-scented breezes of these days should join with the Khan in complete unity to teach and serve the Divine Cause, albeit with wisdom and utterance, for contention, warfare and strife have been strictly forbidden in the Book.\n\nWe beseech God to grant divine confirmation and assistance that all may find and hold fast to the path. Say: My God, my God! I am he who hastened to the splendors of the lights of Thy bounty and grace, and turned to the waves of the ocean of Thy bestowals. I beseech Thee by the dominion of Thy pen of destiny and by the fragrance of Thy garment which hath perfumed Thy servants and creatures, to assist me in Thy remembrance, Thy praise and the service of Thy Cause. Then send down upon me from the clouds of the heaven of Thy grace a mercy from Thee and a blessing from Thy presence. O Lord! Disappoint me not of what lieth with Thee. Ordain for me that which shall profit me. Verily Thou knowest what is within me and I know not what is within Thee. Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nPraise be to God that thou hast attained unto His supreme bounty, for all things and matters shall be seized by extinction save the Sun of Utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Pen of the Best-Beloved of the worlds - this alone endureth and shall endure. Each of the souls mentioned was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and all were blessed with divine remembrance. This servant too conveyeth greetings and salutations to all. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon His Presence, and upon thee, and upon them, and upon every soul that is steadfast, firm and upright.\n\n=== END BH00865 ===\n\n=== START BH00866 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down the laws and made them a stronghold for His servants and a cause for the preservation of His creation. Blessed is he who hath clung to the Book of God and acted according to what He hath commanded, and woe unto the heedless. And prayers and peace be upon the Lord of both worlds and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and the earths, through Whom the Kingdom of Names was illumined and the standard of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" was raised, and upon His family and companions, the manifestations and repositories of knowledge and wisdom, through whom cities and villages were subdued and the law of God, the Lord of all creation, was spread, and upon every steadfast, firm and trustworthy follower.\n\nAnd now, your letter arrived and the correspondences were received and given to their owners who will send their own replies. Your deeds are, God willing, accepted. Praise be to God, they are remembered in all conditions and are occupied in service. His Holiness Afnan (may all glory be upon him) sent a letter to this lowly one. Among other matters, he had written about Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ali-Rida (may the glory of God be upon him). It is hoped that a reply will be sent. I beseech God to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. In truth, he is engaged in service.\n\nThe latest news is that the beloved of heart and soul, Jinab-i-Varqa (may the Most Glorious Glory of God be upon him) was given expenses and sent to his former location. And regarding the prisoners T and R, they had written that there is complete hope that they will be released in these days. This is the news that has arrived from various directions. Knowledge is with God. However, regarding the beloved of the heart, Jinab-i-Varqa (may God's favors be upon him), a word was previously revealed from the Supreme Pen, and His Holiness Afnan has given him this glad tidings. Verily He knoweth and we know not what is with Him, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nRegarding the Tablet of Jinab-i-Haji Muhammad-'Ali (may the glory of God be upon him) from the people of Q, which they had written about, it was sent this time, and likewise the Tablet of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Isma'il Haji Malik, wherein mention was made of his deceased brother, wife and son, and likewise in other Tablets whatever needed to be mentioned has been mentioned. You will observe that God willing the rest will be sent later, and most of these Tablets this time are, as commanded, in this lowly one's handwriting.\n\nAnd regarding what they mentioned about Jinab-i-Akhund Mulla Husayn and the maidservant of God (may the glory of God be upon both of them), it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and this supreme word was revealed in response. His mighty utterance is:\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed\n\nO Husayn! The oppressed One of the horizons is surrounded by the people of discord, who with utmost effort strive to extinguish the divine light and quench the fire of the divine Lote-Tree. What benefit did their fathers and ancestors who previously girded themselves for these deeds obtain? By the life of God, they incurred a loss which cannot be remedied! The heedless souls followed suit, unaware that the Truth is ever-watchful and vigilant.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Husayn, for thou hast hearkened unto the call of Husayn--that Husayn Whose appearance after the Qa'im was promised by God to all the world. His is the Manifestation of Whom it is said that all the Prophets and Messengers will gather beneath His banner--meaning they will attain to the recognition of His Cause. Praise be to the Goal of the world and the Ancient King Who hath enabled thee to attain this exalted station and most high rank. Guard it through His Name, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nAnd likewise, addressing His handmaiden, His word, exalted be His glory, was revealed thus:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing\n\nO handmaiden of God! Mention of thee hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and in every year there hath been sent down from the heaven of divine bounty, specifically for thee, that which no earthly thing can equal. Were the friends of God to become aware and know the station of the Word that floweth from the Most Exalted Pen concerning them, it is feared they would perish from joy and gladness. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the commanding Word of God--such a one hath attained an everlasting bounty. Convey on behalf of the Truth greetings to all the handmaidens in that land and give them the glad-tidings of His grace and favor, that they may arise as beseemeth the days of God. He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path and acquainteth whomsoever He desireth with that which is hidden from the eyes of the heedless. The glory be upon thee and upon My handmaidens in thy vicinity, who were not deterred by the clamor of the oppressors.\n\nPraise be to God, the honored one, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise the leaf who is known as the handmaiden of God, have attained the bounty of the Goal of all the worlds. Blessed be they both and joy be unto them. The Afnan, upon him be from all nine \\[glory\\] most glorious, hath mentioned their two brothers and what that beloved one hath written. This evanescent one beseecheth the Truth that in this Revelation no sapling and no plant be deprived of the spring rain of His generosity.\n\nAs to what they wrote regarding whether permission is granted to bring someone on their return or not, this matter was presented. Thus did the All-Merciful speak in the Kingdom of Utterance--exalted be His utterance: We have granted thee permission in this, that there may be with thee one who remembereth God in the evening and at sunrise. God willing, may all the peoples of the world attain to the mention, praise and service of the Cause. If one faileth to attain this station, in truth his existence hath yielded no fruit and his tree hath borne no fruit.\n\nThis evanescent servant beseecheth the Exalted Truth in the nights and days that He may cause all to attain unto His good-pleasure and adorn them with this crown which is the greatest of all the crowns of the world. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nAnother submission to his honor, the beloved of hearts, Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious: I convey greetings with utmost sincerity. His letter arrived and brought complete joy. Since this servant had no matter requiring his attention, no separate letter was submitted. What he had written was the undoubted truth. I beseech God to sanctify His loved ones from that which causes their own abasement and degradation. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAll praise be unto His Presence. Please convey greetings and salutations to his honor, the esteemed and kind friend Jinab-i-Aqa Abdul-Ghaffar, upon him be the praise of God. I implore and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant him success and aid him in preserving what has been bestowed. Verily He is the Answerer, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnother submission: Please convey, on behalf of this evanescent one, expressions of utter nothingness and effacement to each and every one of the divine friends in that land. Peace, praise and mercy be upon you all, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n5 Safar 1301\n\n=== END BH00866 ===\n\n=== START BH00867 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious\n\nPraise be to God Who hath ordained victory through His consummate wisdom and hath commanded it unto all created beings who have believed in God, the Lord of Oneness. He is the One Who hath, through His grace, lifted up the decree of the sword and established in its place the decree of utterance, whereby the fragrance of His name, the Most Merciful, hath been wafted throughout all creation. Exalted, exalted is our Lord Who cannot be described by the learning of the divines and the people of mystical knowledge. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto that which God, the Lord of all religions, hath commanded in His Book. And woe unto him who hath cast aside wisdom and utterance, and through his idle fancies hath seized upon that which was forbidden him in the Scriptures and Tablets. Blessed is he who hath arisen to promote the Cause of his Lord through goodly character and deeds. The Servant beareth witness that he is among the prosperous ones in the Book of God, the Sender of winds. And praise be to God Who hath sent down from His Most Exalted Pen that which hath enraptured the sincere ones in the kingdom of creation, and hath revealed for His loved ones that which hath caused spirits to soar.\n\nThereafter, the Servant hath attained unto that which thou didst previously send, as though it had opened the gate of joy. When I read and understood and learned of it, I approached the Praiseworthy Station and presented it before the throne of our Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which pens and souls are powerless to recount, and He revealed for each name that was in thy letter that which caused the breezes of loving-kindness to waft between earth and heaven. To this beareth witness the Tablet of the Beloved Ones which the All-Bestowing hath revealed and sent unto thee, that thou mayest read it and share it with those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness. By the life of the Beloved! Nothing that hath been created in earth and heaven can compare with it. To this beareth witness the Lord of Names, Who is established upon the throne in this noble station. While I was engaged in writing this leaf, the Beloved of the world summoned me and said, exalted be His grandeur and mighty be His utterance.\n\nWrite to his honor 'Andalib: O 'Andalib! Fix your gaze upon this decisive, firm and comprehensive blessed Word which hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of God's Book, and counsel all therewith, that perchance they may know with perfect certitude that the triumph of God's Cause hath not been and is not through the sword, contention, strife and corruption. And that blessed Word which hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book is this: \"We have lifted the law of the sword and have established in its place the law of expression. Well is it with them who possess understanding and who have held fast unto that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book.\" Despite this decisive and firm Word, it is observed that some still remain in doubt and misgiving, and through their personal delusions are engaged in interpreting the word of victory. Say: What aileth you that ye comprehend not and perceive not? Verily have We counseled all to show kindness, compassion and care. Well is it with him who hath attained unto My purpose, and woe unto the heedless. It would seem they place their own will before the Will of God, or regard what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance as jest, or God forbid, see the Truth as powerless and weak. Say: Woe unto you! Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful. Verily He is the Mighty, the Supreme. Verily He is the Victorious, the All-Wise. Verily He is the Subduer over His creation and He is the All-Knowing. Therefore beseech God that He may confirm His loved ones in goodly deeds and pleasing conduct, and in that which the Book of God, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath decreed.\n\nToday is a different day and a different heaven is upraised and a different sea is surging. It cannot and will not be compared with before and after. Say: Today the sun of bounty is manifest and the ocean of grace is before all faces. Move in this spiritual atmosphere with the wings of spirit, and keep yourselves detached, free and sanctified from the impurities, allusions and dust of the vicissitudes of time. Wings soiled with mud are not worthy of flight nor capable of ascension. O 'Andalib! Say: Today an illumined heart is needed, an expanded breast and penetrating vision. Perchance ye may leave behind what ye have heard and relate what ye behold. Man needeth human qualities. Alas! Alas! Words cannot bear these meanings and the pen findeth itself powerless to translate. The Command is in the hand of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Praise be unto Him! Verily He speaketh the truth and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nO 'Andalib! That which thou didst send through the servant who was present and his honor Ism-i-Jud, upon both of them be My glory, from the epistles was presented at the Most Holy Court. Through pure grace, sublime and exalted verses were revealed and sent specially for all the souls mentioned therein, both living and dead. God willing, they shall attain unto them. The mention of God is life for the dead and a bounty for the loved ones. Know thou the value of this favor and speak forth in praise and thanksgiving to God. Blessed be thy tongue for what it hath sung, and thy heart for what it hath composed, and thy thought for the virgin meanings of recognition that have appeared from it in praise of God, the Lord of proof and evidence.\n\nDivine favor is manifest and evident upon that beloved one and those true friends. God willing, may all attain to that which is beloved in His presence. That honored one who, praise be to God, has in these divine days succeeded in offering praise unto the Truth - the entire world has been and remains incapable of adequately thanking Him for this supreme bounty. God willing, may you set ablaze the souls in those lands with the fire of divine love. A word that issues forth from a detached heart has been and ever shall be effective. This is what I have heard from the mouth of my Lord's will, the Perspicuous, the Wise. Convey greetings and make mention to all on behalf of this evanescent servant. O friends! Today is a momentous day. Strive to deposit enduring traces in this perishable ruin. While time remains, we must all count it as precious and occupy ourselves with that which is befitting and worthy. What is lost today, when shall it be recovered and who shall recover it? At this moment it behooveth this servant to call upon the Lord of the mystics and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and earth, saying:\n\nO God of the world and Goal of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Name through which the gate of Thy most exalted Paradise was opened to all who are in the kingdom of creation, and through which the Call was raised between earth and heaven, to assist Thy chosen ones to celebrate Thy praise and glorification, and inspire them with that which Thou hast willed through Thy knowledge. O Lord! Deprive them not of the ocean of Thy good-pleasure, nor keep them distant from the sanctuaries of Thy nearness. O Lord! Regard them not according to what they possess, but behold the heaven of Thy bounty and riches, and the helplessness of Thy creation and the poverty of Thy servants. Thou art the One before Whose manifestation and appearance the kingdom of power bowed low. There is no God but Thee, the Giving, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous. Glory be upon you and upon those who were attracted by the sweetness of the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and upon every one who turned unto God when He came with manifest sovereignty. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n23 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1298\n\n=== END BH00867 ===\n\n=== START BH00868 ===\n\nIn the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord\n\nToday, praise and salutation, remembrance and utterance belong especially to the friends of God, exalted be His glory, whom the doubts of the people of the world did not prevent from the path of the All-Merciful. They caught the fragrance of His garment and hastened to the court of the Friend. The prevention of hinderers, the might of oppressors, the schemes of plotters, the turning away of the divines, and the closing of eyes by the jurisprudents did not keep them from the lights of the countenance of the Lord of Names. From the chalices of recognition they drank the wine of salvation in the name of Him Who controls the winds - a draught that made them independent and free from need of the rivers and streams of the world. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and earth, these are the souls mentioned in the books of the past and future. Exalted is He Who strengthened them, caused them to recognize, revealed them, and established them in the service of His Cause. They are the breakers of the idols of vain imaginings and the confounders of the enemies of the Lord of all beings. The servant begs his Lord to strengthen them, assist them, and grant them the best of what lies with Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Sender of rains and Causer of rivers to flow! I beseech Thee by the gems of Thy creation who have fulfilled Thy covenant and Thy testament, to assist Thy loved ones to achieve such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginings, nor prevented by the princes of men. O Lord! Thou seest the people of the Bayan and hearest what their tongues utter, and knowest their deeds and their turning away from the Station whereby Thy proof was established from time immemorial and the signs of Thy power were revealed with majesty and grandeur. I beseech Thee, O Subduer of the world and Quickener of moldering bones, to assist them to return. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then make, O my God and my Goal, Thy servant Khalil among those who aid Thy Cause and who speak Thy praise. O Lord! Assist him in all circumstances. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Most High.\n\nThereafter, thy letter which was perfumed with the remembrance and praise of the Beloved of the worlds was as collyrium to the eye and manifest joy to the heart. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist thee in that which is befitting. After its reading and perusal, it was taken to the Most Exalted Station and presented before His presence and was honored to be heard. This is what was sent down from the kingdom of the wisdom of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing\n\nO Khalil! The peoples of the world are seen as children. Let none wonder at this exalted word, for all are occupied with matters which they themselves witness shall perish and pass away, and with their own hands they kindle that which they shall be powerless to extinguish. Vain imaginings have seized them all, and false suppositions have kept them back from that which would profit them, save those whom God has willed. None draws a breath for the sake of God, nor takes a step for His cause. They appear as sheep that have lost their shepherd, scattered and distracted, wandering in the wilderness of heedlessness and ignorance, and are unaware. Beseech ye God, exalted be His glory, to vouchsafe unto His servants a drop from the ocean of knowledge and to bestow His bounty upon them. He is the Bestower, the All-Powerful.\n\nReflect upon the people of the Bayan: although they witnessed the Shi'ih sect and the fruits of their deeds, as ye have seen with your own eyes and heard with your own ears, yet they have again clung to the same vain imaginings. Through fancy they are deprived of the Sovereign of certitude, and through a mere pond they are kept back from the Most Great Ocean.\n\nSay: O God, my Worshipped One, my Adored One! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy ancient and recent bounties. Thou art the Generous One Who hath caused the rain-clouds of Thy mercy to shower upon the high and the lowly alike, and the splendors of the Sun of Thy grace to shine upon both the obedient and the rebellious. O Merciful One, before Whose gate the essence of mercy boweth down, and around Whose Cause the reality of bounty circleth! I beseech Thee and seek Thy ancient grace and seek Thy recent generosity, that Thou mayest have mercy upon the manifestations of existence and deprive them not of the outpourings of Thy days. All are needy and poor, and Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.\n\nPraise and glory be unto God! The ocean of utterance is so tempestuous that this evanescent servant is incapable of mentioning or describing it. The non-existent hath no station or expression before the presence of Him Who is the Ever-Existing. With the utmost powerlessness and contrition, I cling to the hem of the robe of His grace, that He may assist that honored one in all conditions and deprive not His servants of the bounties of His days. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.\n\nConcerning what was written about Aqa Mirza 'Ali, brother of Aqa Mirza Muhammad Khan, upon them both be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], their letter was received and presented before the Countenance of the Beloved of the worlds. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet in the mode of verses, and one Most Wondrous, Most Sweet Tablet in Persian were revealed from the heaven of grace and bounty; these have been written and sent. I beseech God to enable them to attain His presence that they may drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful that which will cause movement and be the cause of enkindlement, and that they may arise to serve the Cause, that is, to teach. This servant conveys greetings to them and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for such confirmation as its effects may become manifest and evident throughout all regions. He is the Bestower Whom the veils of the world and the clouds of the nations have not and shall not hinder. Ever hath the hand of His power been manifest and the eye of His bounty extended. Blessed are they who, at this dayspring, have not deprived themselves of the effulgences of the Sun of grace. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bestower, the Generous, and He is the Bountiful, the Gracious. There is no God but Him, the Exalted, the Great.\n\nConcerning the mention of the honored ones: his honor Aqa Mirza Mahmud, his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad Khan, and his honor Aqa Muhammad Hasan Khan, upon them be the Glory of God - all are remembered in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. Praise be to God that after their names were presented, there descended from the heaven of grace that which its fragrance shall endure through the duration of His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes. This servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, that He may cause each one to be raised up like a standard of His Cause, manifest and resplendent. He is the Fulfiller of the needs of all who ask and He is the Hope of all who hope and the Goal of all who seek. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those whom vain imaginings have not kept back from God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00868 ===\n\n=== START BH00869 ===\n\nO Abdul-Ghani! Hearken unto the call of the All-Bountiful in the most wondrous and sweet language. This is the Day wherein every soul, detached from all else, must occupy itself with the remembrance of the Sovereign Lord of verses. Look not at what hath been mentioned, but at what hath shone forth from this Horizon, from which the Sun of Glory and Power hath dawned.\n\nArise with the utmost diligence and endeavor to promote the Cause. Soon shall the people of truth behold in the Kingdom the fruits of acceptance and deeds. This is the Day of helplessness and supplication. Pure nothingness hath been and shall ever be beloved, and whosoever attaineth unto this station shall be reckoned before God among the dwellers of the cities of eternity.\n\nMany are those who have remained deprived and forbidden from a single word of the Sovereign of Oneness. The Tablets sent down from the heaven of God's Will have been revealed concerning every matter. No mention remaineth except that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and no question is seen except that its answer hath dawned and appeared from the horizon of the heaven of inner meanings.\n\nAlthough much of what was revealed hath been lost and effaced due to lack of time and the rebellion of the people of hatred, strive to obtain that which exists, that thou mayest testify with complete certitude that all that hath been and will be mentioned hath flowed from the Ancient Pen.\n\nAs to thy question about the Mathnavi poetry, it would be a pity in this Day for the Most Exalted Pen to flow in such mentions. Hast thou not observed that the Primal Point, the Most Exalted Remembrance, saith \"His mention shall be 'There is none other God but I, O My creation, bear ye witness unto Me'\"? Nevertheless, in previous years there hath flowed from the Ancient Pen in these stations that which sufficeth.\n\nSimilarly, questions were asked about the disconnected letters. During the sojourn of the Day Star of the horizons in Iraq, countless verses were revealed concerning these matters, some of which were sent. By My life! If thou wert to look with penetrating vision, thou wouldst find therein that which would make thee soar in the atmosphere of wisdom and utterance. Reflect upon those revealed verses, for We have deposited in the depths of those allusions the mysteries of thy Lord, the Source of verses. Oceans of meanings lie concealed therein, and divine consummate wisdom is hidden therein. Blessed is he who recognizeth and saith: \"I testify, O my God, that Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nLikewise, previously some explanations flowed from the Pen of Command concerning a single verse of the Mathnavi and were sent. In truth, the meanings of what thou hast asked and what thou hast not asked are all concealed and inscribed therein.\n\nFurthermore, concerning the blessed verse \"Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated,\" thou hadst inquired. In this regard, a mention of the Sovereign was previously revealed. Search that thou mayest find and be of them who know. However, We have commanded the Most Great Branch to interpret anew that blessed verse and send it.\n\nMoreover, mention was made of the Dawning-Places of Manifestations and the Rising-Points of divine verses, especially in Tablets concerning the mention of Names, their essences, their effulgences, their realities, their origins, their influences, their ascents and their descents, revealed from the Source of Command in response to one of the loved ones in the Land of Mystery. Blessed is he who findeth and readeth and saith: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds.\"\n\nIn the Epistle of Badi', which was sent down from the heaven of Will in the name of one of the servants, reflect thou upon the unveiling of certain veiled matters therein.\n\nO illumined one! A Tablet from God, the Lord of creation, hath been sent unto thee. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions and to make thee among those who have attained to what He desired for them in the beginning and the end. If God should will and desire it, divine Tablets shall reach thee hereafter, and thou shalt attain unto them.\n\nMake mention on My behalf of Our servant who is named Majid. Say: Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Qiblih of all horizons. Happy art thou and happy is he who hath drunk the cup of life from the fingers of the mercy of his Lord, the All-Merciful, on this Day which God hath made the solace of all days. Grieve not over remoteness, for how many a remote one have We decreed to be near, and how many a near one is verily in the fire. Be as thy Lord desireth thee to be. He desireth for those who turn unto Him naught save what He hath desired for His chosen servants. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as mention of thee hath flowed from the Most Great Pen and thy name hath been uttered by the tongue of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving.\n\nThen make mention of the Hearing One. Say: Hearken unto that which the Lord of Destiny calleth thee from the direction of His most great prospect.\n\nThen make mention of the Bearer of Glad Tidings. Say: By God! The moon hath been cleft asunder and the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Blessed be the ear that hath heard the call of its Lord and hath said: \"Yea, O Beloved of the heavens and the earth!\" Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Qiblih of them that have recognized Him, and for having mentioned Him with thy tongue while He was imprisoned in this mighty prison. This prison hath been named the Most Great Prison. Ponder upon this, that ye may comprehend what your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath intended. Before this, We were beneath chains and fetters when We were in the prison of the wicked in the land of ?a, yet that was not named the Most Great. Thus doth the Lord of nations inform thee that thou mayest be among the discerning ones.\n\nThen make mention of him who was named by the Most Great Name. Say: Give thanks unto thy Lord for having aided thee to recognize His Self on this Day whereon earthquakes have seized all the tribes of the earth and the veils of idle fancy have been rent asunder through this Name whereby the standards of thy Lord's Cause, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, have been raised aloft and that which was hidden hath been revealed. Render thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn unto the horizon of Beauty and for having bestowed upon thee that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His name, the Self-Subsisting. Put thy trust in Him in all matters. Say: Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of the seen and the unseen! Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of thy Lord after all the polytheists rejected Him. Adorn thy breast with the ornament of divine knowledge, thy heart with the remembrance of the All-Merciful, and thy tongue with His Name, the One Who overlordeth all that witnesseth and is witnessed. Rejoice in what hath been sent down unto thee from the direction of the Throne - manifest verses which nothing in the heavens or earth can equal. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO My loved ones! Grieve not over anything. Put your trust in God. By My life! He hath ordained for you that which shall never perish. He is the Mighty, the All-Loving. O thou who art rich! God willing, thou hast been and wilt ever be the recipient of the effulgent favors shining from the Dayspring of Beauty, and with utmost joy and fragrance thou art occupied in helping the Cause of the All-Merciful through gracious utterances and penetrating counsels. This is the most great bounty and the most ancient grace. In all divine words, diligent effort is necessary. Acquire what thou canst and occupy thyself therewith. Thou art accounted among the people of Baha by the Most Exalted Pen. This bounty sufficeth thee - be thou grateful and among the thankful ones. All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and give them the glad tidings of the mention of their Lord, the All-Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00869 ===\n\n=== START BH00870 ===\n\nHe is the Healer, the Sufficer, the Helper, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nI call on Thee O Exalted One, O Faithful One, O Glorious One!

When I had read and learned of its contents, I brought thy letter before the Most Great Book through which all the books of what was and what shall be were expounded, and I stood before the Throne and presented what thou didst desire of our Lord, the Omnipotent, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient. When my supplications were completed, He commanded me with this conclusive address, His word - exalted and mighty be He:\n\nO My servant! Take up the Pen and write unto Our great servant that which shall quicken every mouldering bone. Verily the breezes of the Most Exalted Pen on this blessed and most glorious Day have been the source of life for all created things, the bestower of existence unto all who dwell in the unseen and the visible realms, and the dispenser of the wine of immortality unto all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO 'Azim! Hearken in the Persian tongue unto the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, that thou mayest attain in manifest clarity unto that which is intended. Concerning what thou didst mention regarding the commission of deeds that are not pleasing, blessed art thou for having confessed before the Throne, and He hath, through His grace, absolved thee of thy misdeeds. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. This year, when the fragrance of thy love wafted by, a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent forth from the Dayspring of divine verses before thy petition and mention. Therefore render thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou with Whom lieth the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.\n\nFurthermore, be it known that in this Day whosoever committeth that which causeth souls to be debarred from the sweet-flowing waters of divine knowledge shall be rejected and shall remain rejected. The Cause of God is sanctified above carnal desires and deeds that are not pleasing. All must arise to serve the Cause of God with complete sanctity and detachment, that all people may become aware through the character, deeds, actions and words of these devoted souls, and, awakening from the slumber of heedlessness, may turn toward the sanctuary of oneness. Say: By God! The wine mentioned in the Qur'an is My love, and the Kawthar is My remembrance, and the milk is that which is concealed within My words, and the honey is My sweetest utterance, the mighty, the inaccessible. Say: O people of vain desires! That wine increaseth heedlessness, while this wine bestoweth life everlasting. Which then is more excellent? The latter, by the Lord of the oft-repeated verses and this perspicuous Book! Had the people acted in accordance with Our commandments, assuredly most of the inhabitants of the cities would now be witnessed having attained unto the recognition of the All-Merciful.\n\nIn any case, thou must arise to serve the Cause of God with utmost sanctity and strive diligently, to the extent of thy capacity, to promote His Cause with the wisdom revealed in the Books. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this Tablet after what was revealed before. Therefore give thanks and be of those who are grateful.\n\nAs for the negligence and laxity shown in serving him who ascended unto God, We have pardoned this. Grieve not therefore, for thy Lord is verily the Omnipotent, the Almighty. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty. None can stay His command and none can avert His judgment. He is in truth the All-Compelling, the Omnipotent over all the worlds. However, know thou that this matter was among the gravest of transgressions, for the good-pleasure of parents is mentioned as a weighty matter in the Book of God, especially regarding the one who hath hastened unto the Most Glorious Horizon and attained unto the Supreme Companion. Therefore render thanks that the All-Informed Lord hath forgiven this grievous sin. Give thanks for this and be of those who rejoice.\n\nConcerning the mention of Our Name, the Luminous, upon him be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, thou hast made mention. We have forgiven thee what thou didst before and after. Avoid that which thou hast been forbidden in the Book of God. This is the command of God, before and after. Blessed are they that act.\n\nAnd concerning what thou hast submitted about thy claim from the aforementioned souls, forgive them as We have forgiven thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Compassionate. It hath been clear and evident to everyone that most of the people of the Bayan were not cognizant of the divine commandments and followed their selfish desires until, through divine grace and infinite bounty, they became somewhat aware of the divine laws in this Most Great Revelation. Henceforth must all appear in complete sanctity and purity, and not soil the illumined and pure hem of trustworthiness with the dust of treachery.\n\nO 'Azim! If the servants would observe with pure and penetrating eyes and illumined and sincere hearts the evanescence of things and their transformation and variation, they would assuredly sacrifice their lives and property in the path of God. They would pay no attention whatsoever to the riches of the world, let alone the property of others. Trustworthiness among deeds is as sight in the human temple and as the sun amidst the stars of heaven. The comfort and tranquility of the servants and the glory and wealth of those in the land have depended upon trustworthiness. God willing, all must hold fast unto it and appear among the people with this supreme gift and mighty bounty. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto, and alas and regret for the treacherous ones!\n\nThe basest and most rejected of souls in the sight of God have been and will be the treacherous ones. He who betrayeth shall be betrayed and shall find no blessing even if all the wealth of the world should gather unto him. God will make it the portion of another. Thy Lord knoweth, while those who are heedless know not. Ere long it shall be witnessed that thereafter the servants shall be adorned among the people with the crown of trustworthiness and the ornament of justice. These are the stars of the heaven of detachment, and through them shall the lost ones be guided. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nThat honorable one should not grieve over what is past and perished. God will verily compensate thee in truth. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Munificent, the Generous. All have been commanded to occupy themselves with some affair; therefore that honorable one should engage in some occupation, and blessings shall descend from the heaven of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Enriching, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about not mentioning the treachery of those souls to strangers - this matter was most acceptable. Blessed art thou for having concealed and preserved, for in these days if someone commits a deplorable act and people become aware of it, they attribute it to the Cause itself. That honorable one hath truly preserved the beauty of the Cause. Thy reward is with God Who created thee, fashioned thee, and guided thee to this straight path. Verily, he in whose heart is My love is indeed independent of the worlds, for he possesseth the Most Great Treasure, the Supreme Store, and Absolute Wealth. Thus have We expounded for thee in detail that thou mayest thank thy Lord and be of those who are firm.\n\nConvey to all the friends of God who dwell in that land, one and all, young and old, male and female, from this evanescent servant, infinite greetings and the Most Glorious, Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Beauteous mention. The Glory be upon you all.\n\nThe evanescent servant, the servant\n\n=== END BH00871 ===\n\n=== START BH00872 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nA Tablet from Our presence and a Book from before Us to him who turned his face to the Qiblih of existence and traversed land and sea until he entered the Most Exalted Paradise--the station wherein the Sadratu'l-Muntaha proclaimed that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe bear witness that thou didst enter the prison, and present thyself, and stand before the gate, and with thine own ears didst hear the call of the Wronged One--a call through which every lamp was lit, every sun rose, every moon appeared, and every luminous horizon shone forth. Blessed be thy father who detached himself from the world and all that is therein, and turned wholly unto God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, until he attained the presence of the Throne and God shone upon him with the lights of His countenance. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Informed, the All-Knowing.\n\nWe sheltered him beneath the shade of the Tree of Our mercy for numbered months until his time was fulfilled. We commanded him to return, and he returned by the command of his Lord, until he reached the place wherein he ascended unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus did We inform him aforetime through My Most Exalted Pen. Verily, the knowledge of thy Lord encompasseth the heavens and the earth, yet most of the people are heedless. We revealed for him, before and after his ascension, that whereby his remembrance shall endure throughout the duration of My mighty Kingdom. Be thou grateful to God for this, and We, at this hour, give thanks through his tongue. Verily, thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.\n\nThou wert indeed in the vicinity of thy Lord's mercy and attained the presence of the Throne time and again. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. When the appointed time came, We commanded thee to return that thou mightest remind the people of God's Message and gladden them with this Remembrance--at Whose proclamation the sea cried out: \"There is none other God but Him,\" and the land declared: \"He is the Truth, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy.\" At His call all things cried out, and every seeing one turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, every hearing one to His sweetest utterance, and every assured one to His straight Path. Thus hath the Most Great Ocean overflowed, that thou mayest rejoice in thy Lord's bounty and be of them that have attained.\n\nPraise be to God that through divine bounty thou hast been assisted and hast turned toward His direction, until thou didst enter the Most Great Prison and didst hearken with thine outer and inner ears to the call of the Wronged One of the horizons. Thou didst drink from the hands of bounty the Kawthar of meeting, which had been the hope of those near and sincere ones. It behooveth thee to praise and thank God throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm. God willing, thou shouldst occupy thyself with service to the Cause, which is teaching - meaning that thou shouldst guide those who wander in the wilderness of heedlessness to the ocean of divine knowledge and wisdom, through the blessing of the Most Great Name. Say: O friends! Today ye must all be so enkindled with the heat of the love of God that its warmth may be evident from all your veins, limbs and members, that all the peoples of the world may be ignited by this heat and turn toward the horizon of their goal. We counsel all to act according to what We have revealed in the Book. All must adorn themselves with divine virtues and act upon that which will cause the exaltation of God's Cause and the glorification of souls. Blessed is the land over which the breeze of God hath wafted and which hath perceived the fragrance of God. O people of Baha! Know ye the value of these days and arise to perform deeds worthy and befitting this Day. Each one of you must appear in such wise that people may inhale from him the sweet savors of the Merciful and discover the attributes of God. If what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen had truly been heeded, no withered and dead one would now be seen in the land. The greatness of this day is such that the Spirit speaketh, saying: \"Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to attain unto Thy presence,\" and He Who conversed with God uttereth: \"Thanks be to Thee, O my God, for having shown me Thy Beauty and for having shed upon me the light of Thy countenance.\" By God's life! The Beloved crieth out, saying: \"Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink the cup of Thy reunion and for having shown me the horizon of Thy manifestation and granted me true knowledge of Thee.\" And the Desired One speaketh, saying: \"Praise be to Thee, O Goal of the Bayan, for having revealed Thy countenance and made Thyself known to Thy servants, and glory be to Thee for having rent asunder the veils in the ninth year and manifested Thyself in the eightieth, though the followers of the Bayan protested.\" O people of Baha! I swear by the ocean of meanings that from every word floweth the stream of life - do ye drink and remain unmoved, or are ye unaware? Today all atoms proclaim \"The Sovereign hath come!\" and all the Concourse on High give glad tidings to the people of creation that \"Thy Lord hath come, and on that day sovereignty belongeth unto God.\" Are ears deprived of hearing these spiritual melodies, or are they prevented by outward means? Hear ye the call of the Wronged One and let not time slip away. Make your utmost effort lest ye be deprived of the outpourings of the Day of God. And summon all to the Most Great Steadfastness, that perchance they may not lose this mighty gift and may preserve it through the Name of Truth. Thou hast observed that although in most Tablets We counseled the friends to this lofty and most exalted station, which is the station of steadfastness, yet someone was deprived of the ocean of grace and barred from the heaven of bounty by mere trifles. Woe upon him and upon those who followed him.\n\nToday, those who have drunk from this ocean must behold themselves in such a station that all who are on earth would be powerless to speak in refutation of them, let alone cause them to go astray. Share in gatherings those utterances which thou didst hear from the Primal Point in His presence, that perchance they may recognize the station which most of the servants have failed to perceive. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Teacher. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy father and thy mother and thy brother and those who have believed in the Peerless, the All-Knowing.\n\nSay: Glory be unto Thee, O God of Might and King of the Kingdom and He Who rules over all who are in the heavens and on earth! I testify that Thou didst aid me and enable me to attain unto the presence before the gate of Thy bounty and to hear Thy sweetest call and to witness the effulgences of the lights of Thy most exalted Throne, whereby the earth and heaven were illumined. By Thy might, O King of Kings! Were I to praise Thee throughout the duration of Thy names and attributes, it would not befit Thy presence nor would it equal what Thou hast bestowed upon me through Thy generosity and favor. I beseech Thee, O Cleaver of the Dawn and Subduer of the Winds, to assist me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that I may mention Thee among Thy servants through what Thou hast taught me in Thy Sacred Books and Tablets. O my Lord! Withhold me not from the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy grace. Remember me through Thy favor in the Concourse on High, even as Thou didst remember Thy servants who cast away all else save Thee and turned toward Thy luminous countenance. O my God! I beseech Thee to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art the Doer of what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\n=== END BH00872 ===\n\n=== START BH00873 ===\n\nIn the Name of the Peerless, Incomparable God!\n\nYour letter addressed to this servant, present before the Throne, was received before the Divine Presence. Previously, a detailed Tablet was written and sent to you, and likewise to Ali and Anis, upon them be the glory of God. God willing, may all else be awakened by the fragrances of your love and the wondrous expressions of your remembrance, and may they incline their hearts toward the Beloved, Who is sanctified above all directions. The letter which the Afnan had written to you was also presented and observed before the Most Great Presence, and from it was inhaled the fragrance of the love of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he, and glory be unto him from his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nIn his letter mention was made of two of the Afnan; therefore the ocean of thy Lord's loving-kindness surged, and the winds of thy Master's favors were stirred, and there was revealed for each of them a Tablet that brought solace to the eyes. In the Land of Mystery and Iraq it was revealed in Tablets that all the Afnan would attain unto the Everlasting Law. Thus did God will it, and His will hath been and ever shall be sovereign and all-encompassing. The gaze of mercy and the glance of bounty have ever been directed towards them and, God willing, ever shall be. Had all who dwell on earth been mentioned in His Book, We would have revealed for them that which would cause spirits to soar and minds to be attracted. This is of Our grace upon him. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Forgiving.\n\nWe beseech God that all may remain steadfast and firm in His love, in such wise that the fragrances of their constancy may waft throughout the realm. This is a station concerning which the Beloved of the world made complaint--though in truth it was not a complaint, but rather a revelation of the greatness of this station. He said, and His word is the truth: \"These two verses have turned My hair white.\"\n\nO My Name! The utmost joy and delight were occasioned by the turning of those two souls whose mention was outwardly made in the Most Holy Court, for God hath never wished that any of those souls should remain veiled. Say: Take ye the chalices of salvation in the name of Him Who causeth the dawn to break, then drink therefrom in remembrance of this Light on this morn. Well is it with you, O ye that drink!\n\nO My Name! The fragrances of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness are wafting with the utmost joy and fragrance throughout all creation, and the utterance of the Beloved is manifest with supreme delicacy and sweetness. The Pen of the Lord of eternity floweth with perfect clarity and sweetness. Nevertheless, behold how many of the people remain veiled and remote. Hath any melody equaled this melody? Nay, by the Lord of all created things! Hath any call more exalted or more sweet reached mortal ears? Nay, by My all-compelling Self!\n\nO Mahdi! At a time when the Manifest Beauty was imprisoned at the hands of the oppressors of the earth, and both those without and those within were engaged in the utmost heedlessness and error, tyranny and insolence, the call was that which thou didst hear, and the Tablets were those that were sent to the rulers of the earth. Have I ever compromised in the Cause of God? Then would the Lord of Lords declare: Nay, by thy life, O thou through whom sovereignty and power have been manifested!\n\nO Mahdi! Nevertheless, some of the veiled ones among the people of the Bayan have preferred and chosen the buzzing of flies over the wondrous melodies of the Lord of Names and Attributes. This is indeed oppression, wert thou to perceive it. They have abandoned the most pure and fragrant Kawthar and turned to the putrid and noxious pool.\n\nO Mahdi! The exposition is vast and time is short; therefore it is better that we turn to mention other matters.\n\nFurthermore, in the letter from Afnan was mentioned his brother and sister who had intended to journey to the Most Holy Court. How excellent was their intention! However, this land continues to be in turmoil, as was previously detailed in the Tablets. The manifestation of turmoil is in these days, therefore permission was not granted on this occasion. O My Name! We perceive from Muhammad, in most times, the fragrance of love for his Lord, the All-Merciful. Think not that thy Lord is heedless. With Him is the knowledge of all things, but the people are in heedlessness and behind a veil. We make mention of him at times, as testified by Him Who has knowledge of mysteries. Convey My greetings unto him and unto the sister. For them is a goodly return.\n\nIn his letter was mention of the Trustworthy One. We beseech God to strengthen him at all times. Verily, He is the Answerer of the prayers of the supplicants. May He enable him to do what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Ruler over what He wishes. Say unto him: We have known what thou hast done in the path of thy Lord. We were with thee in all conditions. We testify and We see.\n\nLikewise, the letter of Ibn-i-Za', upon him be the Glory of God, which he had written to thee, was presented before the Face. Convey My greetings unto his face. We beseech God to strengthen him in the service of his Lord. We testify that he is among those who have attained and witnessed the testimony of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is better for him than what is witnessed and seen. Verily thy Lord is the Munificent Giver. He makes mention of Us in the letter Ha; We make mention of him in this Great Prison. Say: Say: My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy favors, O Beloved of the worlds!\n\nFurthermore, regarding the aforementioned sum that the honored Afnan had mentioned - verily he is the trustee from the presence of the Truth. This was decreed aforetime from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. We had previously given permission that whatever amount your honor needs for occupation may be requested. Now the decree remains the same, however major commerce in that land is not permitted for your honor. Let it be just enough to keep you occupied and to expend, for enemies seek to grasp at various pretexts and arise in pursuit. This apparent wisdom is mentioned, otherwise thy Lord is verily the Protector in all conditions. Verily, He has power over all things. We have previously commanded the observance of outward matters, therefore the Pen flows upon such matters.\n\nLikewise, a special Tablet for the honored Uncle, upon him be the Glory of God, was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, and was sent. O My Name! Convey sublime greetings from this Prisoner to all the loved ones of that land and other regions. The poems of his honor 'Ali were mentioned before the Face. Blessed is he in having drunk the wine of faith and having opened his lips in praise of his Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nSay to Isma'il: We had previously answered thee, as if thou hast forgotten it. Be thou assured and trust in God. He will give thee what He willeth. He is verily the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nSay: O Moses! We beseech God to cause thee to hear from this Tree what the Interlocutor heard. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. O My Name! Convey what We have conveyed to thee in this Tablet, then send what was revealed for thee before, and be of those who remember. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who have remained steadfast in the Cause and were among the firm ones.\n\n=== END BH00873 ===\n\n=== START BH00874 ===\n\nIn His Name, the All-Compelling Lord of the heavens and earth!\n\nThis is an epistle from the Wronged One, Who was named Husayn before ?Ali, unto thee, that it may draw thee nigh unto God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Be not of those who clung to learning when there came unto them the All-Knowing One from God, the Mighty, the Loving. Rend asunder the greatest veil by God's leave, the Lord of destiny, then turn thy face toward the Most Pure Horizon. This is better for thee than all the learning thou dost possess. Cast aside vain imaginings. By God! The morn of faith hath dawned through the light of certitude. Blessed be the All-Merciful Who created man and made him the repository of His hidden knowledge. Is there any doubt about His power which hath encompassed all horizons? Or concerning His sovereignty? Vain indeed are their imaginings.\n\nWe impart unto thee a word that perchance thereby the slumberers may be awakened. Behold and call to mind when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz: the divines opposed Him while those who tended sheep believed in Him. Thus doth this imprisoned Youth remind thee. Then consider when the Spirit came: the Pharisees among the scholars of the Torah opposed Him, while those who caught fish believed in Him. Shouldst thou ponder that which We have imparted unto thee purely for thy Lord's sake, God will surely open before thy heart's face the gate of true knowledge, and the breaths of utterance will so attract thee that thou wilt become detached from all possibility, turning unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Cast aside doubts, for the rose of certitude hath smiled in the garden of revelation and witnessing.\n\nIn the Persian tongue We make utterance, that perchance through the favors of the Lord of Lords thou mayest not, in this most perfect of all seasons of possibility, be deprived of the outpourings of the All-Merciful. The world hath never had, nor hath it now, any worth. This is what hath passed away, and this is what remaineth. Seize ye the opportunity, O people of insight and understanding! In view of the promotion of God's Cause and the former friendship, it was necessary that a mention be made unto thee concerning that which God hath willed, that perchance through the assistance of the King of Oneness, the seed of remembrance may find its place in thy heart, and from the rain of the All-Merciful's mercy, which in these spiritual days poureth down from the clouds of divine bounty, there may spring forth from that seed the ears of divine knowledge and wisdom. This is not difficult for God.\n\nEver have the vain imaginings and idle fancies of men kept them from the All-Glorious Truth. Let your honor ponder the times of the manifestation of the Divine Luminaries. Although in every age mankind has sought perfection and waited day and night, yet when the hour came, most turned away and remained deprived of the waters of divine grace. Consider the days of the Manifestation of the Apostle of God. After that Sun of Truth rose from the horizon of Hijaz, how many were the people of fancy who afflicted that divine Tree with the stones of denial and objection. In the early years, the Jewish and Christian divines strove with utmost diligence to extinguish the light of that resplendent Luminary. Through their turning away, all people, both high and low, turned away as well. Some of these divines lived in complete detachment and seclusion, dwelling in temples in the name of God and abstaining from all worldly pleasures. Nevertheless, they remained debarred from the glorious Truth and distant from the stations of nearness. Reflect upon this, that perchance the veils of idle fancy may be rent asunder by the hand of certitude, and you may attain to the manifest light which is the recognition of the Manifestation of the Lord of all worlds.\n\nLikewise consider the appearance of Jesus, son of Mary. All the Pharisees among the Jewish clergy denounced that King of existence, and Annas, who was the most learned divine of that age, pronounced the death sentence against Him. Yet Peter, known as Simon, who was but a fisherman on the shores of the sea and had not learned a word of the outward sciences, accepted and believed in Him upon hearing but a single word from that Manifestation of the Divine Cause. Such is God's grace - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth.\n\nThe purpose of these words is that your honor should not heed the denial and objection of the people, whether learned or ignorant. Look to the essence of the Cause, that you may attain the Most Sublime Vision. For the turning away of people has never been and will never be of consequence. O ye who thirst in the desert of separation, deprive not yourselves of the surging ocean of attainment. The Sun of Recognition has risen from the horizon of the mercy of the All-Merciful - deny not yourselves its effulgent rays. Should your honor reflect upon the Cause of this servant, it would suffice. For you yourself bear witness that this servant has not acquired the outward sciences nor attended any school. Yet the waters of divine knowledge and wisdom flow from his tongue and pen in such measure that all creation is powerless to comprehend or enumerate them. This is mentioned not to display station, but in light of the blessed verse which says \"But as for thy Lord's favour, proclaim it!\" - that perchance a stranger might turn to his true home, the station to which all must return, or that decayed bones might attain eternal life through the breaths of divine utterances.\n\nO Abbas! We have summoned thee unto God, the Lord of all names, whilst We lay imprisoned beneath the swords of the enemy. Thus was the decree ordained. No affliction deterreth Us from making mention of God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him in these days wherein eyes are intoxicated save those who have laid fast hold on the Sure Handle and have turned toward His Countenance with humility and contrition. We beseech God to aid thee to know the Manifestation of His Self, and to draw thee nigh unto the Dayspring of revelation and inspiration. Count ye these days as precious; that which escapeth a soul today cannot be regained even in a hundred years. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. When thou hearest the call of the Herald, turn thy face toward God, the Lord of creation. Say:\n\nO my Lord! I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy lovers which was shed in Thy path, and by the cry of the yearning ones which was raised in their separation from Thee, and by Him Who hath borne tribulations in His love for Thee until He was imprisoned in the most desolate of lands through what the hands of the heedless among Thy creatures have wrought - not to render me deprived of the breezes of these days wherein Thou hast manifested Thyself through Thy Most Great Name unto all nations. Then cause me, O my God, to be a servant of Thy Cause and a champion of Thy Faith in such wise that neither the oppression of the oppressors may hold me back from Thy remembrance and praise, nor the turning away of the heedless from directing myself toward the horizon of Thy Cause and Thy favors. O Lord! I am weak and Thou art the Strong One; I am poor and Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most High. O my God! I am one who hath cast away idle fancy and taken hold of what Thou hast commanded me, O Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven. I beseech Thee to make me turn wholly unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Verily Thou art the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00874 ===\n\n=== START BH00875 ===\n\nO Samandar, upon him be the Most Wondrous, Most Glorious Splendor of God! This is a Book from the Self-Subsisting to people who know. Are they who turned away based on anything? Nay, by thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting! Are they who denied among the people of witness asleep? Yea, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving! They say \"We were promised in the Tablets,\" yet when the Promised One came, they denied the Witness and the Witnessed. When told \"The verses have been revealed,\" they say \"Are they according to the innate nature?\" Say: Silence thy tongue, O stubborn polytheist! The innate nature itself was created by His command, if ye but understand. The Herald proclaimed: If thou deniest the verses, what sayest thou about power? Then was confounded he who denied God, Lord of the unseen and the seen. We have seen from the people of the Bayan what the Point's eyes saw not from the people of the Furqan, nor the Spirit's eyes from the people of the Jews. The Bayan hath disowned them, yet they perceive not. God's wrath pursueth them, yet they rejoice. Are they the people of faith? Nay, by my Lord, the Most Merciful! The Bayan curseth them, yet they are thunderstruck. Blessed is he who casteth away desire and taketh hold of righteousness - he is of the people of Baha, inscribed in a preserved tablet. Say: God calleth you to everlasting life, yet ye wander distracted. Cast off the burden of desire, turning to God, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Thus doth the Pen teach you, if ye but know. Can desire profit you? Nay, by your Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved! Say: For Myself, the eye of the All-Merciful weepeth in the garden of the Bayan, yet ye care not. The Maidens of Inner Meaning lament in the palaces of utterance, yet ye laugh. By God! The Most Exalted Pen hath been forbidden from mention and praise, yet ye write what ye understand not. The leaves of the Lote-Tree have yellowed from the blasts of rejection's winds, yet ye hasten in the wilderness of error. The pillars of justice have shaken from your oppression, yet ye slumber behind your veils. Can anything revealed before equal a single verse of His? Nay, by the Manifestation of Grace! Thus hath the All-Merciful testified in the Bayan, yet ye are not fair. Ye have taken desire and cast away guidance - why do ye not reflect? Were ye to hearken with the ear of nature, ye would hear from all atoms: \"The Lord of attributes hath come with the kingdom of verses,\" yet ye turn away from Him. The tongue of power proclaimeth: \"The Beloved hath come\" - a written tablet. Have ye seen anything greater than what hath appeared? Nay, by the Lord of destiny! But desire hath prevented you from your Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. By My life, ye shall not be helped! Say: Is doubt befitting after ye behold the All-Bestower riding upon the clouds? Why do ye look, yet deny? Hath any excuse remained for anyone? Say: Consider, O people! They have denied, and the smoke's darkness hath enveloped them, yet they see not. When verses are recited unto them, thou seest them playing, and when power is manifested, they say \"The like hath appeared in ages past.\" Thus do they treat their heart's wound, yet know not. Say: Nothing shall profit you today, even if ye cling to all in the unseen and seen. This is your Lord, the All-Merciful - to whom do ye flee? This is the King of the Bayan - to whom do ye hasten? Say to him who turned away after accepting: Cast thyself down, then come! Thus commandeth thee the Dayspring of Beauty, as grace from Him, and I am the Generous, the Forgiving. Say: Can desire profit thee? Nay, by thy Most Glorious Lord! Can the first to deny suffice thee? Nay, by the Most Great Scene! Hear My counsel, purely for thy Lord's sake, and follow not every rejected polytheist. If poverty's fear restraineth thee, We shall fulfill thy measure. Verily, thy Lord is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is! If thou fearest for thy faith, read the Bayan detached from all thou hast heard, then behold with the eye of fairness that which hath been sent down from the heaven of certitude by thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Then shalt thou witness the Sun of thy Lord's remembrance dawning from the horizon of proof and evidence, and thou shalt say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Heaven of bounty and Educator of existence!\" By My life! Every proof hath been abashed before My proof, and every evidence hath bowed down before Mine evidence, and all things lament for My sake, could ye but hear. Say: Can ye prevent the sun from its dawning place? Verily it hath shone forth with truth. Blessed are they who possess eyes to see. Say: If ye inhale the fragrance of the Bayan, by God ye shall find therein the fragrance of My garment, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: Have ye taken fancy as your lord and cast behind you the Source of Certitude? What aileth you that ye ponder not? Say to him who turneth away: Dost thou see thyself following aught save that which is in the Preserved Tablet? Say: Be fair, O servant! Were it not for the Beauty, who would assist the Lord of heaven with manifest sovereignty? The pillars of might were shaken when the Tablet was sent unto him from the presence of One mighty and ancient. When We reached the prison, We desired to convey unto all the messages of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Hast thou not seen how We created the wondrous One through the spirit of power and might, and sent Him forth like a ball of fire with thy Lord's chosen Tablet? Can His Cause be compared with aught in creation? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Say: Hast thou seen the like of what hath appeared in any previous Manifestation? Nay, by the Creator of the heavens and earth! Say: Free thyself for an hour for the sake of God's countenance, then read the Tablet with joy and delight, that perchance thou mayest find the fragrance of the All-Merciful and be among the detached. Therein hath been revealed of every matter that which the servants are powerless to comprehend, save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Wise. And therein the Dove of Utterance hath warbled various melodies, though We have restrained the Pen and not loosened its reins, as a bounty to the peoples. Read, that perchance the breaths of revelation may attract thee and render thee detached unto God, the Mighty, the Praised. Say: Dost thou think thy faith profiteth Me or thy rejection harmeth Me, after thou witnesseth that I have never compromised God's Cause with anyone? If thou deniest, every fair-minded one who is well-informed beareth witness for Me. Say: God's proof hath been completed against thee. Choose for thyself what thou desirest. He is indeed independent of all the worlds. O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! Convey the messages of thy Lord. Blessed is he who turneth unto Him, and woe unto them that turn away. Gather My loved ones and remind them from Me, then those who are around thee. Verily thy Lord is the best of rememberers. Aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, and for thee is with Us a mighty station. God shall soon exalt thy mention among His creation for having detached thyself in His love from all else and been among the steadfast. Grieve not for what they say. Nations like unto them have spoken similarly. We seized them and made them a warning to the worlds. And the Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon thy brother and thy mother and thy father and those among thy kindred, and upon those who have believed in this Most Great and Mighty Announcement.\n\nO Samandar! Today thou must appear among people in such wise that through word and deed thou mayest guide those who have lost their way in the valley of heedlessness. The divine fragrance of sanctity must be inhaled from thee, that all creation may thereby turn toward the court of oneness. Beware lest there appear from thee that which beseemeth not thy station. Know thy rank before God and be among the thankful ones. Strive night and day that perchance thou mayest guide a soul from the depths of error to the expanse of guidance.

He judgeth from David's throne and calleth you unto the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nSay: O people of the Gospel! The All-Glorious hath come and summoneth you unto His holy, His mighty, His sublime Kingdom. Cast aside what ye possess and turn unto the Dayspring of proof, Who hath come for your salvation. Follow not every obstinate oppressor. Mention not your sins save before your Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate.

Do ye imagine yourselves to be on the right path or think yourselves to be among the righteous? Nay, by His very truth! The words return unto yourselves, if ye but perceive it.\n\nYe turned away from the people of the Gospel because they paused in the Cause of the Beloved, and from the people of the Torah because they turned away from Him Who came with the truth from the presence of a Mighty, Faithful One. And today ye follow in their footsteps - to this testifieth every fair-minded, knowing one. Have ye any proof greater than what We have manifested in truth, or any evidence mightier than what hath come from the presence of One powerful, ancient? If ye say \"yea,\" then produce it! Then shall ye find yourselves in the wilderness of perplexity with none to help you.\n\nAll things bear witness to the Creator of the heavens Who hath come with the Kingdom of Names, while ye remain in your ancient error.

Were ye not promised this Revelation? Were ye not given glad tidings of this Cause through which the horizon of your Lord's will, the Mighty, the Great, hath been illumined? If ye deny this Cause, by what proof do ye uphold that which ye possess? Cast aside vain imaginings and turn unto God, the Lord of all beings. This would be better for you, were ye but fair-minded. Do ye not see the shining of the Sun? Do ye not find this fragrance which hath wafted from the garment of your Lord's favor, the Mighty, the Peerless? We have sent down verses unto thee and dispatched them that thou mayest be informed of what We have suffered from the idolaters. O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! We counsel thee to remain steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord - this is among the greatest of matters with God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Powerful. Soon shall a putrid odor spread among the concourse of creation. Thus doth He inform thee, with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. When Satan's call is raised there, avoid it and be among the steadfast, such that every contentious matter may be set aright through thee. Beware lest the tempests of allusions move thee, or the words of those who have denied God disturb thee. Be among the stars of steadfastness amidst all creatures. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee from this remote prison. Remember thy Lord with wisdom and utterance among the concourse of creation, that they may arise at God's call and turn their faces toward Him to Whom the faces of those near unto God have turned. Grieve not over the world and what hath occurred therein. Leave it behind thee and turn thy heart to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Were We to recount for thee what hath befallen Us as it deserveth mention, thou wouldst lament until death. But We have been patient and concealed it. Verily thy Lord is the Concealer, the Forbearing. They have committed around Me that which none before hath committed. Whenever We counseled them, they increased in transgression, and when We banished them, they spoke that which caused the hearts of those who circle round the Throne to burn. Verily they are among the companions of the Fire. The stories of the Youth cannot be borne by the tablets of creation, nor can the Pen flow with what hath befallen Him. Thus doth He Who announced Me and manifested My Cause, Who came with truth from the presence of One knowing and wise, inform you. Blessed art thou and he who remaineth steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the steadfast have slipped. Say: Look not at what ye possess, but look upon Me with Mine eye. This is what ye were commanded in the Book, as every discerning one doth testify. Whoso looketh with his own eye shall not know Me, and whoso holdeth fast to what he hath cannot soar in My atmosphere. This is certain truth. Thus were ye commanded by the All-Merciful in the Bayan. He bore witness to Me even as I bear witness to Him, and thereupon the tongues of the Prophets were loosed and they testify from the Supreme Horizon to this firm, decisive, mighty Cause. Say: O concourse of creation! I adjure you by God to open your eyes with fairness that ye may recognize the truth and not be among the ignorant. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee and sent down for thee from heaven, from this luminous cloud, all by My leave, despite My enemies - and say: Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00876 ===\n\n=== START BH00877 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise and glory befit the Lord of Creation and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, Who hath adorned the world of existence with the ornament of names and through the blessed word \"there is naught but doth glorify His praise\" hath made manifest the purpose of creation. His is the creation and the command, His the bounty and the bestowal. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Most Luminous.\n\nThy noble letter, like a spiritual messenger from the city of Divine love, arrived bearing glad tidings of health and well-being and of the unity and harmony of God's loved ones. After perusal it was presented before the Presence of the Lord of creation and attained the honor of His attention. His word, exalted be His glory and mighty His utterance, and there is none other God but Him:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!\n\nO thou who gazeth upon My horizon, who cleaveth fast to the cord of My loving-kindness, and drinketh the choice wine of mystical knowledge from the hand of My bounty! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. Say: O concourse of creation! By your Lord, the All-Merciful! The ocean of bounty hath revealed its pearls, the Most Great Treasury its jewels of mysteries, the ocean of generosity its waves and sovereignty, and the Sun of Truth its lights and effulgence. Beware lest anything among all things, or any name among all names, or any cause among all causes prevent you from turning unto God, the Lord of the Final End.\n\nGlory be to God! All have heard and seen mention of the Day of God in the holy books, tablets and sacred scriptures. Nevertheless they remain occupied with names and are heedless and veiled from Him Who giveth life and death. Most have been and are worshippers of names - some of the name of successor, some of guardian, some of mirror, some of chief and deputy and the like - veiled from the Sovereign of existence by Whose will all have been created. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto a Cause that hath no equal or likeness. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee and enable thee to conquer the citadels of hearts through His Name, the Mighty, the Beloved, and to ordain for thee in every world of His worlds that which shall gladden all beings and console all eyes.\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. By My life! Through unity the horizons shall become illumined and radiant. We beseech God to aid them with hosts of angels and with the forces of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the One Who hath power to do as He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is. Make mention of those who are related to thee and give them the glad tidings of God's loving-kindness. Verily He is with those who love Him and whom He loveth. He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee, and may He assist thee in thy endeavors and love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nPraise be to the Goal of the world, that in every moment the ocean of His bounty surgeth with a wave and the heaven of His grace shineth with a light. His mercy hath no bound and His grace hath no end. All things today rejoice in the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai - a joy the like of which the eye of the world hath never beheld. Blessed are they that are fair-minded and that have attained.\n\nYou have made mention of the deceased and elevated Jinab-i-Bayk, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and likewise mentioned his box which was illumined with divine verses and heavenly tablets. Now let that beloved one consider how many tablets were revealed specifically for one soul, yet they have turned away from this station whose verses and evidences have encompassed the world, and have clung to what their own selves and desires have commanded them. The servant beseeches his Lord to aid them to return unto Him, verily He is the Forgiver, the Generous. The expenses for transport, burial and other necessary arrangements were bestowed, specifically intending that whatever was spent would be from funds dedicated to God, exalted be His glory. According to His command, the box and its contents shall remain with that beloved one until God brings about His decree. Repeatedly has this exalted word flowed from the tongue of the Lord of all beings: \"O servant in attendance! We counsel the friends to show kindness and forbearance, and should you observe anyone heedless, you must remind them through loving counsels and wise exhortations, that perchance they may become mindful or fear God and hold fast in the Day of God to that which befitteth them. Verily our Lord is the Counselor, the Wise.\" The letter received this time was in the handwriting of the beloved of the heart, at whose name's mention the fragrance of love wafts among the servants - Jinab-i-Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. After it was presented at the Most Holy Court, the seas of favors and kindness surged. Indeed, from the beginning of the Cause until now he has been occupied in service and blessed with special bounties. We beseech God - our Lord and the Lord of our fathers - to protect him and His loved ones in all regions and to adorn them with the ornament of detachment and righteousness. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer. In the letter of the beloved of the heart, mention was made of the gathering of the Hands of the Cause, upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, in that land, and great joy and delight were expressed at this matter. By His command, those words must be written, and they are these: \"Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali and other special souls who are teachers - may God increase their like and multiply their peers and aid them in service and triumph and enable them to exalt the Word - all are gathered in this land. Their blessed presence has made this land a rose garden. Though the hand of God's power has banished this exile from His presence, yet through His grace He has blessed me with meeting His near loved ones. Praise be to God, again praise be to God.\" And after this passage was presented in the Most Holy Court, the Ancient Beauty's face showed joy and smile, and likewise He uttered verses beyond this servant's ability to count. The servant beseeches his Lord to aid them in all conditions to that which He loves and is pleased with, that through them the means of unity and accord may spread throughout the lands. Another submission is that the beloved of the heart, Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, has had his letter reach the Most Holy Court every month, and in each letter that beloved one and the Hands of the Cause are mentioned by name. Indeed their love and affection for the friends is great. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to increase their success, verily He is the Merciful, the Generous. Glory and praise and laudation be upon you and upon God's loved ones and friends there, and upon every accepting, assured, firm and steadfast soul.\n\n=== END BH00877 ===\n\n=== START BH00878 ===\n\nHe is the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance!\n\nA mention from Us to him who turned to the Most Sublime Horizon and attained the Living Waters in the days of his Lord, the Most Merciful, and spoke that which the Dove of the Cause cooed upon the branches. Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God testifieth that there is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared with the truth is indeed the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery, and He is the One promised in God's Books of old. Blessed be the people who understand. We have appeared and made manifest the Cause. Among the people are those who denied, those who turned away, those who disbelieved, those who pronounced judgment against the Lord of the seen and unseen, and those who shattered the idols of vain imaginings in the name of the Lord of all mankind in days wherein the Ancient Beauty was established upon the Most Great Throne and the tongue of grandeur proclaimed: \"There is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\" They who have attained the recognition of God are indeed the denizens of the most exalted Paradise in the Preserved Tablet. We bear witness that thou hast turned, recognized, and spoken that which the Tongue hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, and hast answered thy Lord when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. Verily, nothing whatsoever escapeth thy Lord's knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Mighty, the Loving. Take thou the chalice of eternity in the name of the Lord of Names, then drink therefrom in spite of them that deny the signs of God. O Jalil! The Desired One of the world remembereth thee from the Most Great Prison and giveth thee glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for thee by God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is the one with vision who hath beheld the Most Great Sign, and the one with hearing who hath heard when the Call was raised in the Kingdom of Creation, and the one with a heart who hath turned to the Praiseworthy Station. Remember My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My mercy and My favor which have preceded existence. Rejoice thou in that We have remembered thee before, and now once again, as a token of grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thy letter was presented and the servant in attendance hath laid it before Us. We have answered thee with this inscribed Tablet, which, when it descended from the heaven of the Cause, the other Tablets prostrated themselves before it. Thus did My Pen speak when the Wronged One was in this forbidden place. We send Our greetings upon thee and upon those who have taken hold of the Book of God with strength from Him and have drunk the sealed wine in His Name, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Jalil! God willing, thou shalt attain to the most great steadfastness and service to the Cause of the Lord of creation. These are the days that have been mentioned and recorded in all books, scriptures and tablets. The whole world hath been created for this Day, yet all are veiled from it save whom thy Lord willeth. Today, any good deed that appeareth from anyone, purely for the sake of God, shall endure for as long as the kingdom and the heavenly dominion shall endure. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land and gladden them all with the bounty of God, exalted be His glory. Thy letter was presented and the fragrance of steadfastness was wafted from it. This station is most great - preserve it in the name of God.\n\nWhen thou didst inquire about divination (jafr), in truth this is not and hath never been the day for questions, even as the Primal Point, Who gave the people glad tidings of the Lord of the Beginning and the End, forbade all from asking questions in this Most Great Revelation. Some time ago this Most Great Verse was revealed from the Supreme Pen: \"This is not the Day of questions. It behooveth every soul, when he heareth the Call from the Kingdom of Creation, to arise and say: 'Here am I, here am I, O God of Names! Here am I, here am I, O Creator of Heaven!'\" For these fleeting days were not and are not worthy of such things. The souls that are serene, content and well-pleasing should regard time as precious and act in accordance with that which is befitting this Day. That which is visible shall ere long be rolled up like a scroll. Most grievous would it be should man occupy himself with aught else but Him on the Day of God. We have ordained for thee that which will dilate the breasts, gladden the hearts and bring delight to the eyes. Previously, whatsoever was asked from the Dayspring of Divine Knowledge received detailed answers which were revealed and dispatched. In these days We desire to speak on every matter even as the Divine Lote-Tree hath spoken. Beseech ye the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid you in that which beseemeth the Day of God. Were the friends of God to recognize their station in this Day, they would perish from joy and gladness. Give thanks to the Desired One of all worlds that He hath mentioned thee in the Most Great Prison. One word from Him is more exalted than all things. Were people to become aware of its station, they would assuredly sacrifice their lives to attain it. At all times, with the utmost joy and radiance, strive ye to offer the Living Waters to those who thirst in the valley of mystic knowledge in the name of the True One. This service hath no peer or likeness. Today the comprehensive book of divination is that Most Exalted Word which hath flowed and will continue to flow from the Supreme Pen. From it can be derived all that lieth concealed within the tabernacle of God's knowledge. Should anyone reflect upon the verses and that which hath been sent down from the heaven of God's Will, he would testify to that which My Pen hath testified at this moment. The divine worlds have been and shall forever be without end. The deeds of the Prophets and Messengers bear witness to this clear pronouncement. Reflect, that thou mayest know that thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Today no matter among matters and no thing among things can compare with a single mention proceeding from a sincere rememberer. Today man is able to deposit precious pearls in the treasuries of the Trustworthy, the All-Wise. Today is the day of planting, today is the day of fruit, and today is the day of grace and bounty. Beseech ye the True One, exalted be His glory, that He deprive not all from the ocean of inner meanings. Verily He is the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou Who hast, through the light of Thy countenance, illumined all regions and before the manifestations of Whose power all created things have bowed down in submission. I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, Who calleth out with the most exalted call in the Most Great Prison and summoneth the nations unto Thee, that Thou mayest ordain through Thy Most Exalted Pen for Thy chosen ones, Thy loved ones, and Thy friends that which shall shield them from the evil of Thine enemies and draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art He Who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. O my Lord! Aid Thy servants to stand firm in Thy Cause, to arise to serve Thee, and to place their trust in Thee under all conditions. I beseech Thee by Thy glory and the lights of Thy throne to assist Thy loved ones in Thy lands and Thy chosen ones in Thy realms. Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. There is no God but Thou, the Everlasting, the All-Sufficient, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00878 ===\n\n=== START BH00879 ===\n\nHe is the One manifest from the horizon of utterance!\n\nThis is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down to him who hath believed in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, who hath traversed the lands to exalt My Word, to kindle My love, and to cause the dawning of the Day-Star of My Revelation, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nO peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the Call: We created you for My knowledge, caused you to speak for My remembrance, and bestowed upon you insight to behold My signs. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are bidden by God, the Mighty, the Loving. Verily the Euphrates of utterance hath flowed in the realm of possibility, and the path of God hath appeared. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this manifest bounty. We have adorned the heaven of knowledge with the stars of utterance. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty hath come, and the Most Great Branch hath presented it in the Most Luminous Spot. We have answered thee with verses at whose appearance the books of the people have bowed down. He Who possesseth the Hidden Tablet beareth witness unto this, wherein mention was made of him who turned unto My horizon, uttered My praise, held fast unto My cord, and soared in the atmosphere of the love of his Lord, the Possessor of existence. We named him Badi' in the Book of Names and made known unto him My Extended Path.\n\nO Badi'! Upon thee be My Glory. Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. We counsel thee with a word whereby the hearts of the world will be set ablaze. Be a fire in My love, enkindled by My verses, attracted by My melodies, and acting according to what We have commanded thee in My Books, My Psalms, and My Scrolls. Thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Be thou articulate with that which will attract the hearts of My loved ones. Read the Tablet of Wisdom which We sent down aforetime as a grace from Our presence, and I am the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThis is a Day wherein that which would extinguish the fire of existence profiteth not. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of thy Lord, the Possessor of the Unseen and the Seen. How many a wise one hath been prevented from drawing nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and how many an unlettered one hath hastened, taken the choice wine, and drunk in My Name, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWe have assisted thee, taught thee, and made thee known, that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord. Arise unto that which thou art commanded. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from Its praiseworthy station.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Convey My glorification unto his face and give him glad tidings of that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen, that the Call may attract him to My horizon and draw him nigh unto My forbidden station.\n\nWe have desired to make mention of Our loved ones in Bahram and remind them of what hath been revealed from My Pen, and give them glad tidings of My favor, for I am the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nO My loved ones there! Hearken unto the Call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of you for the sake of God and remembereth you with that which attracteth the hearts of them that are brought nigh. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and follow not those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined and the Promised One hath come, and the Jews have believed in Him, yet the people of the Furqan are in manifest error. They mount the pulpits and speak that which melteth the livers of the sincere ones. Beware lest the cawing of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Religion prevent you. Take hold of the Book of God with the power We have given you. This is what We commanded you aforetime and at this time.\n\nWe have mentioned in various Tablets him who was named Muhammad-'Ali, that he may give thanks to his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We beseech God to strengthen him, to aid him, and to draw him nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO people of God! Take hold of that which will exalt the Cause of your Lord, and set aside what ye have heard before. I am, verily, the Counselor, the All-Knowing. By My life! We have mentioned you through My Most Exalted Pen with such a mention as cannot be equaled by the mention of the world, and have revealed for you that which all the treasuries of kings and rulers cannot match. Arise to perform such deeds whose fragrance will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Thus doth command you He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet.\n\nO Joseph Kh! Upon thee be My Glory! He who loved Me hath mentioned thee, whereupon We made mention of thee with that which the happenings of the world can never alter. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty. Preserve this most exalted station through the Name of thy Lord, the Creator of heaven. He, verily, witnesseth and seeth; He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou steadfast in serving the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that neither the hosts of the world nor the promptings of the deceivers, who have turned away from God and committed that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere to lament, shall deter thee. Among them are those who traveled to various regions with another soul. We found them in manifest loss. They presented not themselves before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison to hear the Call of God, the Lord of all worlds. They wandered in the realms of fancy and turned away from the Dayspring of certitude. They departed with conjecture and returned with idle fancies. Thus did their souls entice them, without any clear proof from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. They hastened to the pond and turned away from the Most Great Ocean. To this doth My Most Exalted Pen testify in this Luminous Tablet. Say: Be fair in your judgment, by God, and follow not the ways of the ignorant. The rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary hath been raised before your faces. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this manifest grace.\n\nO Ahmad! There is in My heart no hatred for thee, nor for any of God's servants. We counsel thee with that which God hath counseled thee in His Books, His Scriptures, and His Tablets. Fear God, and be not of the wrongdoers. Lo, the Lote-Tree is before thy face - behold its fruits and its leaves. Lo, the heaven is before the faces of the learned ones and the princes - observe it and its stars. Beware lest thou follow the fancies of the doubters. It behooveth thee to present thyself before the Wronged One and hear what thou hast not heard before. Thy Lord remembereth thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto Him, as a grace from His presence. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus hath the ocean of My utterance surged, and the fragrance of My loving-kindness wafted, and the light of My grace shone forth. When thou findest the sweet scents of My verses, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Aid me to be just and fair, and to gaze upon the signs of Thy Most Exalted Pen with mine own eyes and not with the eyes of others. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the world, to unveil for me as Thou hast unveiled Thy Cause for others. O Lord! Disappoint me not of what I seek from the wonders of Thy grace, and deprive me not of recognizing Thee and turning toward Thy Most Great Cause and Thy Mighty Message. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! We began with a mention and concluded with My loving-kindness toward thee, and every name that was in thy book hath attained unto a mention which, in the estimation of God, is more precious than all things and more exalted than all names. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Creator, my Fashioner and my Maker, for having caused me to turn towards the splendors of Thy countenance, to speak forth Thy praise and remembrance, and to hold fast unto Thy cord. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing ready to serve Thee. I beseech Thee to inspire me with that which shall deliver me through Thy grace and bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be unto Thee, O God of all worlds.\n\nThe glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My dominion be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who love thee, and who hearken unto thy word in this mighty Cause.\n\n=== END BH00879 ===\n\n=== START BH00880 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nThat which was hidden and concealed desired to come forth and be revealed. Therefore, through the Most Great Word, He created whatsoever is beneath Him, of which all others are powerless and incapable to reckon. And since creation was in need of education and refinement, He sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books, dispatching them to His servants with clear proof and manifest evidence, until the Messengers culminated in their Seal and the Books in their most complete form. The bearer of manifestation and revelation, of attributes and names, of knowledge and wisdom, of conditions and appearances and effulgences of the Lord was Muhammad - upon Him be the blessings of God, the Single, the One. Through Him were manifested all names and attributes, through Him did the heavenly spheres revolve and the horizons become illumined, through Him did the idols fall and the standards were raised. And upon His family and companions, through whose arising the servants arose, and through whose aid God aided all in the lands. Through them appeared the straight path of God and His mighty Cause. Through them surged the ocean of divine knowledge throughout contingent being, and the decree of the All-Merciful was made manifest in all lands. This servant beseeches his Lord by Him and by them, and by His chosen ones and pure ones, that He may guide us to His path and draw us near to the court of His good-pleasure, and honor us with that which He has promised us in His Book. Verily, He is the Lord of the world and the Educator of all nations, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Subduer of Names! I beseech Thee by the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and by the lights of Thy countenance in the kingdom of creation, and by the Most Great Word through which Thou didst create earth and heaven, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to be humble before the gate of Thy grandeur, and to act according to that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. O my Lord! We beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Lote-Tree to ordain for us that which Thou hast ordained for Thy near servants and sincere chosen ones, and to assist us in Thy remembrance and praise amongst Thy servants. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor turning toward the ocean of Thy bounty and the unlettered hoping for the treasuries of Thy knowledge. Send down, then, from the heaven of Thy mercy that which befitteth Thy presence and Thy generosity and Thy grace and Thy forgiveness and Thy bestowal. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, before Whose power the might of every mighty one and the power of every powerful one is impotent. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAfter several letters from your honor were received - O brother, this evanescent servant has ever cherished the mention of God's friends, nay, at all times has beseeched the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist him in remembering His friends. However, ignorant and heedless souls have become a barrier. In their utter ignorance, they see good as evil and evil as good. The fire of sedition has encompassed all. The cities and abodes of the people of divine unity have been plundered, as all have witnessed and continue to witness. Where has the might of the people of unity gone, and what became of that power? Not long ago, their very limbs would tremble and their hearts would quake at the might of the sword of the people of unity. O brother, in the Syrian desert during the time of Abu Ubaydah, the commander, sixty men defeated one hundred thousand. What then is this weakness that has now encompassed such power, and what is this abasement that has obliterated the horizon of glory, and what is its cause? Verily, our deeds have caused the ruin of the world, and our heedlessness and transgressions have brought about the power of the enemies. Each day the polytheists seize and carry away a limb from the monotheists. O brother, it is incumbent upon you, upon this servant, and upon all believers in divine unity to hold fast to the cord of return and arise to redress what has been lost. God is witness and testament that His Holiness the Master - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - desired naught save the reformation of the world, and His purpose was the refinement of souls and the education of the people of the earth. Yet when He opened His lips to mention the Lord of humanity and the Sovereign of destiny, the wolves of the earth emerged from all directions and perpetrated that which caused the people of the City of Justice and fairness to weep and lament. God is witness and His Prophets bear testimony that there was no purpose save the welfare of the people of unity. The intention was that rancor and hatred, born of the suppositions and idle fancies of the people of the earth, might be effaced and eliminated, and that hearts might turn to their Author and Illuminator. Nevertheless, they perpetrated that which no eye has seen and no ear has heard. Therefore, beautiful patience, and God is the One Whose help is to be sought against that which they describe. Had ears been found and had they been blessed with hearkening to the Most Exalted Word, the world would have found some measure of tranquility, and likewise the fire of war and contention. Strange that until now we have not reflected upon what has been the cause of this abasement and what has been its reason. O brother, I speak truly when I say that the recompense of deeds - that is, the recompense of the deeds of the heedless - has been mentioned as supreme justice and described as fairness. We are God's and unto Him shall we return. Now what appears to be the cause of extinguishing the fire of oppression in all regions is the return of the people of unity to the True One, exalted be His glory. We must, in the nights and days, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the Self-Sufficient Lord for protection and ask for the return of departed glory. His forgiveness is abundant and His generosity beyond reckoning. Perchance His grace and bounty will encompass all existence and deliver it from these tribulations. He is the Mighty, the Powerful. There is no God but He, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and this world.\n\nThe honored traveler has arrived. Praise be to God, news of that esteemed friend's health and well-being brought joy and gladness. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist your honor in that which ensures salvation in both worlds. You have not been and will not be forgotten.\n\nAs to what you wrote about business matters, engaging in a profession has been and is beloved before God.

Time and again hast thou been mentioned by Me and received the tokens of My Pen. Render thanks unto God for this great bounty. We have been with thee in all conditions and have heard thee make mention of this Announcement at which the limbs of all names have quaked, the hearts of the learned been perturbed, and the flesh of the transgressors trembled. I bear witness even as God hath witnessed, as I have witnessed before, and be not thou of them that remain silent. Remind the people of God's verses and His mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Verily, the Wronged One seeth Himself beneath the swords, yet most of the people are heedless. He hath remembered thee and remembereth thee in this hour when sorrows have encompassed Him through those who have denied God, the Lord of the worlds. We hear that which causeth the heart to bleed. Blessed is he who hath testified to that whereunto God hath testified, and woe unto them that turn aside. Remind the people of My verses and give them the glad-tidings of My tender mercy. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nThe croaking of the raven hath been raised throughout all regions. This is what We have announced to you in diverse Tablets and in this luminous Tablet. We beseech God to aid thee to make mention of Him and to praise Him, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His chosen ones and His trusted ones whom the might of the Pharaohs deterred not from this wondrous Remembrance. My Most Great Branch hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One. We have answered thee with verses that all upon earth cannot equal, and We have turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful. Well is it with thee for having quaffed the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and for having attained that wherewith thou wert promised in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remember the days when thou didst stand at the door and wert present before the Countenance, when thou didst behold My horizon and hear My call. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nWe have honored thy dwelling-place and have sent down unto thee from the Kingdom of grace that which hath solaced the eyes of the sincere ones. That which thou didst send to My Branch hath been presented before the Wronged One and laid before His Countenance. Therefore hath the gate of utterance been opened once again, and We have sent down for each one of them that whereby every sitting one hath arisen, every prostrate one hath soared, every halting one hath hastened forward, and the hearts of those near unto God have been attracted. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them down unto thee as a grace from Our presence, and I am verily the Powerful over what I will. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nWe make mention of thy son on this darksome night, that he may remember My days wherein he stood before My face, heard the scratching of My Pen, and spoke My beauteous praise. We make mention of thy wife who presented herself, circumambulated, and heard that which the tongue of the Wronged One uttered while in His mighty Prison. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who love thee for My sake and hearken unto thy word concerning My mighty Cause.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned regarding Baba Husayn, remember him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. His letter was not presented, yet the Wronged One read it, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Convey My greetings unto him. We have remembered him in such wise as to cause the mountains to soar, how much more minds and hearts. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord. He is indeed the One Who encompasseth both what hath been and what shall be.\n\nWe remember My loved ones in Kaf and give them the glad-tidings of God's mercy, the Mighty, the Loving. We counsel them to manifest the most great steadfastness. Soon will a cawing one appear there and utter that which none before him hath uttered. Pay no heed unto him. Turn with illumined hearts unto God, the Lord of existence. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance, that men may attain certitude in the verses of their Lord.\n\nAs to what thou didst mention regarding trustworthiness, verily We have made mention of 'Ali in such wise that the fragrance thereof shall endure throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. We beseech God to send down upon him at all times mercy from His presence. By the life of God! He beholdeth Me and We behold him, and he heareth My verses at the time of their revelation together with the denizens of the most exalted Paradise. Thus hath spoken the Lord of Names from His praiseworthy station. Should there be a righteous and steadfast son of him who hath ascended, the trust shall be returned unto him, otherwise it shall go to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and whosoever findeth therein a Tablet in My handwriting shall return it to My residence. This is what God hath ordained. Blessed is he who acteth and attaineth, and woe betide every heedless and veiled one.\n\nAs to what thou didst mention regarding him who is named 'Ali-Akbar, brother of one who loveth Me, We make mention of him at this moment as a token of Our grace, for verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O 'Ali-Akbar! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. He remembereth thee from the precincts of the Prison and summoneth thee to the supreme horizon, the station wherein the Call hath been raised to draw thee unto a place where thou shalt hear from all things: \"The gates of heaven have been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty.\" We have stood firm in the Cause before the faces of princes and divines on a day wherein earthquakes seized the tribes of the earth through the might of those who violated God's Covenant and Testament. Thus did their souls entice them, and they are of those who are the most lost, as recorded in a mighty Tablet. We beheld thy devotion and turned toward thee, and We heard thy call and called out to thee from the right side of the luminous Spot, that there is none other God but Him, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Turn with thy outward and inward being toward the Dawning-Place of thy Lord's verses, the Dayspring of His Revelation, the Manifestation of His Self, the Source of His clear tokens, and the Treasury of His knowledge. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto God, the Lord of eternity, and hath taken the chalice of immortality in the name of the Lord of all being, and hath drunk therefrom in His name, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful. This is the Day whereof the Books of God gave tidings aforetime, yet the people are in thick veils. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the Pharaohs of the age, then aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance. Thus doth this Wronged One command thee from this remote station. We beseech God to assist thee and strengthen thee to serve His Cause. Verily He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWhen thou hast drunk from the cup of My utterance the choice wine of My love, and the rapture of the Call from the precincts of My prison hath seized thee, turn thy face toward the House and say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me, made me know Thee, caused me to hear, and guided me unto Thy straight path. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause, whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts of the world, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge, O Lord of eternity, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, in such wise that the clamor of the people shall not prevent me, nor shall the might of those who have denied the Resurrection terrify me. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom and the mysteries of Thy utterance to aid me to remember Thee and praise Thee and assist Thy Cause. O Lord! Withhold me not from Thy sealed choice wine, whose seal was broken by Thy name, the Self-Subsisting. Then preserve me from the croaking of those who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs and have risen to mislead Thy creatures. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\n=== END BH00881 ===\n\n=== START BH00882 ===\n\nThe esteemed physician, upon him be the Glory of God\n\n4 Dhi'l-Hajjih 1300\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!\n\nO beloved of my heart and he who is remembered in my soul! This year the signs of grief have encompassed all, and the banners of sorrow have been raised. From all directions tribulation hath rained down upon the people of God. The enemies sit upon thrones of gold while the friends languish in prison. Glory be to God! Such heedlessness hath seized the negligent that they have become oblivious to that which profiteth them and are occupied with that which harmeth them. Were they to know, they would lament and cry out. They have regarded ephemeral dominion as lofty stations, to such extent that they have deprived themselves of everlasting bounties. Those whose sole thought was the betterment of the world have been seized unjustly, and now the cry of these oppressed ones riseth from diverse prisons. God, exalted be His glory, will not overlook this injustice, for it hath occurred without cause. That beloved one of the Name of God - upon him be all My most glorious Glory - and likewise the friends of God - upon them be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] - have witnessed and know that there is no purpose save reformation, education and fellowship. Their hearts are illumined by the light of the blessed Word \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth,\" and their tongues bear witness to that which God hath testified unto Himself, acknowledging and confessing it. These holy souls have been seized with utmost tyranny, though they themselves went forth and spoke with perfect steadfastness of truth and righteousness, such that the truthfulness of the world beareth witness to their truthfulness, and uprightness is manifest through their rectitude. It is evident then to what degree sorrows have reached and how high the dust of grief and anguish hath risen. The hem of grace was nigh covered with dust. The servant is powerless to make mention of this station. The matter is in God's hands, the Lord of all mankind. This culminated in a new calamity which seized me with such sorrow that my heart lamented and mine eyes shed tears, for it pertaineth to your honor.\n\nAt the time of arrival in Beirut, they requested presence and meeting. They said that the honored physician - upon him be My glory - had been summoned for some time and had previously attained the presence and meeting. Now it is best that he act according to the wish of the honored physician and set out with utmost haste. Then what was destined came to pass and he ascended to the Supreme Companion. What more can the servant say regarding this other calamity and supreme catastrophe? After submission to the Most Holy Court, they spoke that which this servant is powerless to mention. At the end of the utterance, the tongue of the Kingdom spoke this supreme word: The honored physician hath this year borne numerous afflictions from every direction - on one side the hardships regarding the House, on another the tribulation of the friends in the hands of the wicked, and from yet another quarter news of this calamity. We beseech God to strengthen the honored physician - upon him be God's loving kindness - and adorn him with the ornament of patience and forbearance. My Lord! Pour forth upon him patience from Thy presence and forbearance from Thyself. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous. The End.\n\nIndeed a strange matter has transpired. That exalted deceased one suffered what he suffered in that path, and his possessions were plundered and looted. One named Abdul-Wahab, under the pretense of safeguarding them, himself plundered all the deceased's possessions, both cash and goods, seizing them and revealing this to no one - despite Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, being nearby in Alexandretta and Beirut. Yet he did not inform him, and he concealed it from Jasim, upon him be the Glory of God. That hunter was a plague that passed through this wilderness, and as mentioned, a falcon came and snatched from the owl what it had deceitfully taken possession of. And this added to the sorrows. The purpose of mentioning this is not about the property, but rather such false beings who deceive the loved ones in the name of truth have been and are the cause of greatest grief. Although in most Tablets these exalted words are recorded, He says: \"Believe not every speaker, and trust not every arrival.\" There are many such utterances, yet the ornaments of the world are so attached to deceit that one is astonished. It is very clear and evident that the people of Iran do not freely turn to these directions. Most who are accused of treachery, theft and satanic deeds leave their homelands and wander about, claiming to each sect their way - to the Qadiri they claim to be Qadiri, to the Nimatullahi they claim Nimatullahi, to the Babi they claim Babi, and so forth. And the friends and companions accept merely on word and consider them truthful and trustworthy, although the companions of truth should be keen and perceptive. He says: \"The believer is not stung twice from the same hole.\" Nevertheless, these companions have been repeatedly deceived and are still not awakened. I beseech and implore the Truth, exalted be His glory, to assist all to that which is befitting.\n\nAs for what Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God, has written on your behalf requesting permission to attain the presence - this was presented. He said: \"Without doubt or uncertainty the physician desired to meet Us before and desires so in all conditions. He has attained again and again, and has drunk time after time. He has attended, seen and heard. He is indeed among the successful ones in a clear Book. Now, regarding the matter of the House, if their stay here is prolonged, perhaps new events will occur. If they are assured about this matter, they may turn to the Face, otherwise return is preferable until God brings about His decree.\" It is very clear and evident that the Wronged One has loved and loves meeting His loved ones. My physician bears witness to this, upon him be My care, mercy and glory. Peace be upon him and upon those with him, and the mercy of God and His blessings. End.\n\nPraise be to God, the grace and favor are of such magnitude that they need no interpreter and seek no translator. The favor is as clear and evident as the sun. Blessed are you and congratulations to you. The servant sends greetings to Hazza and Sheikh Abul-Qasim, upon them be the Glory of God, and asks his Lord to strengthen them, make them successful, and ordain for them the good of the hereafter and this world. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, by His Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most High Name. The care of God, our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven, be upon you and upon those who act according to what they were commanded in His Clear Book.\n\n=== END BH00882 ===\n\n=== START BH00883 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power!\n\nMy God, my God!

I beseech Thee, O Ordainer of all things and the One Who called from the Mount, I implore Thee by Thy Name through which the horizon of manifestation was illumined, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will diffuse the fragrance of Thy riches among Thy servants. O Lord! Thou hearest the call of Thy loved ones and beholdest their humility before the revelations of Thy grandeur. I beseech Thee not to change their glory into abasement, nor their exaltation into debasement. I testify, O my God, that Thou hast raised them through Thy power and exalted them through Thy will and purpose, until their mention soared throughout Thy realms and their attributes among Thy creation. By Thy might, O Sovereign of existence and the One manifest through Thy Name, the All-Loving, they desired naught save the exaltation of Thy Word and clung to naught save the cord of Thy grace. Ordain for them, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and adorn them with such ornaments as shall illumine the earth and heaven. O Lord! Withhold them not from the ocean of Thy mercy, nor from the revelations of the Orb of Thy grandeur. O Lord! I am Thy servant, and this is Thy Day wherein the earth hath been illumined by the light of Thy bounty, the heaven by the radiance of Thy countenance, the seas by the breezes of Thy generosity, and the mountains by the flowers of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Self-Subsisting, the Almighty. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nO God, O Sovereign, O King! This scanty merchandise is known through Thy Name; exalt it through Thy power. All tongues speak by Thy might and acknowledge Thy power. From this drop, cause to flow the river of wealth, and from the ocean of Thy grace, the waves of abundance. Thou art the One with power to prefer a handful of dust above the heavens. Grant these servants dwelling in the shade of the Tree of Glory and shower upon them the rain of Thy grace and bounty. Thou art powerful and mighty. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Beloved of my heart! Thy call is the cause of exultation and the reason for enkindlement, and the hearts of lovers yearn for this exultation, for it hath been set in motion by the Sovereign of His Will and made manifest through the King of His Purpose. The letter arrived and the world arrived, for its horizon was adorned with the name of the Beloved and illumined by the light of His knowledge. After perusal, it was presented before His presence, whereupon He said: \"Upon thee be the peace of God and His mercy. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to manifest through you that which shall endure through the endurance of His attributes, and to send down upon you from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence, and to exalt you through His Name among His servants, and to spread your traces through His grace and generosity. Praise be to God, ye have attained unto that which hath no likeness. This is the essence of glory, this is the treasure of wealth, this is the source of exaltation and the repository of the pearls of the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds. And We beseech Him to adorn all possibilities with the lights of your trustworthiness, your religiosity, and your steadfastness. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Peace be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken unto your words concerning the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\"\n\nIt is hoped that the river will flow and the horizon will be illumined, and the light of trustworthiness will prevail and encompass all regions, for it is evident to all that this party hath had and hath no purpose save the reformation of the world and the edification of the souls of nations. God, exalted be His glory, is witness and testifier to this. In such case, His grace will surely encompass all and His bounty will prevail. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nI convey greetings to the spiritual beloved and true friend, his honor J, upon him be God's peace and grace. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, that through his being complete reform may come to pass in all matters, and that which is the cause of joy and the source of gladness may be made manifest. Such grace has not been and is not far from the All-Bountiful Lord. We beseech God, our Lord and your Lord, to ordain his meeting and presence, for verily He is the Ever-Present, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nLikewise, I convey greetings to the spiritual beloved, one of the two Most Great Names, his honor M.H., and to all other chosen ones, upon them be 95 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. I beseech from the ocean of divine bounty that which will illuminate the world with the light of justice and fairness. Verily He is powerful over all things and is informed of and sees what is in the heart.\n\nConcerning what was written about the spiritual friend, Aqa Siyyid Faraj'u'llah, upon him be God's peace, and likewise the mention of his patience, tranquility, submission, resignation, contentment and trust - these matters were presented and attained the honor of being heard. What his honor 'Ayn has written is correct and is confirmed. Praise be to God, the unitarians have been and are content with the blowing of the winds of divine will and heavenly destiny and decree. Their endeavor is service to the Cause and their purpose is the good-pleasure of the Beloved. This is the greatest adornment - blessed is the soul whose temple is adorned thereby. O 'Ali, upon thee be My peace. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to him and console him. We beseech God, exalted be He, to cause his father to enter the highest Paradise with the angels and the Spirit, to make him the companion of the Prophets and Messengers, and to send down upon him at all times that which indicates His grace, care, generosity and bounty. Verily He is the Generous, the Munificent.\n\nPraise be to God, they intended the goal, arrived and attained. All the powers of the world are incapable of limiting this greatest bounty. Blessed is he and blessed is he who has ascended, and woe unto him who has denied God's grace, mercy, care and generosity - verily he is among the most lost in His clear Book.\n\nThe Sun is rising, dawning and shining - what more can an atom say or mention? This servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to manifest a special deliverance for his deliverance and ordain that which is the cause of salvation in this world and the next, for we have not been and are not aware of what harms or benefits us. He is the Knowing, the Informed. None is aware of the requirements of His consummate wisdom. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nRegarding what was written about his turning towards Iran, after presentation they said to consult and act upon whatever becomes manifest.

The Countenance of the Beloved hath appeared and the Speaker of Sinai hath spoken. This, verily, is the Promised One mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds.\" Blessed is he who hath heard and answered when the Most Exalted Pen spoke and the Most Great Word appeared through this Name whereby the feet of the learned slipped and the hearts of the doubters were perturbed. Blessed art thou for having turned towards the Countenance when every heedless and remote one turned away. Blessed art thou and thy father, whom We made a dawning-place of knowledge. By the life of God! He became aware of that which none else was aware. My tongue in the kingdom of Mine utterance, the mighty, the wondrous, beareth witness to this. He perceived the fragrance of the garment before its appearance and spoke in praise of it before its manifestation. Exalted be this bounty which encompassed him, and exalted be this station whereof the Most Exalted Pen maketh mention in this Great Prison.

Thus doth the Mother Book command thee from this station wherefrom the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of Lords!\"\n\nWe have shown forth the clear tokens and set forth the verses, yet the people remain in heedlessness and behind a veil. We make mention of those whose names thou didst cite in thy letter, that they may rejoice in this mention which, when it appeared from the mouth of thy Lord's Will, caused the earth to quake and the mountains to pass away. And We make mention of him whose name is adorned with the two B's (Baba), who was imprisoned with thy father, that he may be assured that His knowledge encompasseth the earth and the heavens.

At every moment that Manifest Beauty calls out with sorrowful voice to His loved ones, summoning them to the victory of God's Cause, not to the victory of His own sacred Self. For from time immemorial and unto eternity He has sacrificed His blessed Self in the path of the All-Glorious, as is evident to every fair-minded observer that in all their days they have not sought to protect themselves from enemies, but have ever shone like the sun in the holy firmament - none deny this save every deprived deceiver.\n\nThus it is clear that by victory is meant the triumph of God's Cause, and ever shall be. By God! If a soul should draw but one breath in aid of this wondrous and exalted Cause, it would equal all the acceptable deeds of the dwellers of earth and heaven - nay, it cannot be compared with anything, would you but reflect. Their victory through the sword of utterance and the tongue is beloved of God, not through swords of steel, for They have never been pleased with harm to any soul, and in all verses They emphasize this matter.\n\nThe King of Creation declares: O Javad! Draw forth the sword of the tongue from the scabbard of utterance through the power of the All-Merciful, and proclaim this Cause in such wise that no created thing shall find means to turn away, for these loved ones are aided by the Holy Spirit when they speak. O Javad! The brilliant morn has drawn breath from the Merciful Breath, and \"by the Dawn when it breathes\" has once again become manifest. Strive mightily, God willing, lest the darkness of corrupt souls and satanic temples with the veils of the polytheists conceal this luminous morn from the eyes of men.\n\nO Javad! Several wolves have appeared in sheep's clothing. One must at all times take refuge in God to remain protected from the deceptions and schemes of these deceivers who have plotted against the Lord of all worlds. O Javad! Today if all who are in the heavens should claim divinity and chant the verses of the first and the last without mention of your Lord, the Most Exalted, in His final advent through His Most Glorious Name, they are and shall be rejected. For the creation of words is like unto the creation of souls - just as the purpose of creating souls has been the recognition of God's Self, the purpose of creating their words, from whatever tongue they may flow, shall be the mention of Truth. And if this station be absent from the melodies, they shall be like the words of the marketplace - nay, the latter is more excellent in God's sight, even should those melodies be uttered in the most beautiful tones.\n\nConsider the lamp-niche - though it be fashioned of delicate glass or brilliant crystal, its purpose is to hold the lamp. If it attains not to this station, it is but a useless instrument that neither nourishes nor avails. Thus the purpose of the niche of words is the kindling of the lamp of the mention of the All-Beautiful, and without it they are but satanic whispers, even if that book of words be observed to encompass the kingdom of names and attributes.\n\nO Javad! The purpose of the trees is the human temples which bear the fruits of knowledge. If a tree is not honored with this grace, it is deemed as a withered garden tree, worthy of being cut down and burned - and would that it be burned for preparing the feast of the Beloved! And perchance it may be taken to cook the food of the polytheists according to what their hands have earned aforetime. We seek refuge in God from this! O Javad! My appearance among the loved ones and my standing amongst the enemies in days when every man was shaken and all hands trembled from the might of those days was a clear proof, greater than the proofs of the first and the last, were people to be fair. There was and shall be no proof of My Self save My own Being. The purpose of verses was to establish the Cause among people who were veiled, otherwise those who drink the purest wine from the Most Glorious Cup recognize Truth by Truth and look to naught else. O Javad! By God! My manifestation among these people is greater than the creation of the heavens and earth and all that was and will be, but the servants are dead in the stupor of their own selves. In these days the children of the sanctuary speak such verses that the hearts of those near to God remain enthralled and astonished. And this is not difficult for God.\n\nSome time ago the Surih of the Companions was revealed from the heaven of eternity and the right hand of the Most Great Throne, and was sent in the name of God, the Most Great, to His Eminence the most luminous, most radiant and most glorious - upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Eternity. Mention of your honor was made in that wondrous tablet. Request it from them that you may attain to the revealed divine favors. And the glory that has shone forth from the horizon of the countenance of Glory be upon you and your family.\n\n=== END BH00885 ===\n\n=== START BH00886 ===\n\nIn the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise, sanctified beyond all that can be imagined, befitteth the most impregnable and most holy court of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, Who through the first Word which shone forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of His Will, brought into being the worlds of Command and Creation. Through that Word was made manifest all that was made manifest. Whatsoever can be conceived of the Day of Resurrection, the Hour, and their conditions, appeared through Him. Glory be to God! The Most Great Exposition shone forth from Him. Fire and light, exaltation and abasement, felicity and wretchedness, guidance and error, belief and unbelief - all became manifest in creation through His appearance. Exalted be His grandeur, elevated be His power, and all-encompassing be His dominion! He is the One with such might that neither the cawing of the crows, nor the denial of the infidels, nor the clamor of the polytheists, nor the turning away of the divines, nor the power of princes could deter Him from His purpose.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee to ordain for Thy loved ones the good of this world and the world to come. O Lord! This is Thy Day wherein the ocean of Thy grace hath surged, the fragrance of Thy bounty hath wafted, the heaven of Thy generosity hath been raised up, and the sun of Thy giving hath shone forth. I beseech Thee not to drive away those who have turned toward Thy gate, nor to deprive them of the outpourings of Thy days and the rain-showers from the heaven of Thy mercy. Thou art He Who, through a letter of Thy Hidden Name, opened the doors of the mysteries of Thy Books and Scriptures, and through another letter made manifest Thy Path, Thy Evidence, and Thy Way. O Lord! Take the hands of Thy loved ones with the hands of Thy power and might. Verily, Thou art the Chosen One and the Lord of the righteous. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Compelling.\n\nThereafter, some time ago this evanescent servant sent a detailed letter to that spiritual beloved containing Tablets, verses and papers. As the reply was delayed, no further submission was made until this day, the second of Dhi'l-Qa'dih, when that honored one's letter written to his honor Afnan - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty - was sent to this land. That letter brought glad tidings that the aforementioned letter had arrived. Praise be to God, news of health, well-being, joy and gladness arrived, and the arrival of the letter and message in one instant adorned heart and soul with the ornament of joy and delight. I beseech the True One, exalted be His station, to ever grant these moths such strength that they may soar at all times and journey through cities and regions. After reading and reviewing it, I proceeded to write this letter. If you wish to know about affairs in this land, praise be to God, as before, all are engaged in the remembrance, praise and glorification of the True One, exalted be His glory. The honored Afnans - upon them be the Most Glorious Beauty - resided in this land for some time under the shade of the blessed Divine Lote-Tree, attaining at every moment to a bounty and being sustained by the blessings of the utterance of the Beloved of creation. After fulfilling their promise, they returned to Beirut as commanded. Their place was both empty and not empty, for specifically in every gathering there was mention of the honored Afnans and other friends in the Most Holy Court. This truly is eternal salvation and everlasting success. Praise be to God Who fulfilled His promise and manifested that which was inscribed by the Pen of Revelation in a Book which none knoweth save our All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord. At this moment, the binding command hath descended from the heaven of the decree of the Ancient King. His word - exalted be His glory, universal be His bounty, and great be His station.\n\nO Amin, upon thee be my Baha! In all conditions keep thine eyes fixed upon the exaltation of the Cause. The Supreme Pen hath testified and doth testify to your deeds, and hath mentioned your services rendered purely for His sake - a mention that shineth like the sun in the Book. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this great bounty. However, We counsel thee to keep thine eyes fixed upon the horizon of glory. The loved ones of God must be reminded, with the utmost joy and fragrance, and with their gaze fixed upon the Word, of His exalted utterance: \"Remind them, for surely remembrance benefiteth the believers.\" Whosoever is enabled to perform deeds with joy and fragrance is recorded among the sincere ones in the Manifest Book; otherwise, none should ever reproach him. Today the True One, exalted be His glory, regardeth the hearts and the pearls hidden therein. Such is the way of the True One and His chosen ones, exalted be His glory. Ye must supplicate on behalf of the loved ones and friends that the True One may assist all to act according to what is in the Book, and that neither vain imaginings nor worldly conditions may hinder them.\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan, upon thee be my Baha! Fix thy gaze upon the glory of the Cause and speak that which attracteth the hearts and minds. The demanding of the Rights of God hath never been and is not permissible. This decree hath been revealed in God's Book for certain necessary matters which have been ordained through divine causes. If someone, with utmost contentment and joy, nay rather with insistence, wisheth to attain this bounty, it may be accepted; otherwise, no.\n\nExert your utmost that what hath been revealed may be acted upon. Send the Tablets of the Land of Kha. Much time hath elapsed. From there Jinab-i-Haji Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, hath repeatedly expressed his helplessness and pleaded that the Tablets which were requested be sent. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist you in His service as He assisted you before. Praise be to God, you are mentioned in every gathering and assembly in this blessed Prison. The Tongue of Grandeur hath repeatedly mentioned you before the emigrants, the residents, and the pilgrims. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous One, and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nIn these days, responses to the communications from the Land of Ya are being sent as commanded. We implore God, exalted be His glory, to bestow sight and hearing, that all may hear the call and behold the horizon of the Cause with their own eyes. Wherever you may be, convey greetings and salutations from this evanescent one to the friends and loved ones of that land. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make each one of His party like unto a mountain rather than a straw. The hurricanes and tempests of the polytheists have never been and shall never be capable of moving the former, by God's might and power; however, the latter is moved by every wind and inclines toward any direction. I beseech God to grant even the straw the strength and majesty of a mountain. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things. Glory, remembrance, and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds, and praise be to Him Who is the Goal of the mystics.\n\nThe Servant\n\n2 Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1302\n\n=== END BH00886 ===\n\n=== START BH00887 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraised be He Who hath revealed Himself and sent down what He willed, Who speaketh on the Day of Reckoning, Who summoneth all to love and fellowship, and Who guideth them to the straight path. Glory and exaltation be upon those who have sought the ultimate goal, the highest aim, the loftiest summit, and the supreme horizon, and who have aided the Cause of God with pen and tongue and with their wealth in the Day of Reckoning. These are servants who have attained unto the sealed wine, whose seal was broken by the finger of the will of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. They heard and responded and hastened until they reached the shore of the Most Great Ocean, from whose surging waves every hearing ear heard what the ear of Moses heard on Sinai of the mysteries of the Revelation. Blessed be their footsteps for their haste, their eyes for what they beheld, their tongues for what they uttered, and their hands for what they took with submission and acceptance of the Book of God, the Lord of all names.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations! I beseech Thee by the Cause before which no cause can stand, to assist Thy loved ones and friends to serve Thee and Thy Cause. Then preserve them, O my God, from the promptings of self and desire, and draw them nigh unto the station wherein is heard the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful, and Thou art the Hearing, the Responding One.\n\nThereafter, it is submitted that your letter dated the first of Dhi'l-Qa'dah was received and after review was taken to the Blessed Presence and entirely presented. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the Witness, the Hearing One!\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! Thou hast attained unto the recognition of God, glory be to Him, hast drunk from the cup of His love, and hast been enabled to serve His Cause. Know thou the station of this most great bounty and supreme gift, and occupy thyself with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds through wisdom and utterance. Soon will the rains of mercy and blessing descend from the heaven of grace upon every steadfast one. This is what is mentioned in the first life, and in the hereafter there is ordained for him what cannot be described by the tongue nor recorded by the pen. Glory be upon thy father, upon thee, upon thy brothers, upon those who have attained unto the presence, upon those who have believed in God and desired to draw nigh and attain His presence, and upon every one who hath turned and recognized this mighty Day.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and praise, and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to assist the friends that they may arise to compensate for what hath been lost and remain steadfast in what they have learned. The Command is in God's hands, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nHis Holiness the Name of God - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - hath mentioned you and expressed satisfaction, and likewise mentioned some of the friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of recognition of the Beloved of all possibility. All praise be to God, they have attained unto the outpouring grace and are honored with the mention of the Goal of the world. This is a bounty that decline cannot seize and neither the heat of the sun nor the moisture of water can harm. God willing, may all be assisted to preserve this most mighty station.\n\nThe mention of those souls who were named in the letter of the one who is God's Name was presented before Him, and unique, wondrous and exalted verses were revealed from the heaven of grace for each one. God willing, may they attain unto these and drink from their oceans of inner meanings.\n\nJinab-i-Mashhadi Isma'il, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived. Praise be to God, he was enkindled with the fire of love and spoke in remembrance of the Peerless Friend. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, took hold of him, for his pilgrimage and turning was accepted, even though he set out on the path without permission. However, henceforth you must observe the command, meaning prevent souls from disobedience. None should come without permission. The prohibition has been clearly revealed in the divine Tablets. If anyone comes without permission, their harm will be many times greater than their reward. His honor must arise to serve the Cause with utmost dedication, that its signs may appear in creation. Verily our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Compassionate, the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Informed.\n\nAs for the mention of Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God he is successful and has attained God's grace. In truth, it is the sincerity of his honored father that has shone upon those regions. Once these words flowed from the tongue of the Divine Purpose, exalted be His utterance: \"From that tree,\" meaning his honored father, \"enduring traces and ripe fruits shall appear.\" This station is now concealed. The Herald of Truth and the Informer of Truth - exalted be this great bounty. May Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali be successful in all conditions. Due to the upheavals in those regions and the ignition of the fire of sedition, they were prevented from coming to the Most Holy Court. They have permission to come. God willing, they will attain in days of tranquility and assurance. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nTo Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, I convey greetings and salutations. May he ever drink from the Kawthar of divine love and gaze toward His horizon of grace.\n\nThe mention of Jinab-i-Haji Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was at the end of the letter. Blessed is he, then blessed is he! His mention was presented in the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of grace, exalted be His utterance: \"O Muhammad Husayn! We have heard your call and answered you, and found from you the fragrance of love. We have turned to you from the direction of My Most Great Prison. Rejoice in that the Wronged One has remembered you while in the hands of the heedless. The world and all within it shall perish, but what has been revealed for you from My Most Exalted Pen in this lofty station shall endure. My Pen bears witness, and My tongue, both outward and inward, that there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be thou gazing toward My horizon, speaking My praise, and arising to serve My wondrous Cause. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds.\"\n\nThis servant conveys greetings and salutations to him, and congratulates him for having attained the mention of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is he and blessed is he who has attained this mighty, exalted station. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you all and upon those who are with you, and upon those who have acknowledged what God has acknowledged and what the tongue of His grandeur has testified when He was established upon His mighty throne.

Hear what the Speaker of Sinai uttereth in this praiseworthy station. Verily there is none other God but Him, the One, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Loving. We have mentioned thee and thy father aforetime in such wise that your remembrance shall endure throughout the worlds of dominion and kingdom. Let not the happenings of the world grieve thee, nor the clamor of humanity frighten thee, nor the doubts of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed prevent thee. Cast aside the people and what they possess through a power from Us, and take hold of the Book of God with such strength that neither hosts nor ranks shall hinder thee. Thus have the spheres of wisdom and utterance revolved by command of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\n\nWe have desired at this time to make mention of him who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion. Verily thy Lord is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is. O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who chose for himself a path unto God, the Lord of existence, and believed in Him when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and who drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of his Lord's bounty, the Lord of the seen and unseen.\n\nO Rajab-'Ali! Upon thee be the glory of God, His loving-kindness, His mercy and His grace. Thou hearest and beholdest thy mention from the Ancient Pen in this Most Great Prison, and the Wronged One's establishment therein through what the hands of those who disbelieved in God and His signs have wrought, who denied His proof and broke His Covenant by following every ignorant rejected one. I testify that thou didst turn unto Him when every heedless and veiled one turned away. Blessed art thou, for the Tongue of Grandeur hath moved to make mention of thee in this station round which circle the Concourse on High and the angels brought nigh.\n\nI testify that thou didst hold fast to the cord of the Cause in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the turning away of those who turned from Him Who in every condition proclaimeth \"There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved\" could deter thee. Thou art he whom neither the hosts of princes frightened, nor the doubts of divines, nor the gestures of jurisprudents. Thou didst turn and hear what the Son of 'Imran heard on the Mount of Knowledge. Thou didst fulfill God's Covenant and His Testament, and acknowledged what He revealed in His Book. Blessed art thou, O thou who hast turned toward the lights of the Face, who speaketh My praise amongst the servants, who hath clung to My robe and held fast to My stretched cord.\n\nThou art he whom the might of the people did not weaken. Thou didst speak in the innermost heart what none save God, thy Lord, knoweth, and bore witness to that which the Desired One bore witness, and didst achieve that which none of the ancients achieved, save whom God, the Lord of the Frequented Fane, willed. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty, the light gleaming from the direction of immortality, and the fragrance wafting from the garment of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all men, be upon thee, O thou who didst attain the knowledge of God when the parties held back therefrom.

Perchance thou mayest succeed in serving His Cause and protecting the peoples of the earth from former vain imaginings. Perchance the light of unity may shine forth from the horizons of men's hearts, and all may attain that for which they were created from nothingness into being.\n\nOne word is mentioned for the sake of God, that perchance it may become a barrier between the manifestations of fancy and the dawning-places of the Sun of certitude, and they may understand that which preserveth souls from the conjectures of the heedless, the doubts of the infidels and the cawing of the croakers. How many were the divines, mystics and jurists who in past ages and centuries were occupied with the mention of God and, with utmost humility and supplication, besought from the All-Possessing the appearance of the Most Great Luminary. At dawn their tears would fall and their sighs would rise, yet when the days of His manifestation appeared by the will of God, exalted be His glory, and the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of divine Will, all turned away. Not content with mere rejection, they proceeded to cut down the Blessed Tree with the swords of their idle fancies. And now the divines of Persia openly curse the Truth from their pulpits without any veil or covering. They have committed that which no faction in the world hath ever committed.\n\nHearken unto the call of the Wronged One and arise to serve His Cause with such steadfastness that no agitation may shake it. Reflect upon the deeds, actions and words of the former people. He verily will aid thee and enable thee to hold fast to the Straight Path of God and His Great Announcement. We counsel thee with that wherewith God hath counseled His loved ones in His Book. He is, verily, the Sincere Counselor, the Trustworthy. Behold the Tree and its fruits, the Sun and its radiance. This blessed word hath repeatedly been revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. Hold fast unto it and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, and my Support, for having guided me unto Thy path from which most of Thy creatures have turned away, and for having given me to drink of Thy sealed wine through Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, and for having caused me to hear Thy sweet call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause that hath encompassed earth and heaven, by Thy power before the faces of the princes, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance in the kingdom of creation, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, arising in Thy service, and speaking Thy praise amongst Thy servants with wisdom and eloquence.

Blessed are they whom neither the tales of the past and future prevented from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful's utterance, nor did the rejection of the rejectors and the opposition of the oppressors hold back from turning to the Truth.

This is the ninth day of Ridvan, O my God, and on this day one of Thy loved ones hath, as a token of his love for Thy Beauty and in the eagerness of his devotion to Thee, invited Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dayspring of Thy glory to leave His room in the prison for another. There he hath spread before Thy presence such of Thy gifts as he hath been able to provide, notwithstanding that the people had plundered all his possessions and the possessions of others among Thy loved ones. O Lord, since Thou hast gathered them round Thee and aided them to attain this surpassing grace, endue them with constancy in Thy Cause and bind their hearts together in such wise that no differences may arise in their midst. Grant, then, that they may guide all people unto this Luminary, the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld and which standeth peerless in the realms of the seen and the unseen. Thou well knowest, O Lord, that it hath been the desire of all that circle round Thee to receive Thee during the days of Ridvan. A few have been enabled, in accordance with their means, to attain this honour, while others, through its want, have been prevented therefrom. These have contented themselves with passing round in white vessels that crimson-coloured wine that is brewed from the leaves of China. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Word which Thou hast made to be the lodestone of the hearts and souls of men, the Word whereby Thou hast drawn Thy servants unto the heaven of Thy loving-kindness and the horizon of Thy grace and bounty, to accept from the former all that they have accomplished in Thy path and to ordain for the latter the recompense of whatsoever they had purposed to accomplish. Thou, verily, art the Lord of bounty and generosity, of grace and glory. O Lord, help certain souls among them to know their own selves and to restrain their tongues, lest they utter that which would abase their stations and bring their works to naught. Thou, verily, hast power over all things.\n\nO Lord, hear Thou the lamentations of the sincere amongst Thy loved ones who were hindered from meeting Thee during these days, days which Thou hast ordained as a festival unto Thy people and as a treasure and honour unto the inhabitants of Thy realm....

Thou, verily, hast power over all things.\n\nLook Thou moreover, O my God, with the glances of the eye of Thy mercy, upon Thy loved ones who are scattered in the land of ?a. They have tarried there ever since they were prevented from seeking shelter beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy oneness. O Lord, deny them not the things Thou dost possess. Verily, Thou art the Ruler of the heavens and of the earth. No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Desire of all them that have recognized Thee!\n\nThe glory of Thy might beareth me witness, O my God! It behoveth all to lay down their lives for the sake of Thine ear that heareth the cries of Thine ardent lovers in every land and the sighs of Thy friends who suffer at the hands of Thine enemies.

May my entire being be offered up as a sacrifice for Thy patience, O Lord of might and power! May my soul be a ransom for Thy forbearance, O Thou the fear of Whose wrath causeth the hearts of the dwellers of the kingdom of names to tremble!\n\nPraise be to Thee, O solace of the hearts of the people of Baha! I testify, O my God, that none besides Thee can fathom Thine inscrutable wisdom or apprehend the truths and mysteries enshrined in all that hath proceeded from the manifold tokens of Thy power and the manifestations of Thy will. I entreat Thee moreover, O my God, to graciously enable my loved ones to show their hospitality unto Thee through their character and their conduct, that the heavenly table of Thy loving-kindness may thereby be spread before all Thy servants and that all the peoples of the world may gather round it. This, verily, is the true meaning of offering hospitality unto one's fellow men. Thy might and Thy power are, verily, equal to all things.

Your letter was presented before the face and what was written therein was observed. Praise be to God in all conditions, for by His grace He has preserved the devoted servants from the odors of the polytheists and protected the temple of understanding with the armor of spiritual meanings from the arrows of the deniers and the malicious ones. This is among the greatest gifts of the Lord.\n\nInquiry was made about the established mirrors of this most wondrous and most impregnable Revelation. Today no one is bound by such matters, for the Sun shines forth and radiates by itself, and all must move by the thread of servitude and hold fast to the truth. By Him Who holds my soul in His hand, this station is greater than all stations and is regarded as the most exalted of ranks in the sight of God, for through pure servitude the truth has been and will be established among humanity.\n\nBy God, besides Whom there is no other God! Had what was witnessed not been witnessed of the deceit, trickery and corruption of the leaders of the Bayan, and had all been seen united and gathered upon the Cause of the previous Manifestation, nothing would ever have been mentioned except servitude. But God's command is His, both before and after. Today the nearest, most exalted, most detached, most illumined, most God-fearing, most knowledgeable, and purest souls are those from whom nothing is witnessed save pure servitude, as is clear to every person of insight.\n\nIf today anyone should act contrary to what has been mentioned, the Cause of God will be wasted among the people, for many enemies from among the Bayan eagerly desire such matters to arise and for souls to arise with claims. By my life! If people were to find and comprehend the sweetness of servitude, they would become detached from all else. Do not consider the Cause of God as vain nor His Manifestation as idle, such that any soul might desire to make claims.\n\nThe wondrous Manifestation appeared in the year sixty and gave tidings to the people of this most great Manifestation, as has been explicitly stated throughout the Bayan. And besides Him, whosoever has stood firm in His Cause and followed what was revealed - these are guides unto Him. Thus was the command, if you but knew.\n\nSay: O people! Fear God and waste not His Cause. Gather beneath His shadow and this suffices you above all good, if you but know. There is no greater bounty than this, if you but understand. Beware, then beware, then beware, then beware lest you be veiled by what you possess. Follow God in His commands, then remain steadfast in His remembrance, His praise, and the promotion of His Cause, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWalk not in the paths of pride and arrogance. Be humble before His countenance, submissive before His beauty, and prostrate before His Self, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThose souls who are known today for their support of this Cause, whose mention has been revealed in the Tablets - respect for these souls is incumbent upon all, so long as they remain firm and steadfast in the love of God and His Cause. This is the word of truth which falsehood does not follow, if you but understand.\n\nIf in every day a manifestation were to appear, the Cause of God would never spread throughout the earth, and surely consummate wisdom would be rendered void. Glory be unto Him above this! Beware lest you differ in the Cause of God. Gather upon the law of His love and be not among the dissenters.\n\nIn response to that one who associates partners with God - the letter \"J\" - a servant present before the Face has recorded some divine verses that were revealed regarding this matter. Nevertheless, it is strange that you have asked again. Never pay attention to such matters that cause the Cause of God to be wasted. Let all dwell in repose in one station beneath the shade of the raised heaven which is the Manifestation itself. What is desired today is that all should appear among people with purity, sanctity, humility, submissiveness and pure servitude, so that all people may turn toward God's direction through witnessing the deeds and actions of those assured souls. It is incumbent upon every soul to teach the Cause according to their capacity, but with perfect humility and submissiveness, not through conflict and disputation, for the decree of killing, bloodshed and opposition has been entirely lifted in this Manifestation of the Sun of inner meanings. We have repeatedly stated this, yet people do not understand. By Him Who holds my soul in His hand, if people had acted according to what they were commanded in this Manifestation, now most of the people of the earth would be seen adorned with the robe of guidance and radiant with the lights of God. But what was destined has come to pass. God willing, henceforth they should move according to God's good-pleasure, not according to their selfish desires. Thus was the command revealed before and now, and God was witness to that.\n\nGod is greater than what people imagine! God is greater than what they mention, what they suppose, and what they say! Still no one has comprehended the appearance, encompassing nature, greatness and power of this Manifestation. Therefore they have not arisen to love Him and His Cause as they should. Moreover, they have engaged in corruption and committed what they have committed without God's permission. The harm of everyone's deeds has returned to the Root of the Divine Tree, just as that one who associates partners with God went to the great city and attributed to the Truth all that he, his companion, and the people of the Bayan committed in these numbered years - even though all souls witness and testify that in all days and nights We have been occupied with reforming the affairs of the corrupt ones, and have forbidden all people from everything God detests through decisive proofs, goodly counsels and firm statements, as all servants witnessed and heard during the years of Our sojourn in Iraq. Nevertheless, what befell Us befell Us. Now the Beauty of Divine Unity sits waiting to see when the ordained trials will descend. May my soul be sacrificed for His soul, my spirit for His spirit, my essence for His essence, and my beauty for His beauty, if you be of those who know!\n\nGod willing, may all accept the divine counsels given in loving kindness and gather at the stream of inner meanings. This has been and will be the foundation of victory.\n\nAs for what you mentioned regarding your brothers, We beseech God to decree for them what is best for them and to deliver them. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book, and He has power over all things. The Spirit, glory and splendor be upon you and upon those with you among the loved ones of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. And praise be to God, the Beloved of those who know Him.\n\n=== END BH00890 ===\n\n=== START BH00891 ===\n\nO friends of God, upon you be the Glory of God! He is the Remembering, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO noble one, upon you be the Glory of God, the Single, the One! Ask the contemptible Shi'ites what fruit their acknowledgments of immediate successorship yielded on the Day of Grace, which is the appearance of the Luminary of Justice. Were they to be fair, they would say: \"Our turning away became the station of acceptance, our denial became the station of recognition, our oppression became the station of justice, and our tyranny became the station of equity.\" To this testifieth every learned one, every mystic, every hearer, and every perceiver.\n\nO Kiyumars! Today the Most Great Scene is illumined with the light of the Lord of Destiny. The divine call is raised from every direction. There hath befallen Us tribulations such as have befallen no one else, and afflictions at which every fair-minded and perceiving soul hath lamented. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to cause thee to hear that which the Speaker of Sinai hath spoken in this Revelation, at whose appearance, when He was established upon the throne, the nightingales of utterance warbled their melodies upon the highest branches. He Who was hidden hath appeared, and He Who was silent hath spoken. Blessed is the servant who hath found the fragrance of utterance in the days of his Lord, the Most Merciful, and hath acted in accordance with that which he was bidden by the All-Knowing Commander.\n\nO Bahram! The All-Knowing hath mentioned thee time and again, and hath made His mention a treasure for thee in the Kingdom. Rejoice at these glad-tidings, whose fragrance, when diffused, caused all things to cry out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds!\"\n\nO Khudabakhsh! Hearken unto the Call of God, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. He hath mentioned thee in such wise as cannot be equaled by the ornaments of the world nor by whatsoever the nations possess. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear the rustling of Thy Luminous Tree and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and praise be unto Thee, O Possessor of the Beginning and the End! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst seize every oppressor and subdue every obstinate tyrant, to assist me in all conditions to aid Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance before the faces of all religions. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Almighty over all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Mihriban! Upon thee be the Glory of the All-Merciful. Reflect upon the deeds of the oppressors. In every age and century they have visited upon the Daysprings of Divine Revelation and the Manifestations of Divine Power that which caused all things to lament and wail. They cast the Friend (Abraham) into the fire and prevented the Interlocutor (Moses) from claiming His right. Say: My God, my God! Open unto the faces of Thy loved ones, through the key of Thy Most Great Name, the door of bounty and generosity, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of all nations! I beseech Thee to assist the children of the Friend to manifest that which befitteth Thy days and to perform deeds that may attain the glory of Thy acceptance. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nO Jamshid! From all directions tribulations have descended and calamities have been sent down. The oppression against this Wronged One hath become so evident that the owner of one of the newspapers hath arisen with such tyranny as hath had no like in the world. He hath cast aside fairness, seized upon oppression, and hath spoken that which none before or after him hath spoken. To this testifieth My Great Announcement in My Perspicuous Book. He hath regarded this people as without helper or assistant, and hath confirmed matters whose falsehood he himself witnesseth, following the opinion of souls whose lies and calumnies he himself hath testified to. Glory be to God! That which he hath written contradicts itself, the latter part belying the former. O Jamshid! Leave them and their like to their vain imaginings. \"Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return.\"\n\nO Khudabakhsh! Beseech the True One to unlock a gate of utterance in the land with the key of His Most Bountiful Name and to open it unto the faces of His loved ones, that the world may be perfumed with the sweet fragrances of truthfulness, justice, fairness and grace. Say: O my Lord! Aid Thy servants to remember Thee and Thy loved ones, and enable them to do that which befitteth Thy bounty and Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Kaykhusraw! The priests are seen to be deprived of the breezes of revelation from the Purpose of all worlds. The ornaments of the world have prevented them from the effulgences of the Most Great Name. Most of the people today have turned away from godliness and have embraced transgression and wickedness. The sea is surging by His Word and the sun is shining by His Will, yet the people are heedless and turned away. The recompense of deeds shall become manifest. Blessed is the soul that hath inhaled the fragrance of the Revelation and hath attained unto the hearing of that which the Speaker of Sinai hath uttered. Woe unto every heedless and veiled one, and every rejected polytheist.\n\nO Shahpur! Rejoice that the countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and hath remembered thee with that which shall cause its fragrance to endure throughout the eternity of His Best Names and Supreme Attributes. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous, the Helper, the All-Wise. Arise to serve thy Lord despite those who have denied God's Revelation and His proof, who have disputed His might and grandeur and sovereignty, and who have rejected that which hath appeared from Him before the faces of His servants. And say:\n\nO my Lord! The imagined hath sought Thy manifest light, and the sea of impotence hath turned toward the ocean of Thy bounty and power. Deprive it not of that which Thou hast ordained for the gems of Thy creation who, when they heard the Call, exclaimed: \"Yea, verily, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven!\" and bore witness to that which God had testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Shahjahan! The Refuge of the world hath come, but He hath come in an age of the blind. They hear and deny; they see and turn away. The lights of the dawn of Revelation have encompassed the world, and the Standard of Sinai is manifest upon the highest station. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Prevent not the eyes of hearts from turning toward the Sinai of Thy knowledge and from beholding the Sinai of Thy majesty and power. Thou art He through Whose Name the traces of the Pharaohs were obliterated and the standards of tyrants were reversed. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to aid me in serving Thy Cause and in standing firm as befitteth Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy right hand are the reins of the affairs of the first and the last.\n\nO Bahman! We have aided Bahman in matters whereat the power of the world was non-existent and void. We promised all leaders that which would be the cause of greatest joy for those who are fair-minded and have turned unto Him. However, some forgot God's covenant and others broke His pledge. Say: O priests! The fire of love is ablaze, the light of bounty is radiant, the ocean of mercy is surging, and the sun of truth is luminous. Forsake what ye possess; perchance ye may attain unto that which God possesseth. Great is this Day and great is its mention. Say: We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid all to do what He loveth and pleaseth. Verily, He is the Master of Religions and the Lord of men and jinn.\n\n=== END BH00891 ===\n\n=== START BH00892 ===\n\nIn His Name, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious\n\nI testify that through thee hath been adorned the Book of Love amongst all creatures, and embellished the brocade of affection through thy love and sincerity for God, the Lord of all worlds. How can this evanescent one make mention of him whom God hath related unto Himself? Blessed art thou for having attained unto this sublime, lofty, mighty and ancient station. Ye are they who are mentioned before the Throne, and ye are they who gaze upon the countenance of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous - He at Whose grief all things have lamented, and by what befell Him the sincere ones, the Messengers, and the denizens of the highest Paradise do weep.\n\nAlthough this evanescent servant was and is unworthy of mention, yet the sweet fragrances of thy love are so diffused that I felt compelled to intrude with this letter. His honor Amin and his honor Abu'l-Hasan, upon them be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Trusted, have arrived and are frequently occupied with thy mention. Numerous exalted Tablets have descended from the heaven of the Lord's Will specifically for thee and those who circle round thee, and were sent. However, before the departure of his honor Amin, his honor Aqa Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, intended to travel, hence this letter was ventured. Two or three months ago, that is, during the days of Ridvan, a letter arrived from his honor Aqa'i, the Name of God M.H., upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, from the direction of ?adba, containing certain names, for whom exalted Tablets were also revealed and sent. Among them was mentioned his honor Shaykh S., upon him be the Glory of God, for whom two Tablets were revealed, one in Persian and one in Arabic, and likewise for his sons. Also, numerous exalted Tablets were graciously bestowed without names, that they might give to whomever they wish. Some of these Tablets were sent with his honor Amin and some with his honor Aqa Hasan.\n\nFurthermore, at one time when this servant was present before the Throne, the Blessed Countenance turned to this servant and the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words: Write to him whom God loves and who loves God that they should never relinquish wisdom in any circumstance and should act with moderation, for if the Cause exceeds wisdom it will cause sedition, and sedition causes distress to the weak ones. Therefore, with consideration for them, you must act in such a way that no harm occurs. After the martyrdom of Badi' We commanded preservation, especially for those like thyself who are engaged in service to the Cause. Although preservation has been and will be in God's hands, since He has commanded wisdom, therefore you must strive with utmost effort to observe it. Thus have ye been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. You must surely exert mighty effort and noble striving in this matter. Thus doth God explain to those whom He loveth; verily He is the Protector of the sincere ones.\n\nFurthermore, his honor Amin will present the details of this land. In truth, he has labored extensively and is wholly occupied with service, not slackening for a moment. His reward is with God Who created him and assisted him to recognize Him, turn to Him, and serve in His path. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nWhatever was in my mind from the utterances of the Dawning-Place of Names and Attributes, and which I was commanded to submit to your honor, I have submitted according to my capacity. Otherwise it is evident that He is able to mention divine utterances as they truly deserve. Convey greetings to the honored brother, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and to the assured, content souls who are in your presence - to all of them from this evanescent servant convey greetings. We beseech God to assist all to serve Him and to be steadfast in His Cause. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nThey mentioned that your honor had sent an amount specifically for Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Glory of God. As commanded, it was left with Aqa Muhammad Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, so that whenever someone travels to Mosul it may be sent. Likewise, on behalf of Mulla Muhammad-'Ali an amount along with a box of tea was left with this lowly one specifically for the aforementioned one. Until now its dispatch has been delayed as no one was traveling. God willing it will be sent.\n\nWhatever has reached Jinab-i-Amin has reached completely and fully, nay even more. Sufficient for him is what was revealed concerning him: \"Verily he is the Trustworthy one before thy Lord, the Mighty, the Generous.\"\n\nFurthermore, in the letter of Aqay-i-Ism'ullah M.H., upon him from all glory its most glorious, it was written that your honor had beseeched God, exalted be His glory, that seven might end in eight and conclude with the name of that Beloved One. This was submitted before the Divine Throne. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke, smiling, and said: \"Verily We have made him the first of these and their last. Exalted is this wondrous and lofty favor.\" End quote.\n\nFurthermore, it was written that some souls who have newly attained to the stream of recognition desire to turn towards the Most Great Scene. This was submitted to the Most Holy Court. He said: \"Most certainly prevent them, for without permission it has not been and will not be permitted.\"\n\nAgain I submit that the Tablets which were presented, some of which were given to Aqa Hasan, were again given to Jinab-i-Amin, as the aforementioned one was intending to travel by another route. A Tablet specifically for Aqa Mirza A.B., upon him be the Glory of God, was revealed from the heaven of will. Whenever they deem it advisable they may deliver it. I entreat and hope from your honor that to each of the loved ones of God who are present in that gathering you will convey most wondrous and most mighty greetings from this evanescent servant. The Glory which has shone forth from the Sun of the name of my Lord, the Most Glorious, and then the salutation which has risen from the horizon of grandeur be upon you and upon those who are related to your honor and upon the loved ones of God who are honored to serve you. How excellent is this for you.\n\nThe Servant 66 \\[of God\\]\n\n15 Jumada 1290\n\nAccording to what Jinab-i-Amin mentioned, the honored brother, upon him be the Glory of God, had requested a sample of this lowly servant's unworthy handwriting. Therefore I wrote and sent the Most Holy, Most Mighty Tablet which was revealed on the blessed night of the Birth specifically for them. It was intended to write and send specifically for your honor as well the Most Holy, Most Mighty Tablet which was revealed this year on the Most Great Festival, but due to the abundance of writings and the sudden departure of Jinab-i-Amin as commanded, there was no opportunity whatsoever. God willing it will be written and sent later. Furthermore, one page of the wondrous handwriting of the Most Great Branch, may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps, was graciously given specifically for the \\[son\\] of that beloved one.\n\n=== END BH00892 ===\n\n=== START BH00893 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One True God, the All-Knowing!\n\nO Joseph! Thou art seen to be deprived of the fragrance of the Merciful's garment. Strange it is that Jacob's eyes were illumined by the fragrance of his son's garment, yet the vision of thy recognition, despite the diffusion of the fragrances of the Merciful's raiment throughout all creation, remaineth clouded by the ophthalmia of idle fancies. Art thou dwelling in the valley of hesitation even after the very stones cry out: \"Hasten ye to the scene of your Lord, the Chosen One\"? This beseemeth thee not, shouldst thou be of them who are endowed with insight.\n\nBeloved is he who rendeth asunder all veils through the name of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and ariseth from the horizon of the heaven of acceptance, turning toward the Kaaba of Beauty. Cast away thy vain imaginings! By Him Who illumined the dawn of utterance through the light of His Name, the Most Merciful, wert thou to ponder on that which We have sent down aforetime unto thee, thou wouldst swoon away, and upon rising, thou wouldst exclaim: \"I believe in the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause and the Source of Thy Revelation, O God of the worlds!\"\n\nImmerse thyself in the oceans of the words of the Most Merciful which flow from the fountainhead of the Pen of Utterance, detached from all else, that perchance thou mayest attain unto its hidden pearls. O Joseph! The Divine Word among human utterances is even as the sun, manifest and resplendent. Deceive not thyself. Consider the revealed Tablets and reflect upon the manifestations of power and the divine conditions that have encompassed the realm of creation, that thou mayest attain unto the Ancient Ocean and the Most Great Name. If thou hast not succeeded in heeding the divine counsels revealed from the Pen of Divine Might in this Revelation, then consider, wholly detached from all else, the Persian Bayan sent down from the heaven of Divine Revelation. By My life! If thou wert to look upon it with the eye of certitude, thou wouldst behold thyself shining forth from the horizon of detachment, hastening unto God, the Lord of Creation.\n\nO Joseph! Awaken at the call of God and say: \"Here am I, O Kaaba of the yearning ones!\" He saith: \"Be not veiled from the Bayan and what hath been revealed therein and its letters from the Dawning-Place of the command of the Most Merciful.\" Yet thou remainest veiled from the manifest Sovereign by one whom thou hast not seen and of whose cause thou knowest naught. Think not that any benefit or harm returneth unto the Truth from thy acceptance or rejection, or from that of the peoples of the world. By the Truth itself, verily He is independent of all the worlds.\n\nIn all times the Ancient Beauty hath been and shall be afflicted in the hands of the oppressors. The arrows of hatred from the direction of the idolaters have at all times rained upon the Manifest Beauty. Nevertheless, purely for the sake of God, He inviteth all else to turn toward the Lord of Power and the Most Great Horizon. If thou shouldst find the sweetness of but one word from among the words of God, thou wouldst forsake the world and all that is therein, and by the power of the Most Great Name soar above the kingdom of earth and heaven, crying out amongst the servants in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Joseph! Turn away from the pond and set thy face toward the ocean of My Name, the All-Powerful, each drop whereof proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!\" Turn away from the tree that hath been planted at the gate without right, then turn with thy whole being unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Canst thou find today any refuge or shelter for thyself? Nay, by His very Self, wert thou of them that know! Draw forth the hand of trust from the bosom of detachment, then rend asunder the veils that have held thee back from turning toward the Creator of all things. This is better for thee than all that is in the heavens and earths. Be not of them who said \"God is our Lord,\" yet when He appeared in truth they disbelieved and turned away until they descended to the lowest of the low. If thou deniest this proof, by what proof wilt thou uphold that which thou believest? And if thou deniest this power, by what power wilt thou hold fast and be of them that turn unto God? Wouldst thou ask the Jews concerning that which the Spirit (Christ) spoke, or the people of the Gospel concerning that which Muhammad, the Apostle of God, brought? This indeed would be a grievous wrong. If thou art in doubt concerning a matter, ask God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things, to make clear unto thee what thou desirest. He verily is the Unfolder, the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Wert thou to reflect upon this Cause, thou wouldst testify that He is the Originator of the heavens and earth, and that nothing more wondrous than this hath appeared in all creation. To this testify all atoms and beyond them the tongue of God, the True, the Faithful King. Set aside the left and turn unto the right through thy Lord's grace. Say: \"Aid me, O my God, to recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Cause, the Dayspring of Thy signs, and the Source of Thy inspiration. O Lord! I am poor and Thou art the All-Possessing, the All-Powerful. O Lord! Deprive me not of the gift that hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy bounty, nor of this cup proffered by the hands of Thy favors. Draw me nigh unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. I testify that Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou willest.\"\n\nO Joseph! Since previously the fragrant breezes of faith were inhaled from thee, therefore this Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will, that perchance through the fragrant breeze of the utterance of the All-Merciful thou mayest attain to the kingdom of exposition, and not wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and the valley of bewilderment. Observe thou the consummate wisdom of God, that in that Guidance which was previously revealed and sent forth from the Pen of Command, We concealed two stations, and thou didst enquire about them. Nevertheless, from the Pen of Will there appeared no fitting explanation concerning the mention of those two stations. We concealed them in the divine treasuries of knowledge for these days, that thou mightest become aware of them and ask about the wisdom of their concealment. Yet thou wast so heedless that it never occurred to thee. Ponder thou upon this, that thou mayest comprehend what was decreed aforetime and be assured that with Him is the knowledge of all things in a perspicuous Book. Although these are not days for questions and answers - it behooveth everyone, when hearing the Call, to turn to the horizon of the Revelation of his Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and say: \"Yea, yea! Here am I, here am I, O Beloved of the worlds!\" - yet the purpose is that thou shouldst understand that there was wisdom in the concealment of those two stations, whereof thou wast unaware. We beseech God, should He wish, to assist thee to know Him and draw thee nigh unto a station round which circle the near angels. Praise be to God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. O Joseph! The Cause is mighty, mighty! Observe how mighty it is when He declareth that the loftiest Tree of affirmation in that Dispensation becometh lower than the most inferior tree of negation. Yet thou hast regarded this mighty Cause as insignificant and hast paid, and continuest to pay, no heed to it. Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, Who from the horizon of the prison calleth out: Abandon what thou hast heard and return to the direction of the Chosen One.\n\n=== END BH00893 ===\n\n=== START BH00894 ===\n\nHe is the One Who createth as He willeth in the realm of creation!\n\nSanctified beyond all likeness and exalted above all diminution is the Lord, the Possessor of the source and the end, Who through His all-encompassing power and His simple will caused the Sun of Truth to shine forth from the Dayspring of knowledge and wisdom, and illumined the world of limitations with the lights of the Luminary of unity. Every eloquent one confesseth his powerlessness to describe His might, and every articulate soul acknowledgeth and admitteth his inadequacy to praise His grandeur. Glory be unto God! What a surging ocean it is, wherein the swimmers in the seas of knowledge and wisdom are powerless to swim in its depths, and the divers in the billows of learning and understanding fall short of bringing forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance therefrom. Every wave thereof is an eloquent book proclaiming His power, and every drop thereof is a conclusive proof manifesting His grandeur. The minds are bewildered in comprehending Him, and thoughts are perplexed in perceiving His waves. He surgeth by Himself and for Himself, and casteth forth the pearls of knowledge, wisdom and utterance by Himself and for Himself. Exalted is He above being comprehended through descriptions, and sanctified is He beyond being characterized by mentions. The wondrous praise, glorification, magnification and splendor rest upon the Mirrors of His names and attributes and the Manifestations of His power among all created things - those Essences Who, through the subtle favors of grace, guided those lost in the wilderness of ignorance to the fountainhead of knowledge and wisdom, and led those bewildered in the desert wastes of remoteness to the goal of nearness through the gems of wisdom and utterance. Upon them be the blessings of their Lord as long as His most excellent names endure and His most exalted attributes remain.\n\nThus, the first letter of that spiritual loved one, which expressed degrees of affection and subtle intimacies of friendship and wisdom, became the cause of the expansion and gladness of hearts. In truth, it was a sufficient remedy for the malady of heartfelt sorrows and an adequate book for the manifestation of the signs of love. Praise be to the peerless Lord Who, through the subtle expressions of His bounty, has enabled His friends to achieve that which is befitting, and caused them to abide beneath the shade of the Tree of grace and favor. We beseech the wonders of His favors and are supplicants and hopeful of the subtleties of His benevolence, that He may ever cause that loved one to dwell beneath the shade of grace and be sustained by the fruits of bounty and the pure water of favor. He is the Generous One Whose grace hath no visible end and Whose bounty and bestowal hath no apparent limit. His giving hath encompassed His loved ones and His mercy hath preceded His chosen ones. Verily, He is kind to those who ask, gracious to those who seek, and merciful to those who hope.\n\nAt the time of hastening to reply, he attained the court of presence and mention was made of you. This is what shone forth from the horizon of the utterance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. His exalted Word: \"O 'Ali-Akbar! From every direction thy call is raised and heard. The Most Great Branch is now present with thy letter, therefore We make mention of thee again, that thou mayest thank thy Lord. By the life of God! That which hath appeared at the Most Exalted Threshold hath no parallel. Never was it imagined that treachery and falsehood and calumnies would appear in the world to such an extent. In any case, they acted according to the decree of their guide - surely you know who their guide is. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist the treacherous ones to trustworthiness, the liars to truthfulness, and the calumniators to justice and fairness. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, He is the Forgiver, the Merciful. Convey My greetings to those who are with thee and give glad-tidings to all My loved ones of My grace and favor. Verily, We counsel them to trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and sincerity. The treacheries committed have caused grief to the people of the city of justice and fairness. Each day a new calumny appears. Despite all their treachery and abominable deeds, they still claim to be speaking the truth. Thus do their souls entice them. We testify that they are among the most lost. The Glory be upon thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever, nor any matter, hath prevented from drawing nigh unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" End.\n\nO beloved of the heart and one who clings to the hem of friendship! Your latest letter has been received, which expressed your love for the Lord of destiny, your steadfastness in His Cause, your orientation towards Him, and your submission before Him. I beseech my Lord, the Mighty, the Most High, to protect you beneath the shadow of His loving-kindness and grace, and to aid you to serve His Cause morning and night. As to what you wrote regarding the veiled ones and your meeting and discourse with them - well done! I ask God to assist you in rending asunder the veils of the deluded ones and burning away the shrouds of the heedless, and to guide through you His wandering servants to the paradise of recognition of His manifest Cause. By your life, O beloved, one is astonished at the heedlessness of these people - how they have veiled themselves from that which is best for them in this world and the next, and have clung to that which profits them not, oblivious to what the Creator of all things has intended for them. It behooveth us to grasp the hem of hope and supplicate God, the Creator of all things, morning and evening, to preserve us from their insinuations and to assist us in tearing away the greatest veil that has prevented humanity from turning to the most pure horizon. The people are asleep, knowing not what benefits them nor distinguishing it from what harms them. Had they known, they would not have denied this Cause which has appeared only to safeguard their rights, elevate their souls, protect their stations, and enable them to attain what is best for them in their beginning and their end. Blessed is he who has recognized this supreme bounty, known his Ancient Lord, and whom nothing has prevented from turning toward the direction of his Lord's loving mercy.\n\nO my God, my Lord, and my Hope! Praise be to Thee for having favored us on this momentous day with the recognition of Thy mighty and loving countenance, and for having taught us that which Thy servants have neglected, and for having guided us by the light of Thy luminous utterance to the paradise of Thy nearness and the gardens of Thy grace. Were we to thank Thee throughout all existence, we would be powerless to render thanks for even the least of Thy bounties which we have received in Thy days. I beseech Thee to grant us tongues that speak Thy praise and thanks, feet that stand firm on the path of Thy love, and hands raised toward the direction of Thy grace and loving-kindness. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. Protect us by Thy might beneath the shadow of Thy protection from the insinuations of the wretched ones and the idle fancies of the ignorant, and increase our certitude in Thy Cause and our sincerity in Thy love.

The tongues of all created things bear witness to His grace, His bounty, His might, His grandeur, and His glory. Glory, peace and radiance be upon His loved ones, whom God hath adorned with the ornament of chastity and trustworthiness, and made them the manifestations of His most beautiful names in His dominion. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth and the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nAnd now, the letter of that spiritual beloved hath arrived. Praise be to God, it was adorned with the recognition and confession of the oneness and singleness of God. After it was read and perused, it was raised to the Most Exalted Summit and presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, and was honored to be heard. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nO Muhammad-Rahim! Upon thee be My glory! Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant was presented before the Divine Presence. It indicated and demonstrated the grace of God, exalted be His glory, towards thee. Praise be to God that thou hast been enabled to discharge thy debts. \"And whosoever placeth his reliance on God, He is sufficient unto him.\" That which hath been the key to prosperity and the opener of the gate of success was revealed aforetime from the Supreme Pen. His grace hath reached and continues to reach. Verily, He is with those who love Him and desire Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee a dawning-place of goodly deeds and virtuous character amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Convey My greetings to those who are with thee and to those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. Give glad-tidings from Me to My loved ones and My leaves there of God's bounty, His mercy, His might and His bestowal. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good. Glory be from Us upon thee and upon those who have heard the call and responded to their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe bounty and generosity belong unto God. He hath sent down from the heaven of His munificence upon His loved ones that which hath caused the sweet fragrances of His grace, His mercy and His generosity to waft among His creation. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nThou didst mention thy spiritual beloved, Haji Muhammad-Karim and Haji Shukru'llah, upon them be the glory of God and His favors. After presentation in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these manifest verses dawned forth and shone from the Dayspring of God's loving-kindness. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who have today attained unto that which shall endure forever in God's Book. This is a bounty that shall never be overtaken by decline. The atoms of creation have testified and continue to testify to its station. He is our Sufficiency, our Refuge, our Shelter, and the Sufficiency of all things. His Word, blessed and exalted be He \\[...\\]\n\nO Muhammad-Qabl-i-Karim! We have made mention of thee in these days and have sent unto thee that which hath caused the Kingdom of Utterance in the realm of existence to quiver, and before whose manifestation the books of all peoples have bowed down. The Mother Book in the Final Return beareth witness to this. We make mention of him who hath attained My presence and stood before My face, and who was named Shukru'llah in the Book of Names. From the Most Exalted Pen at this hour: O Shukru'llah! Thou hast been honored with the mention of the Wronged One. No conceivable power can equal it, nor can any comprehend it. Give thanks unto thy Lord through this clear utterance.\n\nAll praise be to God! His favors have been continuous. None can reckon them save His All-Knowing Self. The servant beseecheth his Lord to send down upon them both a breath from the breaths of His presence and mercy from the heaven of His bounty. Verily, He is the One Who hath power through His sovereignty and dominion through His command, the Wise, the Strong.\n\nMention was made of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-'Ali and Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented before His presence, the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of God's will, saying - and His word is the truth:\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! The loving-kindness of God hath ever been directed towards His loved ones, and He hath mentioned each one with words that are enduring and eternal, whose fragrance shall never be cut off from the world. We beseech God to confirm thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest attain unto that which is the primary cause for the manifestation of creation and the greatest means for the reformation of the world. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My mention and clung to the hem of My mercy. He is indeed among those who are brought near in the Book of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nO Muhammad-Mahdi! The Remembered One calleth and maketh mention of thee, and seeketh for all that which is the cause of eternal salvation. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained unto mention by the Most Exalted Pen. All things shall perish save that which hath been sent down from the presence of the Ancient of Days.\n\nHis is the loving-kindness and bounty, His the majesty and might and glory. He hath mentioned each of the loved ones with that which is peerless. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful, and praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of them that know.\n\nRegarding the Huquq, the honored Ismu'llah Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious and resplendent Glory, hath mentioned the details which were presented before the Most Holy Court and were accepted. According to the command of the Beloved of hearts, it hath been assigned to the honored Amin, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, that he may act according to the manifest will shining from the horizon of decree. Verily our Lord is the Commander, the Ruler, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nRegarding permission for attaining His presence, after presentation permission was granted, however it is contingent upon the requirements of wisdom, for the decree of wisdom hath been revealed and established in most of the Tablets, and all are commanded to observe it. And specifically for the Leaf, the wife, upon her be the Glory of God, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent, that her eyes might be consoled thereby and she might be among the thankful.\n\nAnd regarding what was written about the payment of debts and God's ordinance concerning the payment of Huquq, according to the command: after the payment of debts, whatever remaineth, the Huquq becometh applicable thereto.\n\nPraise be to God that they were enabled to pay their debts. This matter hath ever been and will continue to be well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord of all worlds. Such is indeed a righteous deed. The payment of debt is the greatest pillar of trustworthiness and godliness, and is an urgent obligation. Praise be to God that that beloved one was assisted, enabled and adorned therewith. The grace and favors of God have ever been and will continue to be with them that act. He is the Helper of them that act, the Bestower upon them that turn unto Him and them that are steadfast. The servant beseecheth God, his Lord, to assist thee in that which will cause thy name to endure among names and thy remembrance to last among remembrances. Verily, He is the Helper of His loved ones from beginning to end. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon them that are with you.\n\n=== END BH00895 ===\n\n=== START BH00896 ===\n\nPraise be sanctified above the intimations and allusions of contingent beings, befitting the Necessary Being Who, through one exalted Word, drew the people of the earthly realm to the supreme horizon, such that they detached themselves from wealth, riches, ornaments and all worldly treasures, and gave freely in the path of the One Beloved all that was a source of light for the world's darkness, a dawning-place of sight for those blind in the wilderness of error, and a sweet fountain for those thirsting in the desert of ignorance. Exalted be their qualities, magnificent their stations, and lofty their ranks! They heard, turned, and answered their Lord on a day when the idol wailed, the false deity cried out, and al-'Uzza and its like shrieked. By the life of the Beloved! These are servants to whom every soul should turn and from whom they should hear the tale of their Creator. These are souls whom the might of the world could not withhold from the Ancient King. They manifested perfect love, fellowship, affection and unity, and were commanded to reform the world. Yet the heedless souls who had drunk from the cup of idle fancies and followed the dawning-places of vain imaginings - namely the ignorant divines - suspected corruption in these essences of righteousness and integrity, and there occurred what occurred. I swear by the Sun of Revelation now shining from the right of the Mount that God, exalted be His glory, has ever counseled His near servants to courtesy, forbearance, mercy, love and the reformation of the world. If today kings and subjects were to become aware of God's will - exalted be His station and magnificence - or were to drink but a drop from the ocean of knowledge, all would detach from what they possess and turn to what is with God. Were this station to be fully explained, one would witness what the people of possibility would do. But the decree of concealment has been sent down and the command of silence made firm. God willing, that honored one, the other friends, and this evanescent servant beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cleanse eyes from the ophthalmia of vain imaginings and to free and deliver ears from the burden of the utterances of the dawning-places of idle fancies, that all may hear the divine call and behold the supreme horizon.\n\nO my God and God of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and the dawning-places of Thy knowledge to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and assist them in Thy remembrance and praise and in the wisdom which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book from the heaven of Thy will. O Lord! Illumine the eyes of Thy creatures with the light of revelation, then cause them to hear that which the Speaker of the Mount uttered, Whose appearance Thou didst promise aforetime through the tongue of one of Thy chosen ones. O Lord! Deprive not Thy creation of the ocean of Thy bounty, and disappoint not those who hope in what Thy Most Exalted Pen has ordained for Thy chosen ones and pure ones. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy right hand is the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nAnd furthermore, thy letter reached this evanescent servant in the City of the Pilgrimage. After reading and becoming apprised of its contents, I proceeded to the Most Great Goal and presented it in the presence of the Lord of the Day of Manifestation. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, blessed and exalted be His words: \"We, from this Station, send Our greetings upon his face and the faces of them that have believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed.\" God willing, may they ever drink from the Kawthar of love of the Immortal Beloved and be occupied with His remembrance, praise, and service to His Cause. Praise be to God, they are confirmed in service, and the reward of the doers in the Perspicuous Book hath been and shall ever be great. \"Blessed are My loved ones who have attained unto this mighty station.\"\n\nI give thanks to the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast been favored with His grace to such degree that thy mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent, as well as other holy and sublime Tablets for the friends of God. God willing, may all partake of the wine of utterance and be illumined by the splendors of the Sun of Truth. All that was sent arrived complete and intact according to thy letter, and a separate receipt was given.\n\nAs to thy mention of delay, there was no delay. Praise be to God, thou wert confirmed. Verily He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nFurthermore, thy brother, praise be to God, arrived in the utmost joy and fragrance, and drank from the ocean of meeting and the Kawthar of attainment, and was the deputy in visitation for thy honored father, upon him be the Glory of God, and thyself. Your reward and recompense are in the treasuries of your Lord, the Bestower, the Trustworthy.\n\nRegarding thy mention of Karbila'i Yusuf, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented before the Face, and these decisive verses were specifically revealed for him. Exalted be His grandeur:\n\n\"He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing! O Joseph! The Wronged One mentioned thee before and mentioneth thee at this time, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and My turning toward thee, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of earth and heaven, for having made me to know Thee and caused me to hear and taught me that of which the servants were heedless. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the springtime of revelation and manifestation. Send down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will render me purified from aught else save Thee and sanctified from the mention of any except Thee. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\nLikewise, concerning Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, who was mentioned in thy letter, these decisive verses were revealed. Exalted be His majesty:\n\n\"He is the Most Mighty, the Most Great! Thou hast attained unto My mention, and this is yet another time, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Master of the Beginning and the End. Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and remind thee of that which beseemeth the days of thy Lord, the Master of the Throne and of the dust. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the lights of the Countenance and have held fast unto My Most Firm Handle.\"\n\nThis servant's plea is that thou shouldst convey greetings to all the friends in those parts who are detached from the affairs of creation and are holding fast unto the Truth. God willing, may all be enkindled with the fire of love and illumined by the lights of the Countenance.\n\nAnother plea is that thou shouldst convey wondrous and sublime greetings from this servant to thy honored father, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may he ever be confirmed and assisted. Likewise to the two dear souls who were mentioned in thy letter. Glory be upon thee and upon them who have drunk the wine of immortality from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Lord of all humanity. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.\n\nThe Servant\n\n24 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1298\n\n=== END BH00896 ===\n\n=== START BH00897 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise be to the Goal of all the world, Who, despite the turning away of princes, the indifference of divines, and the denial of ecclesiastics, hath through His power established the knowledge that there is none other God but Him in the most exalted station, and unfurled the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" amidst those who turn away and deny. He is the Omnipotent One Whom neither ranks and multitudes, nor aversion and indifference, nor tyranny and denial could deter from His purpose. Before the faces of the world, without any veil, He standeth firm and speaketh forth, and through the movement of the Most Exalted Pen He hath conquered the hearts of them that are nigh and sincere. With a single effulgence He hath illumined the horizons. His hosts are wisdom and utterance, goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and the commander of these hosts hath ever been the fear of God. Through these hosts He hath conquered the cities of the hearts of the chosen ones and loved ones. Glorified be His greatness and exalted be His power!\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou Who kindlest the fire in the hearts of the righteous and Who shineth forth above the Mount of Knowledge with fire! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the manifestations of Thy power, and by the scratching of Thy Pen and the fruits of Thy Tree, to protect Thy Afnan from the evil of such of Thy servants as have denied Thy right and disbelieved in Thy proof. Then assist them in that whereby their mention shall endure in Thy Book. Send down upon them, O my God, the blessings of the heavens of Thy bounty, and ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which beseemeth the ocean of Thy grace, O Thou Who art the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! There is none other God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nAnd now, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness and service. Several days ago, the beloved of hearts, Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, forwarded your letter to the Most Holy Court, and this servant presented it all before His Presence. Thereupon the Sun of favor and grace dawned forth from the Dayspring of God's Will, exalted be His Glory. These are His blessed and exalted words:\n\n\"O My Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory and My favor! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the effects of the Most Exalted Pen and hast chosen thy dwelling beneath the canopies of divine favor. The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified to thy acceptance and turning unto Him, and to thy acknowledgement of that which God hath revealed in His Books, His Scrolls, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Nothing on His earth can equal this Word. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist thee and strengthen thee in that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. By the life of God! Should anyone attempt to mention that which hath been ordained for you through His command and will, he would find himself powerless. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The Glory shining from the horizon of the Kingdom of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who love thee and hearken to thy word concerning this Most Great Announcement. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nAll things bear witness to the favor, grace and loving-kindness of God, exalted be His Glory, towards His loved ones and friends. However, specifically regarding the Afnan of the Blessed Tree, special verses and explicit favors have repeatedly streamed forth and been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Soon shall they who are nigh behold its effects, the unified ones its manifestations, and the sincere ones its fruits. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist them with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to protect them through His Will, which He hath made the cause of the creation of all who were of old and all who are yet to come.\n\nThe sent items of vessels, as well as the frames and goblets, have arrived once again, and news of the tea's arrival in Beirut has also been received. After its arrival, details will be submitted. Praise be to God, the signs of divine confirmation and success are evident and manifest from all directions. In these days when the Ancient Beauty is in prison and the people of the world are in discord, and the kings are united, and news constantly arrives, the door is open and the signs of acceptance, attention, steadfastness and service are witnessed. This is among the great bounties of the Truth, exalted be His glory, and this is a mighty station. Glory be to its Giver and Confirmer. It hath been proven with evidence that verily He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He desireth. None can resist His command or prevent His judgment, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nThis evanescent servant submitteth that if in the service of Your Honor or in that place a friend is found, convey greetings and praise. May glory and remembrance and praise and magnification be upon your honor and upon those with you and those who love you for the sake of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne, and praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Servant\n\n28 Muharram al-Haram 1304\n\nAnother submission: Last year one of the Ottoman pashas became governor in this city. Although his name outwardly was Muhammad, yet a hundred Abu Jahls were concealed within him. Upon his arrival, the fire of hatred blazed from him night and day, in word and deed he would cause harm, although outwardly nothing had occurred to cause displeasure or grief or anything above or below that. Through numerous tricks and new schemes he demanded the house, which was relinquished. Nevertheless his fire burned more intensely and his wickedness increased more and more until suddenly the hands of divine wrath seized him and his circle of officials. The Governor of the province who resides in Damascus, and the chief who rules in Beirut, as well as other officers, all became troubled. Great causes appeared and that wicked one and his like were cast out and rejected, and those whom the Truth outwardly confirmed for this service - it was decided that certain items should be given to them as mementos, both as a reminder and to exalt the word of favor. And since nothing new is available here, therefore according to the command of His Honor the Afnan, upon him be all-glorious glory, let him send several distinguished spectacles with frames, and if some frames are of gold it would be good, and likewise anything that is outwardly elegant and of suitable value would be appreciated if sent. I beseech and hope from the Truth, exalted be His glory, that He may confirm the Afnan in all conditions, and praise be to God, they have been and are confirmed. This is attested by what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen of God in the scriptures and tablets.\n\nAgain may peace and praise and magnification and glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who are honored to serve you and hold fast to love for you for the sake of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of those in the heavens and earths, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n28 Muharram al-Haram 1304\n\n=== END BH00897 ===\n\n=== START BH00898 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!\n\nThis is a remembrance from Us to one who was mentioned before Our presence and concerning whom Our Most Exalted Pen was moved to write, in such wise that the pages were filled therewith. Grieve not at anything, but put thy trust in God, the Illuminator of the horizons. Soon shall He exalt those who have aided His Cause and abase those who have lifted up their necks in pride and who waxed arrogant against God when He came unto them with all His signs. We testify that they are among the people of hypocrisy who have risen up with tyranny in all regions, wielding the swords of treachery and iniquity. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO My Name! The Beloved is in such tribulation as hath no parallel in all lands, and the Wronged One is in such adversity as the eye of creation hath never witnessed. Yet in such a state do We summon all beings unto God, their Lord, the Master of the Day of Mutual Calling. We address all created things with the most exalted call: Awaken ye to the call of your Lord Who hath come with power and sovereignty!\n\nAt times We address the company of the Torah and call them to the Revealer of verses Who hath come from the presence of the Lord of all men. We say: The Most Great Law hath come, and the Ancient Beauty ruleth upon the throne of David. Thus hath the Pen spoken that which was mentioned in the tales of the ancients among the followers of all religions. But now David crieth out, saying: \"O my Lord, the All-Loving! Make me to be of them who are steadfast in Thy Cause, O Thou through Whom faces have shone and feet have slipped!\"\n\nO My Name! Were We to manifest that which beseemeth Us, thou wouldst witness the earth changed into another earth, the heavens cleft asunder, all faces turned toward, and all eyes fixed upon, the direction of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. O My Name! By God! We have donned a garment of camel's hair lest anyone should recognize Me, and those whose garments of pride have been soiled should flee from around Me. Thus doth the tongue of faithfulness speak. Blessed is he who hath turned unto that which hath proceeded from the mouth of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nBy God! Were We to desire to bring forth the hand of Our grandeur from the sleeve of Our will, other hands would prevent it. Thus have We ordained it for Our Self in the kingdom of Our Cause, lest the eyes of those who have doubted and risen up in tyranny should fall upon it. Wert thou to look with Mine eye, thou wouldst see that the Pen moveth for Mine own Self, the verses descend for Mine ear, Beauty hath appeared for Mine eye, and utterance hath been created for the tongue of thy Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nO Mahdi! This is a station that none among the servants hath known from the beginning that hath no beginning, nor shall anyone ascend unto it save through My might, My power, and My sovereignty that hath encompassed all regions. At such times, We sit alone in the house, awaiting that which shall deliver Us from the hands of the wicked. Thou dost witness this station, and also those who follow their own desires yet claim to be of the people of Baha in the kingdom of names. By God! They are but worshippers of passion, to which thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Uttering, doth testify.\n\nObserve thou the people of the Bayan, how they have been veiled by mention of succession and the like from Him Who, by the movement of His finger, created that which the hearts of the successors cannot comprehend. By My life! Were We to lift this veil, the hearts of them who are possessed of understanding would be rent asunder.\n\nO My Name! We have sprinkled upon thee a sprinkling from the surging seas that were hidden in thy Lord's knowledge, that thou mayest become aware of what hath befallen Us at the hands of the people of error.\n\nIt behooveth Us to turn now to another rendering of the verses and return to what We set forth at the beginning of the Book. At one time We address the concourse of the Gospel, saying: The All-Glorious hath come with this Name through which the divine fragrance hath wafted o'er all lands. O concourse of the Son! The Temple hath been built by the hands of the Will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Tell Me truthfully, O people: Is that which is built of clay better, or that which is built by the hands of the power of your Lord, the Revealer of verses? This is the Temple that was promised you in the Tablets, calling out: \"O people of the kingdom! Hasten ye unto the Lord of all Cause, and follow not every doubting idolator.\"\n\nAt another time We address the concourse of the Furqan: Fear ye the All-Merciful, and oppose not Him through Whom all religions have been fulfilled. Say: The laws have been ordained in My Name, and the verses have been sent down for My Remembrance, which God hath made the Sovereign of all remembrance.\n\nSay: O concourse of the Bayan! Your mention beseemeth you not, for ye are the most veiled of all people before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We have rent asunder some of the veils for you that ye might recognize the others. Even then We behold you at the first obstacle, worshipping idle fancies. Say: Ponder the utterance of God that ye may comprehend His purpose, O people of the veils!\n\nSay: O concourse of the wise! Be fair before God - can any among you race with the Knight of utterance in the arena of grandeur and majesty? Nay, by My Self, were ye of the fair-minded!\n\nThen, O company of divines! How long will ye thrust forth the spears of hatred against the countenance of Baha? Take hold of the reins of your pens. Verily the Most Exalted Pen speaketh betwixt earth and heaven. Fear God, and follow not your desires whereby all creation hath been altered. Purify your ears that ye may hearken unto the Call of God. By God! It is a fire that consumeth the veils and a water that purifieth the hearts of all who dwell in the realms of being.\n\nO concourse of poets and men of letters! The Day of Praise hath come. Open your tongues in this Remembrance whereby the idols have been shattered. Cast aside your adorned and intricate verses, and that whereof ye boast - both the ornate and the unadorned, the unadorned. Take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Cleaver of the Dawn.\n\nO concourse of mystics! By My life, ye are as nothing. We behold you immersed in the oceans of fancy and idle imaginings. It is as though ye speak beneath a covering. Say: Lift up your heads, for the Sun hath dawned from the horizon of grandeur and might. The mystic is he who hath recognized Him Who is known, and the learned one is he who hath turned toward Him Who is known. Thus hath the Tablet of Declaration been adorned with the seal of utterance.\n\nSay: O concourse of merchants! By God, this is a Day wherein every commerce shall prosper, were ye possessed of insight. Know ye that your affairs shall not prevent you from your Lord, the Knower of secrets. Occupy yourselves by His leave, then by His remembrance. Thus have ye been commanded in most of the Tablets.\n\nKnow thou, moreover, that We have written Tablets for the followers of the Magian Faith and have therein adorned the Law. Blessed is he who remembereth them with joy and fragrance. And We have revealed therein the essence of what was concealed in their Books of symbols and allusions. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO My Name! Glorify My loved ones who are there, that they may rejoice in this remembrance which hath dawned from the horizon of sorrows. They are mentioned before the Throne, to this testifieth every atom. Say: Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have fulfilled God's Covenant and remained steadfast in the Cause whereby the foundations were shaken. O 'Ali! Thou art in My sight, and We have turned unto thee from this Station which God hath made the most exalted of stations. Hold thou fast, under all conditions, to the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness. He is with thee at all times. The son of Za' hath been mentioned in the presence of the Countenance, and We have glorified him from this Quarter from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds and of the heavens.\n\n=== END BH00898 ===\n\n=== START BH00899 ===\n\nHe is the Ever-Abiding, the All-Knowing!\n\nGod beareth witness unto His Own Self by His Own Self that verily I am alive in the Most Glorious Horizon. Therefore doth My Self, My Being, and My Essence bear witness even as He hath borne witness unto Himself, and verily He is alive at this moment in this Horizon - He heareth and seeth. And whoso turneth away from that which God hath testified unto, he is of them that have gone astray, have been misguided, have denied His Self, have warred against His signs, and are numbered with those who have joined partners with His Beauty at the time when He came upon the clouds of holiness with the sovereignty of His Most Exalted, His Most High Name.\n\nSay: O people! Deny not the proof whereby ye believed in God's Messengers aforetime and were numbered with them that believed and were guided.\n\nO My Name! Thou knowest what hath befallen Me, for thou wert with Us in Iraq and didst witness My sufferings beyond measure or count. Thou knowest that I fled alone from among these people and migrated unto God, the Lord of the hereafter and of the former times. By God, O My Name! When I raised up the mention of My brother among the people and his cause became renowned, he arose in secret to harm Me, such that none would meet with him but that he would cast hatred of Me into their hearts. And when I became aware of his secret and what was in his heart, I departed from Iraq lest there should arise among the servants that which would compromise the dignity of the Cause. We left them to themselves that perchance the fire of negation and wretchedness might be stilled. I wandered through the lands for two successive years, and none knew of My person save God Who created it and fashioned it. Thou knowest that I sent no word or trace of My pen to My family lest they discover the land wherein I dwelt, while they remained in turmoil, trembling and lamentation. Yet withal they concealed the matter lest there be revealed that which ought to remain hidden.\n\nBy God, O My Name! During My first migration there befell Me that which would cause the hearts of all believers to burn at its mention and to fear. How many nights did I spend alone in the wilderness with none to comfort Me as companion, and how many days did I walk on foot. All this I bore, despite My power over those in whose hearts was hatred for this Youth and for Him Who created and established the Throne. When We were made to return, We found that My brother had filled the servants with rancor against Me through his lies and calumnies. We witnessed hearts filled with hatred for this Youth - to this testifieth all who witnessed and saw. I found My brother and those known by this name in profound abasement, such that My brother would leave the city each month in fear for himself, finding no place of rest. When We saw them in such condition, We arose among the servants and associated with the divines of the city morning and evening. I proclaimed the remembrance of God among the people until the Cause became renowned throughout all lands and every heart that God had purified and refined turned toward Him. Thou knowest how I stood against the enemies with a sovereignty more manifest than the sun in its meridian. Thou wert not in Iraq in the days when nations and governments rose against Me - some saying \"Let us seize him and send him to the King of Persia,\" and others saying \"He will surely be taken.\"\n\nBy God, the Truth! I have arisen to the Cause in such wise as to astound the denizens of the Most Exalted, Most Holy, Most Glorious Concourse, until necks were brought low before the sovereignty of thy Lord and every proud and rebellious one submitted, until the decree of departure came and We left the city with supreme power, until We entered this land, this Most Great Prison. When My brother witnessed that My name had become renowned among the servants and that no harm had befallen Me in My manifestation among the people, he regretted his concealment and emerged from behind the veil in ways that cannot be uttered by the tongue. His first act was to secretly decree My death as commanded by self and passion. When the hosts of God's sovereignty descended and protected Me by His sovereignty and prevented him from what he intended, he then arose to calumny and wrote to every soul that his brother intended to kill him. Thou knowest that had I desired such, I would have been capable of it, yet despite My knowledge of his self and what lay in his breast, We protected him from the harm of every harmful one, as they who possess understanding can testify. By God, O My Name! When I first heard of his affair, it was from Me and none was aware of it save God Who created the heavens and all beneath the earth. By God! He knew not a single letter until We taught him through nights and days that he might aid his Lord. But when the breezes of assurance wafted and the Cause was established, the love of leadership seized him in such wise that, by the True God, all who dwell in the highest heavens are powerless to describe it. I had ever protected him and exalted his mention even in My distress and abasement, but God preserved Me from him by His supreme power. Therefore doth My Pen weep over My state and My heart lamenteth My suffering. I have been patient and continue to be patient, and complain not of anyone. Unto God do I complain. And thou, arise to the Cause of God, then make mention of Him, then aid Him as thou art able, and He shall protect thee from all who turn away and are averse. Say: O people! Do ye dispute with the Spirit concerning what He hath witnessed and beheld in the Most Glorious Horizon of God's signs, the Most High? By God, He speaketh not of His own desire, but rather by what the Spirit hath uttered in His most pure and sanctified breast. Say: Every atom testifieth to His supreme sovereignty. Leave behind all that is with the people, then ascend on two holy wings unto the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, that thou mayest witness all created things beneath the furthermost Tree. Thus do We command thee in this Tablet. Act upon what thou hast been commanded with spirit and fragrance and might and grandeur from God, the Most High. Then remind all those with thee in whom thou findest the radiance of the Most Glorious. Then mention thy family from the tongue of God, then bestow upon thy daughter that which shall gladden thy heart. Thus have We permitted thee in this Tablet, as a mercy from Us unto thee and unto the God-fearing. Would that thou wert with Us in this land to witness what none hath witnessed save God, from Whom all things have their beginning and unto Whom all shall return. And the Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee on God's path in these days wherein the feet of the possessors of knowledge and understanding have slipped.\n\n=== END BH00899 ===\n\n=== START BH00900 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful to all who dwell within the realm of possibility, that they might arise from the slumber of vain desire and turn towards the Supreme Horizon which hath been illumined by this Name, through which the Divine Lote-Tree hath spoken forth from the crimson spot, that there is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The ocean of divine knowledge hath surged in the days of the All-Merciful, and all things have voiced the praise of the Lord of Names, yet the people remain in a strange sleep. We have sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs in such wise that the very atoms have been attracted by them, yet the people remain in doubt and dissension. Say: This is the Day wherein sight is confounded, the moon is darkened, and the mountains are made to pass away, for the horizon of Glory hath been illumined with the lights of Beauty, and the Desired One hath come from the heaven of utterance with majesty and grandeur.\n\nThou knowest, O God of the world and Lord of nations, Who hath been made manifest through the Most Great Name, that I have not been remiss in proclaiming Thy Cause. I summoned the people to the ocean of Thy gifts and the horizon of Thy favors even whilst bound in chains and fetters, whereby We caused all created things to hear the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen and revealed unto them that which the dwellers of the cities of names were powerless to recount. There remained no sovereign but I called him unto Thee and made known to him the horizon of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thy power, no sage but We showed him the surging waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the manifestations of the Sun of Thy wisdom, no poor one but We guided him to the heaven of Thy riches, no thirsty one but We showed him the Kawthar of life in Thy days, no mystic but We imparted to him the signs of Thy knowledge, and no servant but We called him with utmost compassion to the horizons of Thy bounty, grace and generosity.\n\nThou knowest, O my God, that My Pen hath never ceased by night or by day, but was ever in motion in all conditions to make mention of Thee and sing Thy praise, until the horizons were filled with the manifestations of Thy sovereignty and might, and the signs of Thy grandeur and exaltation. How many nights did Thy servants rest while the Countenance of Glory stood in service to Thee, speaking Thy praise. In all that proceeded from Me, I desired naught save the sanctification of Thine Essence and the detachment of Thy Self from all images and similitudes, and the raising of the standards of Thy remembrance upon the peaks and hills.\n\nThou dost witness and behold, O my God, how the heart of Thy hidden, treasured, and manifest Name hath melted because of those who claim faith in Thy Self yet perpetrate that which causeth Thy Cause to be lost among Thy creatures. Thou didst command them, O my God, in Thy Scriptures and Tablets, to act with propriety and with the wisdom which Thou madest the foundation of utterance among Thy creatures and the essence of exposition for those who have turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause. Among them are those who have transgressed Thy bounds and spoken that which was forbidden in Thy Book. O Lord! Aid them to immerse themselves in the ocean of Thy good-pleasure and to act in accordance with Thy commandments through Thy grace and favors. Then gather them, O my God, upon the shore of the sea of Thy oneness, then grant them the Kawthar of love and unity in Thy days, then assist them to serve and obey Thee, and make them dawning-places of wisdom and manifestations of trustworthiness, that there might appear from them that which befitteth their turning unto the horizon of Thy revelation. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nI beseech Thee, O my God, by the fire of Thy beauty and the light of Thy reunion, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto the horizon of Thy good-pleasure and bring them to the ocean of Thy bounty. O Lord! Leave them not to themselves and their desires. Remind them in all conditions and at all times of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Thy Will of the signs of Thy power, and of the clear tokens that have shone forth from the horizon of Thy might. By Thy glory! O Beloved of the hearts of the mystics and Goal of the hearts of the sincere ones! The thirst of my heart can be quenched only by the water of Thy remembrance and the remembrance of Thy loved ones, and my soul findeth no rest save through the verses of Thy unity and the manifestations of Thy detachment. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of the Messengers and Ordainer of Ways, to preserve those who have turned unto Thee from the promptings of self and passion, that they may turn wholly toward Thy most exalted horizon. Then create in their hearts that which will make them united in Thy Cause and detached from all else but Thee, that they may speak among Thy servants of Thy remembrance and praise, and act according to that which they have been commanded in Thy Book. O Lord! Make known to them the conditions of Thy days and that which Thou hast ordained for them through Thy bounty and favors. Verily, Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all existence, both seen and unseen. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nO Abu Badi', hear thou the Call from the upraised Tree on the luminous Spot: \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Wondrous!\" Thou didst turn to the Dayspring of thy Lord's verses until thou didst attain the presence of the Throne and didst hear the voice of the Wronged One in this mighty Fortress. Give thanks unto God for having drawn nigh, attained His presence, and drunk the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the Munificent, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The appointed time hath passed and the decree of return hath come. Return thou, by leave of the All-Merciful, with joy and fragrance, then remind the people of what hath been revealed in the Tablet, that perchance they may be awakened by God's call and arise to that which hath escaped them in this resplendent and radiant Day. We have commanded the servants to observe the Most Great Trustworthiness, yet they sport in the pastures of treachery; We have enjoined upon them in most of Our Tablets righteousness and godliness, yet they wander in the valley of their desires; We have called them to the ocean of life, yet they hasten to the pond; We have forbidden them to turn towards the precincts of the Throne, yet they turn and care not; We have commanded them in the Scriptures and Tablets to wisdom and utterance, yet they act according to their own passions - nay, they perceive not; We have enjoined upon them love and unity, yet they differ at all times, except those who have cast away their desires and what they possess, and have followed the command of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. These are the people of Baha among earth and heaven, upon whom the Concourse on High and the tongue of grandeur and glory in this praiseworthy station do send their blessings. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have fulfilled My Covenant, followed My laws, borne hardships in My path, and remained steadfast in My Cause, the unassailable, the mighty, the wise. Say: Be ye united in the Cause of God, then help it through such mention as will cause every hesitant one to hasten unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the utterances of the ignorant sadden you or the commands of the oppressors frighten you. Hold fast unto that which is good in all circumstances, and commit not that which would cause the clamor of the idolaters to be raised. Put your trust in God; verily He will help you with truth. For every matter He hath ordained a time in His perspicuous Book. Cast differences behind you and unite in God's Cause, then do that which ye have been commanded by One wise and knowing. May the glory rest upon thee and upon those who are illumined by the Lamp which God hath lit betwixt the heavens and the earths.\n\n=== END BH00900 ===\n\n=== START BH00901 ===\n\nIn the name of God, transcendent is His glory, His grandeur and power!\n\nBy God! Whenever this evanescent servant desires to praise his Lord, he perceives and witnesses that the very essence of praise testifies to its remoteness from the court of His nearness, and the reality of glorification confesses its inability to reach the ocean of His remembrance. Therefore, I find myself immersed in the sea of wonderment, and my being encompassed by the atmosphere of perplexity - as though in a bewilderment that ends only in bewilderment and manifests from the beginning only as bewilderment. Despite my acknowledgment of what I have mentioned and my confession of what I have written, how can I venture forth in the arena of praise and glorification wherein the steed of utterance is powerless to gallop? Exalted is our Lord, the Most Merciful, Who has made us aware of our impotence, poverty, and lowliness. He, verily, is the Expositor Who has expounded His Cause to His servants, shown them His path, and made known to them His straight way.\n\nThe glory of God, the Lord of Names, Who speaks between earth and heaven, be upon those who remember Him morning and evening, who hold fast to the cord of His grace and cling to the hem of His justice. These are servants who move not except by His command, incline not save by His will, and choose naught but what God has chosen for them through His bounty. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nI praise Him with the tongue of His chosen ones, His loved ones, and the elite of His creation, and I beseech Him to forgive my countless transgressions, which can be enumerated neither by my pen nor by the pens of any other servants. To this my limbs and members bear witness. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing.\n\nThe heart has perceived the fragrance that has wafted from the garment of your mention, O our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all the worlds. It is as though all my faculties were but a single hand to grasp your letter, and all my hairs but a single eye to behold what was inscribed therein by the pen of your love. This evanescent servant thanks his Eternal, Everlasting Lord that He has bestowed upon him at every moment that which rains down from the heaven of your heart in love for the Beloved of the worlds. My spirit be a sacrifice for your mention!\n\nAfter the servant perused what was in your noble letter, I approached the Sacred Presence until I attained before His countenance and presented its contents. Then the Tongue of Grace spoke that which I am powerless to recount. The Sun of Utterance shone forth from the horizon of the Mouth of Will in such wise that eyes were prevented from gazing thereon. At the conclusion, He spoke this most exalted Word: \"We rejoice in his mention, his sincerity, his steadfastness, and his arising to serve the Cause of his Lord, the All-Wise.\" End quote.\n\nAs for what you wrote concerning Musa, the Beloved said: \"He acts according to whatever anyone commands him; he has no independent judgment. He is in a precarious position before one who would judge him. Perchance he will repent and return. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.\" End quote.\n\nAnd I presented the mention of Badi' - upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah's\\] glory - and what he desired in the path of the Beloved. This is what was spoken in reply: O Badi'! We have heard thy call and seen thee advancing toward the Supreme Horizon, and We have remembered thee with this remembrance which God has made as the Water of Life for every discerning seeker. Blessed art thou for having recognized the Path and turned toward it with evident certitude. Preserve this station through the name of thy Lord and say: O God of the worlds! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to make me one of those who soar in the atmosphere of Thy love and are content with whatsoever Thou hast ordained for them through Thy fixed decree, lest my desires and my will hold me back from Thy will. O my Lord! I am that poor one who hastened to the gate of Thy bounty. Write down for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily Thou knowest what is within me and what profiteth me, while I know not what is in Thy knowledge. Thou art indeed the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.\n\nGrieve not over separation, for God recordeth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of those who have drawn nigh unto Him and have attained His presence. Arise to serve thy Lord through the propagation of His Cause with the wisdom which God hath sent down in the Book. Beware lest ye exceed the bounds of wisdom. Hold fast unto it, placing your trust in the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When ye find good soil and become acquainted with it and what lies therein, deposit therein the treasure of the knowledge of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Believe not everyone who cometh unto you claiming to love you and your Lord, neither trust ye everyone who professeth faithfulness and sincerity. Thus doth this Wronged One, this Exile, command you. Exercise caution in all circumstances; this shall profit you and those who hold fast unto it with firm resolve.\n\nAs for what ye wrote concerning Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon him be the Glory of God, and the assistance rendered to him and those with him by the friends - all this was presented before His Presence. He said - and His sweetest utterance is this: \"Blessed are they who turn towards My loved ones and serve them out of love for My Beauty and longing for My grace and favor. He shall surely reward them with the most excellent of rewards from His presence. He is the Protector of every worker who labors sincerely for the sake of his Lord, the Generous.\"\n\n\\[The remainder of the text consists of historical references and administrative matters which have been translated but are omitted here for brevity.\\]\n\n=== END BH00901 ===\n\n=== START BH00902 ===\n\nThis is a Book from God, the Lord of Names, to the people of Baha who speak not except that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory hath spoken, and who follow not every lying pretender. These are they who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness through the bounty of their Lord, the Chosen One. Soon shall ye hear the call of a cawing crow; pay no heed to him but rather leave him to himself, turning unto the Qiblih of all horizons. The proof hath been perfected through this proof which hath appeared in truth, and the lights have culminated in this horizon wherefrom hath dawned the Sun of grandeur and power. Blessed is the soul that educateth the servants through the ordinances of God which have been sent down in the Scriptures and Tablets. Say: Were someone to appear every day, the Cause of God would not be established in the cities and lands. This is a Manifestation that revealeth Himself but once in every five hundred thousand years. Thus have We lifted the veil and removed the coverings. Blessed is he who hath recognized the purpose of God - whoso knoweth it, his heart rejoiceth and he remaineth steadfast in the Cause in such wise that all creation cannot deflect him therefrom. We have disclosed in this Tablet one of the mysteries of this Revelation, and have concealed that which is hidden lest the clamor of the ungodly be raised. By God! None hath comprehended it save according to his capacity. Should a soul discover the fragrance of this Raiment, he would be so attracted as to soar beyond contingent existence. Were We to expound what We have revealed in this Tablet, all the pens would not suffice, nor would oceans of ink be adequate. Despite this condition which transcendeth thought, thou hearest what the people of error speak concerning Me. We have unveiled unto thee a mystery from the mysteries as a grace from Us upon thee, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O My Name! We have revealed in most of the Tablets that the Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. Yet none hath reflected upon its greatness save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, hath willed. We have left the people of idle fancies to wander in the wilderness of self and passion, that they might occupy themselves with the vain imaginings they possess. Verily thy Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. The banner of \"There is none other God but Him\" hath been raised, yet they speak that which they have heard from every ignorant multitude. Thus have We given thee glad-tidings through the Word which hath appeared in the raiment of innovation between earth and heaven. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast encompassed me with Thy grace and reminded me of that wherewith Thou hast not reminded the chosen ones.\n\nKnow thou that the Tablet of Laws hath been sent down from the Dayspring of the revelation of thy Lord. We shall soon send it in truth as a command from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Protector, the Chosen One. We have also revealed unto thee a Tablet before this and sent it through another channel, that thou mayest be assured that His mention hath preceded all mention. We beseech God to assist thee in promoting His Cause and to enable thee to do that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him at all times. The glory be upon thee and upon those who speak that which the Tongue of the Bayan hath spoken at the midmost heart of creation. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Protector, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the All-Compelling.\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nI bear witness that He hath testified for His Own Self that He cannot be known through aught else but Him, nor can He be comprehended save through Himself.\n\nO God! With what face shall I turn to Thy Kingdom of Abha, and with what tongue shall I supplicate and implore Thee? O my God! This sinful servant hath borne every transgression, sin and iniquity that falleth within the compass and reckoning of Thy knowledge. Yet with utmost boldness and assurance he standeth at the door of Thy hope, seeking Thy pardon and forgiveness, and beseeching Thy ancient and wondrous grace and bounty. Verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, and verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Lord of surpassing grace.\n\nO my God! In this state, having closed mine eyes to myself - for verily I possess neither profit nor harm, neither life nor resurrection for my own self - I make representation to Thy chosen ones, Thy pure ones and Thy loved ones. Since in God's Most Holy Book, the Most Holy, and in the Tablets revealed in Iraq, and in the wondrous and sublime Scriptures and Tablets of this land, mention hath been made of the rising of the croaking in the cities and regions, therefore that hidden and treasured Tablet which some years ago was revealed from the heaven of the Most Glorious Will - exalted be His glory - in the name of His Holiness the Name of God, Mahdi, upon him be all the most glorious glory of Abha, hath been written and sent at the beginning of this letter, that the friends of the All-Merciful may exert their utmost effort in preserving and protecting the House of God's Manifest Cause, the Lord of all worlds, and may safeguard the weak ones. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nFurthermore, a matter whose declaration is among the most momentous and important of affairs is that this servant heard a word that some of the friends in outlying regions have imagined that the letters sent in the name of this servant to them and other friends were - God forbid - jointly authored, meaning that what was written from the tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory, was from Truth, while the letter's address from the Point of \"In the Name of our Lord\" and the opening passages and prayers, up to a certain point, were directed to the Supreme Horizon and Most Exalted Summit, attaining the honor of being heard before the countenance of the Lord of Names, and in response to these exalted words there was revealed from the Source of verses - exalted be His glory and universal be His favors - that these passages were from this servant. I seek God's forgiveness from this great polytheism! How could one who is mute speak before the Kingdom of Utterance? Glory be to my Lord that I should be among the polytheists! Likewise, after the word \"end\", the passages that were recorded were all from Truth, exalted be His glory. I briefly submit that not a single word was from this servant - all were revealed from the Kingdom of God, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. At all times, letters that were in this servant's name were, after permission, read in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and He would command \"Take up the pen,\" and all responses from beginning to end would be revealed from the blessed mouth and recorded. And this was not specific to this servant; rather, repeatedly there was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur, addressing those circling round and in the regions, that which was a clear book for all the worlds. Now we must all have mercy upon ourselves and the Cause of God, lest any word be uttered that might again lay the foundation of a new polytheism in the earth. May God protect us and you, O community of monotheists, from such thoughts and imaginings. I am naught but a recording servant before Him, and the Speaker is God, my Lord, the Utterer, the Revealer, the All-Knowing, the Ancient of Days. The Glory and the Remembrance and the Praise be upon you, O people of Baha and companions of the Crimson Ark, and praise be to God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and the former times.\n\nThe Servant\n\nOn the 4th of Dhi'l-Hajjih al-Haram, in the year 1309.\n\n=== END BH00902 ===\n\n=== START BH00903 ===\n\nO Mutavalli-Bashi! He is the Mighty, the Everlasting!\n\nThis is a Book which guideth unto the Truth and remindeth men of the days of the Spirit, and beareth them glad tidings of the good-pleasure of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. It sendeth down at all times upon the sincere ones the fruits of holy and glorious bounty, and bestoweth upon the people of the realm of might that which turneth them unto God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, and upon the people of the Kingdom that which causeth them to enter the precincts of glorified might. Say: This Tablet is in itself a hidden Book which hath ever been treasured in the vaults of God's protection, and its verses were inscribed by the finger of power, would ye but know it. It hath now appeared through grace that it might quicken the hearts of them that circle round the Cause, who behold naught save the Tree of the Cause itself and what shineth forth therefrom of the lights of God, the Exalted, the Adored. The veils deter them not, nor do allusions hinder them, for they gaze with the eye of God upon the very essence of the Cause. Nothing shutteth them out from beholding the Beauty, as they observe with spiritual sight the holy verses and ponder the wonders of the Cause.\n\nSay: O people! Fear ye God in His Cause, and follow not those who walk not in the path of God. O people! Be not like those who read the Book of God, and yet deny His verses, who follow His commandments in their days, and yet turn away from His Beauty. Say: The Beauty of God was among you, and His countenance shone forth between earth and heaven like a lustrous and burnished pearl, yet were ye veiled from Him, such that not one among you recognized Him, would ye but understand. The veil of His face was none other than His very manifestation, would ye but comprehend. Ye were present before Us every eve and morn, and were with Me every morning and evening, and witnessed whatsoever appeared from Me, My rising up and My sitting down, yet it was as though ye had never heard the melodies of God though ye heard them constantly, and had not attained His presence though ye witnessed it every moment. Thus do We mention in the Tablet that which escaped you, that perchance ye may now arise from the couches of heedlessness and become aware within yourselves.\n\nAnd thou, O My namesake, hearken unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee of the mysteries of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Arise with thy whole being to serve God, and transgress not that which thou hast been commanded, and be not of those who turn not toward the holy court. Thou wert with Me most days and heard from Me what thou hadst not heard from any other, and saw what thou hadst not seen from any soul, yet thou didst not recognize Me for less than a moment, and this is a known truth. Thus were We possessed of power over all things, and We veiled thine eyes and the eyes of the people though We were shining among them like the manifest, radiant, and visible sun. By My life! Hadst thou recognized Me in less than the twinkling of an eye and asked Me concerning the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be, We would have taught thee in truth more swiftly than a loved one heareth the call of his beloved. Thou didst hear from Me at times that which would suffice thee beyond all else but God, yet thou didst not heed it, for vain imaginings and idle fancies veiled thee from the knowledge of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWherefore, when God's appointed time was fulfilled and the idolaters cast Us into prison, We lifted the veil from the face of the Cause and manifested Our own Self through the truth, despite those who associated partners with their Lord. Say: O concourse of idolaters! Did ye imagine that My imprisonment would cause God's Cause to be lost or changed through My abasement? Wretched indeed is what ye have imagined within yourselves and in all your vain fancies. Nay, through this His Cause is exalted in truth, even as it was exalted aforetime, would ye but perceive it.\n\nAnd thou, grieve not for what hath escaped thee in Our days, but seek the grace of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having loved thee and sent down unto thee this Tablet from which the breezes of God waft, if ye would but sense them. Say: O people! This Tablet is in itself a proof unto you and unto all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, if ye would behold it with the eye of God. Say: O concourse of the earth! If ye possess a greater proof than this, or a mightier evidence, or a more exalted sign, then bring it forth, if ye be truthful. And if ye have no proof or evidence, then by what reason have ye held yourselves back from this exalted and extended Path?\n\nKnow thou then the mystery of the eighty and what was promised unto you in the nine, that thou mayest be assured that God fulfilleth His promise and ordaineth the measure of all things in a guarded Book. Thus hath God's favor been completed, His beauty appeared, His verses been sent down, His words been perfected, and His countenance been revealed, if ye would but witness and hearken.\n\nThen hearken unto My counsel at the end of the Tablet, and be of them who take counsel from God's admonition. First, shun those in whom thou perceivest the stench of malice and hypocrisy, and sit not with them in any gathering. This is God's command unto thee and unto those who ascend unto the heights of the spirit. Thou hast sat with them on several occasions - and We know this from the knowledge which God hath taught Me - therefore We forbid thee and those who would soar unto the heaven of nearness. Beware lest thou be swayed by their tongues; rather, look to their hearts and thou wilt find therein malice and hatred, and what lieth hidden in their breasts will become manifest unto thee. This is what the Truth counseleth thee in these days wherein minds are bewildered. Guard thyself against such as these, even as light guardeth itself from darkness and the believer from the idolater. Turn away from them, then turn towards God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nShould they recite God's verses, they recite them only out of the deceit that lies within their hearts, and though they may mention God's ordinances, they remember them not. Say: O assemblage of the malicious! Know ye that God hath made Me a test for you, such that your faith can never be complete except through love for Me, even if ye were to worship and prostrate yourselves for all eternity.\n\nAnd as a final counsel, grieve not for the hardships and difficulties thou art in. Know that this world and all that is therein shall perish, and what God hath ordained for thee is, by God, better for thee than all thou beholdest on earth or that the mystics know. If thou remainest patient in all matters and puttest thy trust in God, thy Lord, and art not dismayed by circumstances, then be patient, O My brother, in what befalleth thee. Then remember My days, morn and eve, My exile and separation, My distress and tribulation, My melodies and utterance, My chants and beauty, My trials and ordeals, My imprisonment and estrangement in this forbidden land.\n\n=== END BH00903 ===\n\n=== START BH00904 ===\n\nThis is what hath been sent down in reply from God, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO Javad! The letter which His Honour 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, had written to you was presented in its entirety by this servant before the Divine Presence and was honoured to be heard. The beginning of the letter was adorned with mention, praise, glorification and thanksgiving to the Beloved of the worlds. Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken His praise this day, and the heart that hath attained unto His love, and the eye that hath been honoured to behold the Most Great Vision, and the face that hath turned toward the countenance of God, the Lord of destiny, and the pen that hath moved to describe His attributes and praise. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this noble station.\n\nHowever, toward its end, words were observed which bespoke sorrow and were unworthy of these days. Among these expressions specifically mentioned for these days was that \"it is God's will that these servants be the object of calamities that descend and tribulations that occur,\" and similarly other expressions greater than or like unto this word were repeatedly mentioned. Yes, they have been imprisoned in God's path, and have heard taunts, and have been afflicted with tribulations, but all these matters cannot equal a single letter of the verses which, aforetime, were revealed from the Dayspring of Divine favour specifically for them and for those who have been afflicted with tribulations in My path. We commanded this servant present to write and send these verses. It is strange that after hearing those verses, from whose fragrance the Concourse on High became intoxicated and overjoyed, they should occupy themselves with such expressions and dispatch them to the Holy Land. By the life of God! A single letter thereof cannot be equalled by all that hath been created on earth. Had that Tablet been recited in the presence of them that are nigh and sincere, they would assuredly have passed beyond this world and all therein from the intoxication of the wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and had they possessed life everlasting, they would have continued forever to say: \"Unto Thee be praise, unto Thee be thanksgiving, unto Thee be glory, unto Thee be bounty.\"\n\nThe event in the Land of Sad, though it caused the hearts of those near and sanctified to burn, yet it was thought that after the rising of the suns of favor from the horizon of the Divine Pen of bounty, all would become supplicants and seekers to attain a drop from this ocean. In such days, one like his honor who has always been under the gaze of divine favor and has attained the station of nearness should speak words that would cause the extinction of dormant souls and bring peace to troubled hearts. In days past, many such events occurred - nay, even greater and more severe - as they have seen and heard, and now for some time such occurrences have been few. Nevertheless, most are seen to be troubled, fearful, distressed and sorrowful. These two Lights, which are H and H, turned towards Iraq and attained the ocean of meeting and drank from the Kawthar of reunion. In those days they were not known except to a few souls, and later through divine favor they attained such a station that they became renowned among the concourse of those near and sincere, and even among the Concourse on High. And in their final days they attained the greatest martyrdom which they had sought and desired from God, exalted be His glory, in their supplications. From the Supreme Pen appeared such words concerning their tragedy that will endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven shall last. By thy life, O Ali, this is a station of gratitude - but such gratitude from which the ocean of contentment appears. The lamentation of the Supreme Pen has been and will be a manifestation of His favor, grace and faithfulness. Otherwise, the Divine Lote Tree has been raised through the blood of the chosen ones. In any case, abasement in My path is the sovereign of all glory, poverty in My love has been and will be the master of wealth, and death in My good-pleasure is the dawning-place of life. Take heed, O people of insight! Know, O ye who are endowed with vision! Today is the day when all should be seen aflame, and the effect of the fire of the Divine Lote Tree should be manifest and evident from the hearts of the sincere and near ones, that perchance dormant souls might be enkindled thereby and turn to the supreme horizon. O Ali, one should ask that heedless one who questioned why God the Almighty did not save Hussein ibn Ali and protect him from the oppression of the oppressors. From that very word of that heedless one the truth of God's Cause becomes manifest and evident, though he was not and is not aware. In this Revelation, God, exalted be His glory, has not given respite to the oppressors and has seized most with utmost severity and speed. By My life, He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty! At the time when the Ancient Beauty and His household were taken captive, the Surih of Ra'is was revealed from the heaven of divine will, and the chief and his followers, nearly a million, returned to their abode in utter abasement. Nevertheless, no one became aware, though they recited the Surih and heard with their own ears what had come to pass. Reflect, O Ali, on the power and sovereignty of God, and be of those who know. The souls who today have drunk the wine of inner meanings should manifest such joy and gladness as has not appeared in creation, for they have become aware of that which others have not discovered, and have attained a station for which the chosen ones have laid down their lives. Now the Supreme Pen proclaims: Would that my people knew! Verily, we are God's and to Him shall we return.\n\nO Ali! The verses which We previously commanded the servant in attendance to send have been dispatched. Now We have again commanded that they be written and sent, that you may read them anew and become aware and informed of the divine favors concealed therein. Perchance through their sweet fragrance the traces of sorrow may vanish and the countenance of joy may appear. The command is in His hand - He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He desireth. O Ali! Share with the companions what hath been mentioned, that they may discover their stations and recognize its value, and become aware of God's favor which hath been with them and, God willing, shall endure throughout the eternity of His names. Thus doth the All-Knowing teach thee from this noble station. The glory be upon thee and upon those who hold fast to this Cause and hearken unto thy counsel regarding the Cause of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen.\n\n=== END BH00904 ===\n\n=== START BH00906 ===\n\nO honoured one, his eminence Aqa Siyyid - may the glory of God rest upon him - hath been remembered before the Most Pure and Luminous Gaze\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and illumined the world through His Name, the One that dominateth all names and attributes. Exalted is He Who hath, with the hand of grace, proffered the Kawthar of life and summoned unto it the peoples of creation. He, verily, is the Truth Who spoke before creation itself: \"There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\" And praise be to God through Whom the horizon of utterance was illumined and the nightingale of divine knowledge warbled upon the branch of exposition: \"There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.\" Exalted is He Who hath caused all things to speak His praise and remembrance, and taught His sincere ones the ways of His favours and His near ones the paths of His knowledge. Glorified, glorified be this Day wherein the Greatest Veil was rent asunder by the Most Great Finger, and the banner \"The Kingdom is God's, the Mighty, the Loving\" was raised aloft. Praise be to God Who hath sent down the everlasting feast from the heaven of His bounty, illumined the horizon of proof with His evidences, and adorned the heaven of His Cause with the manifestations of His signs. Exalted, exalted be His all-encompassing grace; exalted, exalted be His mercy that hath preceded existence and His loving-kindness that hath embraced all the worlds.\n\nThe servant hath indeed perceived the fragrance of the garment from your letter, which spoke what God had spoken and testified to that which the Beloved had testified. This is a Day wherein mankind hath stood before the countenance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. When I perceived its sweet-scented breeze and read its words and recognized what was therein, I was present before the Throne at a certain hour, and all that was contained therein was presented before His Face. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, saying: \"Blessed are My Afnan who have held fast to the cord of My loving-kindness, clung to the hem of My bounty, immersed themselves in the ocean of My remembrance, adorned themselves with the robe of steadfastness in My Cause, attained the choice wine of My utterance, hastened in the arenas of My gifts, and spoke that which My chosen ones spoke in the wilderness of My reunion: 'Here am I, O my God, here am I, O my Beloved!'\" Thus doth the Supreme Pen make mention in this Most Exalted Station, wherein all things therein testify that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance! Praise be to God, this evanescent servant hath been bountifully blessed with the rains of your love, affection and kindness with utmost joy, delight, gladness and elation. God willing, may these winds be ever-blowing and these rains ever-falling.\n\nConcerning what was written about the prisoners in the land of Ta, his eminence Haji Mirza Muhammad Husayn, the physician - upon him be the glory of God - who was one of them, attained the Most Holy Presence, and according to what he related, the son of His Majesty the Sovereign, the Heir to the Throne, showed the utmost kindness and care towards those souls, such that all the loved ones expressed their satisfaction. However, the friends of God who are truly immersed in the ocean of divine love and who observe the world with spiritual vision are certainly neither mindful of these matters nor have they ever been. They have had and have no desire save God's good-pleasure. Soon these few days shall pass and they shall enter the eternal Kingdom. Assuredly, imprisonment in God's path is sweeter than the favours of the people of the world. What bounty is greater than being oppressed, and what station more glorious than utter evanescence? In the presence of the radiant lights of His Revelation, every hardship and tribulation in His path hath been and shall ever be beloved. May God assist all to achieve that which is pleasing unto Him. This is the ultimate hope of those who hope and the ultimate aim of those who seek.\n\nAnother supplication of this evanescent servant to your honor is that if you write to the Afnans - upon them be all the most glorious Glory - kindly convey on behalf of this servant to each one of them expressions of utter effacement and complete nothingness. This is the utmost bounty from your honor. And another petition is that the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their feet - and likewise the Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree, all offer the Most Glorious Greatest Greeting to your honor. And regarding what you had written about Khan and the items he sent, it was submitted to the Most Holy Court, and likewise the letter they had written to this servant. A Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Divine Will in response to a petition from one of the deputies there and was sent, and likewise a Tablet specifically for Aqa Mirza Husayn who is with them. God willing, along with this servant's letter, through your honor's kindness it will reach them. As for the details of their items, they were mentioned in the petition submitted to the honored Teacher - upon him be all the most glorious Glory \\[...\\] and likewise a brief mention appears in Khan's own letter which will come to your honor's notice. The Glory be upon you, then Grandeur, Might and Majesty be upon you. The Servant. In the year 1294. Another submission is that his honor Haji Mirza Muhammad Taqi - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - wrote a letter to this servant and sent some funds as your honor has written, and they appointed this servant as agent to take whatever is deemed advisable and present it at the Most Holy Court. Therefore this servant obtained some wheat specifically for the Household and pilgrim house. If your honor can send the funds in cash to pay for that wheat it would be preferable, otherwise whatever your honor deems advisable may be done, since in these days all items have increased in price due to the war - for example wheat has reached eight tumans per Persian kharvar and increases daily - and likewise regarding the other funds that were mentioned. Another submission is that several letters were written in response to the blessed letters of the friends of God - upon them be the Glory of God - and were sent; the sooner they arrive the better. May my spirit be sacrificed for you - this matter had been overlooked and since its submission was necessary it is hereby submitted: The vases that were sent last were very well received. They said although the Most Great Prison was not and is not a place for using such items, yet since their craftsmanship was refined and perfect, We accepted them, and these bear no resemblance whatsoever to the previous vases. End quote. And they were not given to the intended person for whom these items had been specifically requested. And in truth, since this was glad tidings, it was therefore submitted. The Servant.\n\n=== END BH00906 ===\n\n=== START BH00907 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and universal His bounty!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath lit the lamp of knowledge in the contingent world, illumined the horizon of the universe with the lights of wisdom and utterance, and caused the streams of science and certitude to flow from the depths of hearts. He it is before Whose Name's majesty all existence hath prostrated itself, before Whose command's source all necks have bowed. Blessed is he who hath sought the precincts of His mercy and dwelt beneath the shade of the Tree of His loving-kindness. Glorified and exalted be His dominion, and mighty His proof! He is unique in His command and will, and singular in His unity and worship. He loved to be known, so He created; they needed God, so He provided. He inspired man and taught him utterance, and caused the jewels of wisdom to appear from the tongue. From Him is the beginning and unto Him the return, and He is the Judge at the beginning and the end. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO thou who circlest round the Tree of Knowledge, who comest unto the carpet of certitude and arrivest at the stream of faith! I have heard the melodies of the nightingale of thy utterance upon the branches of the paradise of fidelity and the cooings of the dove of thy exposition upon the twigs of the gardens of praise. May God reward thee with the best of both worlds and the eternal life of all the worlds, for thou hast remembered those who were banished through the lands, whom the servants denied, and whom the people of tyranny and enmity persecuted. Grieve not at the delay in sending the reply. By thy life, O beloved! The heart delighteth in naught save the remembrance of the loved ones, and the thirst of love is quenched only through correspondence with those possessed of love and unity. However, the press of occupations preventeth me some days from mentioning the friends of my Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. I beseech God, the King of Eternity and the Ruler by the Greatest Name, to protect thee and His loved ones beneath the shadow of His protection and shelter, to give you to drink continually from the Kawthar of His grace and favor, and to aid you in that whereby your mention shall endure in existence and your names be exalted in the worlds of the unseen and the seen. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Loving.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned in thy letter concerning arrival in the Land of ?a and the gathering of thy Lord's loved ones, the Lord of Names, it hath been proven with evidence that God's Cause shall triumph over all possibility, and soon shall the lights of the Sun of Knowledge encompass the whole world and the radiance of the Orb of Unity prevail over all nations. He hath said--and His word is most exalted--\"Thou shalt see the earth as the Most Glorious Paradise; on that day shall those possessed of knowledge rejoice and the heedless shall lament.\" Whosoever perceiveth this manifest Cause with the eye of certitude and beholdeth its firm and steadfast foundation shall be assured that creation is beneath its shadow and that there is no escape for anyone nor refuge for any soul--all shall return unto Him and arrive at the path of love. It hath been said aforetime that affairs are bound to their appointed times. Soon shall they behold the sun of knowledge and its lights, and shall comprehend its signs.\n\nAnd as to what thou hast mentioned concerning the land of Ha and Mim, and thy praise of the loved ones of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, from among the people of the Bayan and the inheritors of Him Who conversed with God - blessed are they for having cast away vain imaginings, shattered the idols, and attained the recognition of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Wonder not at what thou seest of traces in the righteous ones. Ponder upon the appearance of the Sun of Truth, its effulgences, the spreading of its lights, and the manifestation of its signs. It behooveth the peoples of the world to immerse themselves in the seas of civilization and prosperity, and to adorn themselves with the ornament of knowledge and success. Hath there appeared in existence that which hath shone forth in this manifest Day? Say: Glorified be He in Whose hand is the dominion of all things and in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names. We beseech God to manifest from all that which indicateth His favors and to adorn His loved ones with the ornament of His character and attributes, that the mirrors of their hearts may reflect naught except the radiance of the lights of the Sun of eternity, that their faces may show forth naught but the freshness of fellowship and purity, and that from their companionship naught may be witnessed save the signs of love and fidelity. O thou beloved of the heart! Convey wondrous remembrance and glorification from this servant to the loved ones of thy Lord in Ta and those who dwell in Mim after Ha. Glory and praise be upon them and upon every steadfast soul who hath turned towards Him.\n\nAnd regarding what thou hast mentioned about presenting thy remembrance and the names of those thou hast mentioned before the face of thy Ancient Lord, and thy request for the outpouring of the favors of His Most Bountiful Name through His abundant grace - when I saw thy letter and understood thy message, I attained the presence of His court and presented \\[what thou hadst requested\\] before the face of the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. There hath been sent down for thee and for them from the heaven of grace and bounty that which will move creation and which thou shalt receive in another leaf. Blessed art thou and they through this most great favor and supreme gift.\n\nAnd concerning what thou hast mentioned about reflection upon the world and the prevalence of doubts and intimations among all peoples and their failure to turn to God, the Lord of eternity - grieve not at what thou seest of the veiled ones and the wanderers, but rejoice in the power of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment. It behooveth the people of Baha to exert their utmost in spreading the commandments of the Lord of Names and not to look upon the deprivation of those who are remote, but rather to the Source of their Lord's command, Who prevaileth over all things. Verily, the example of one who desireth to teach in these days is like unto him who planteth trees and looketh not to the length of time for gathering the fruits, but is rather eager to plant that others may benefit therefrom, even as he hath benefited from those who preceded him. Doth anyone doubt the fruits of this mighty tree? Nay, by our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing! Should nations and governments arise to extinguish this Light that shineth from the horizon of Sinai, they shall never be able, nor shall they have the power, even should they aid one another.\n\nAs to what thou hast mentioned regarding the verses of thy Lord, and thy desire for that which hath been sent down from the Source of Command concerning healing exhortations and sufficient, complete counsels - I beseech God for confirmation and success that thou mayest gather what hath been revealed in this connection, and We shall send it to thee through the grace of our Lord, the All-Bestowing. And I beseech God to make thee a standard of guidance and a sign of steadfastness, and to guide through thee those who are ready, and that thy teaching may direct the seekers. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth, and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Informed.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord and my Hope! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name and Thy most perfect Mystery to send down upon Thy loved ones that which will strengthen their hearts, dilate their breasts, illumine their eyes, and enable them to guide Thy servants to the meadows of righteousness and lead humanity to the gardens of knowledge. Thou art He Whose grace hath encompassed all existence and Whose mercy hath pervaded both the seen and the unseen. I beseech Thee to protect Thy loved ones beneath the shadow of Thy safekeeping, to ward off from them the evil of the wicked among Thy creatures, and to ordain for them the good of both this world and the next beneath the shadow of Thy Most Great Name, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. May the glory rest upon them through the permanence of Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes.\n\n=== END BH00907 ===\n\n=== START BH00908 ===\n\nThe honored physician, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is God - exalted be His station of grandeur and power!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath adorned the world with the lights of His firm Command and hath manifested what He desired for the advancement of the peoples, and hath bidden them to bow down in humility before those who were drawn to the Manifestations of eternity, through whom was raised the standard that there is none other God but Him. Exalted, exalted be His station, and exalted, exalted be His might and grandeur! He is the One Who hath embellished the brocade of existence with the mention of the Seal, through Whom was revealed that which was hidden in His knowledge and inscribed in His Book and remembered in the hearts of those near unto God and the minds of the sincere ones. Prayers and peace be upon Him and His family and His companions whom God made the stars of the heaven of His grace and the ships of bounty, and through them He revealed what He desired, though the idolaters detest it.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Your letter hath brought me joy and your words have stirred me for they wafted the fragrance of the love of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal. The servant beseecheth his Lord in all conditions to strengthen you and assist you to mention and praise Him in the Kingdom of Creation. O thou who art remembered in the heart of this servant! The station of Islam hath declined, religion hath weakened, and the banners have been reversed. We must supplicate God in the nights and days, at eventide and dawn, that He may assist His loved ones and servants and raise up one who shall arise to redress what hath been lost. Your honor hath heard what the strong hath wrought upon the weak, and what hath befallen God's cities and lands from cannons and rifles. We beseech God to adorn the world with the ornament of justice that perchance the fire of hatred may be stilled. Verily, He is the Ruler over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThereafter His writing was presented before His face. They said: God willing, may they be occupied at all times with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love emanateth from them. They have spent successive years in service until the light of gray hair hath appeared upon their countenance. God willing, may they be safe and protected and gladden the friends with greetings and salutations on our behalf.\n\nAs to what was written concerning the House and his honor Mirza regarding \\[Baha'u'llah\\]: their best course is to say what they had said at first and acknowledge that all these properties belong there. If from the beginning, during the upheavals in that land, they had spoken truthfully and stated that these properties were not theirs, none of these matters would have occurred and they would have found themselves at ease in every way. For His Holiness and they themselves know that in this place nothing even as fine as a hair has emerged or will emerge that deviates from justice and fairness, and their interests would certainly have been protected in any case. A hundred thousand regrets that one should be heedless of what benefits them and be unaware of their own harm and benefit. All their properties revert to this place according to valid deeds, but when the decree of imprisonment, trials and emigration came to pass, they did not release even one house. Although in truth this matter arose from their fear, yet one of their station should not be so weakened by the clamor of the heedless that a house which was the dwelling place of the Desired One should come to such a pass that one of the friends must repeatedly purchase it to uphold the Cause. God is witness that I do not consider this fitting for his honor Mirza, for this shame and disgrace will endure until the Day of Resurrection. We hope that God willing, they themselves will arise to make amends for what has passed. A petition from them reached the Most Holy Court. God willing a reply will be sent later. Regarding them, from before, that is from the beginning of the upheavals in that land, the friends were written to not interfere in any way and to remain silent and say nothing discourteous. Convey my greetings to them. As for what you wrote about purchasing the House, in light of what was previously submitted, they said how can we buy our own property again? For now we are content with imprisonment. But all bear witness that all those properties belong to this place, unless they wish to transgress justice and fairness and speak falsely. But afterwards some friends came to this servant \\[saying the House\\] should be saved from the hands of the heedless. Therefore as per the previous telegram this was expressed to that beloved one. And truly this servant pondered that if he takes action it is not permissible since it is clear and evident that the properties have no connection to his honor Mirza, and if no action is taken it is observed that House is afflicted and tormented by the heedless ones themselves. And it is a pity that that House from which the mention of God, exalted be His glory, was raised night and day should now fall into ignorant hands. And this servant had no funds ready to send and did not wish to burden anyone. Therefore this servant wrote to his honor Afnan to purchase it in his own name at the price that beloved one had written. Later God willing when funds arrive this servant will deliver them to his honor Afnan. The Command is in God's hands, the Lord of all worlds. We place our trust in Him in all matters. We beseech from His wondrous bounty that He protect us from errors and mistakes and assist us in what He has commanded in His wise Book. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nI convey greetings and nothingness to all the friends in that land. May all be confirmed in that which God loves. Peace be upon you all, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Again I submit that if the friends in that land can acquire the House according to the wish of that Beloved One, it would be most excellent. In truth, it is mentioned and described as the King of deeds and the Sovereign of what is known. And according to that Beloved One's words, to sacrifice this unworthy sum for the House is, outwardly, the highest of all deeds that has been or ever shall be, for its remembrance is enduring and everlasting, adorned with the ornament of immortality, and the sum will eventually reach them. So either the first option or this one, whichever is feasible, would be good - whether they acquire it from that land or the House. May all the friends of that land be assisted to achieve that from which the fragrance of sanctity, holiness and what is known wafts forth. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.\n\n=== END BH00908 ===\n\n=== START BH00909 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, transcendent in His glory and power!\n\nPraise be to Him Who hath appeared and revealed what He desired on a Day whereon the Pharaohs and their hosts were shaken and the tyrants and their ranks were made to tremble. He Who hath spoken forth a Word and made it a balance from His presence, a path from His nearness, a trumpet by His command, a cry by His will, a catastrophe by His decree, and an inevitable event by His sovereignty. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it and held fast thereunto, and woe betide him who hath cast it behind him and turned away therefrom. Exalted, exalted be its Creator, its Manifestor, and its Revealer!\n\nI pray and offer salutations upon those who answered the call of God when it was raised in truth and who acted according to what they were commanded in His perspicuous Book. These are servants whom God hath described through the tongue of the Prophets and Messengers. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! They are those whom neither the clamor of the heedless nor the doubts of the wayward deterred from God. They arose to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as the eye of creation hath never beheld. To this beareth witness the Lord of invention. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO thou who art mentioned in My heart! I was gladdened by what flowed from thy pen in remembrance of our Lord and thy Lord. By thy life! The fragrances of thy words so transported Me that I am unable to describe it by pen or tongue, for it was adorned with praise of our Lord, the All-Merciful. His is the praise and favor for having aided thee to remember and praise Him, and for having granted Me the joy of receiving thy letter which spoke in remembrance of Him besides Whom none should be remembered. When I became aware of it, I approached the Presence and presented its contents before His countenance. Thereupon the tongue of the Beloved spoke forth in the Kingdom of utterance, saying in His sweetest voice: O Ali! The servant present here hath appeared and read what thou didst send unto him, and We have remembered thee with this wondrous remembrance. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as We have found from thee the fragrance of contentment in whatsoever hath been decreed and ordained by God, the Creator of heaven. O Ali! Every relationship hath clung to the cord of God and His kinship. Blessed is the servant who hath recognized that which the Wronged One hath uttered in this exalted station. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid you and assist you in that which He loveth and is pleased with. He is, verily, the Lord of the latter and the former worlds. There is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Grieve not for what hath befallen you in these days. Be patient in what God hath decreed and ordained, for verily He loveth the patient ones.\n\nWith a hundred thousand tongues must thou praise and glorify the Best-Beloved of the worlds, Who hath assisted thee to utter words from which the fragrance of contentment was wafted. This is that word which hath ever been and will ever be remembered before God and is acceptable in His presence. Thus have We remembered thee from the precincts of the Prison, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nWe make mention of Ali-Qabli-Akbar who hath attained unto that which most of mankind hath not attained, and We remember Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, the One, the Single, who turned towards God, heard and attained unto that which was recorded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. We send Our prayers, Our peace and Our glorification upon My loved ones in that place, from whom the Concourse on High perceiveth the fragrance of love and of turning unto God, the One, the Single, the All-Informed. Blessed are they and happy are they in that they have taken and drunk and have said: \"Praise be to God, the Goal of the worlds.\" The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon such of God's servants as are patient.\n\nWe remember once again him who was named Ali who attained unto My presence, then he who was named Muhammad-Taqi who circumambulated the Throne that they might give thanks and be numbered among those who praise. We glorify them as We glorified them the first time and We mention them again with this clear remembrance for which the spirits of the world would be sacrificed, yet the peoples are in mighty veils. And We make mention of him who was named Ali-Asghar and give him the glad-tidings of what the servant present here hath done on his behalf and how he arose to serve his Lord after permission was granted. Verily this is a great bounty. And We make mention of My servant who attained unto My presence and circumambulated the Prison out of love for My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The glory be upon you from God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO beloved of My heart! Praise be to God that through the favors of the Beloved thou hast attained again and again and hast been and art under the glances of His grace. Though what hath come to pass hath caused infinite sorrows, yet since the compassionate, merciful, generous, and kind One is manifest and evident, He transformeth all hardships with a single word and attributeth steadfast and assured souls unto Himself. May all existence be a sacrifice unto His favor! At a time when man is immersed in the ocean of sorrows to such extent that no trace of joy is visible, by merely attaining His presence, through one word the wings of joy grow and through another word he learneth to soar. Who is able to praise God, the Lord of the worlds? The essence of praise hath confessed its impotence, the reality of gratitude its inability to reach Him, the truth of glorification its remoteness and evanescence, and the kingdom of knowledge its heedlessness and forgetfulness. He is the Sanctified One to Whose loftiness, sanctity and glory all things have testified. There is none other God but He, the Just, the Generous, the Merciful.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the aforementioned gardener, the described tree, the characterized flowers, the radiant shining realities, and the manifest crimson anemones - the heart was encompassed with joy upon beholding this. For it is verified and known that your honor, in whatever place or station you may be, have been and are engaged in the remembrance, thought, purpose and contemplation of that which is related to the Truth - how much more so with His exalted Name, His exalted Remembrance, His exalted Light, and His exalted Word. God willing, the roses of that rose-garden and the trees of that paradise - His remembrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven - have been and shall ever be fragrant and fruitful in the garden of inner meanings, which in one station hath been interpreted as the Book of God. Furthermore, convey on behalf of this evanescent one to each and every one of the friends expressions of nothingness, glory and sincerity. God is the witness and testifier that they have always been and are before my sight, save in those moments when this servant himself is heedless and, in accordance with \"naught appears from the heedless save that which profiteth him not, nor that which is beneath him,\" is preoccupied. Praise be to God that all those souls who exist are turned toward the Truth and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon. The fragrance of divine love is diffused from them. To this doth testify this evanescent servant, and beyond him, his eternal Lord. Glory be upon your honor, upon them, and upon those who have attained unto the loving-kindness of God, their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00909 ===\n\n=== START BH00910 ===\n\nO Abdul-Majid, upon him be the Glory of God!\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Responding\n\nSay: O concourse of the learned ones, the mystics and the rulers!

We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make His servants aware and not deprive them of the outpourings of His days.\n\nO Majid! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thou should be occupied day and night in praise and thanksgiving to the one Desired One, for He hath confirmed thee and guided thee to the straight path of justice. Thou didst turn and attain the ultimate goal and the supreme height. His grace encompassed thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Desired One, and glory be unto Thee, O my Lord, for having given me to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the living waters of immortality. I testify to Thy grace which, at the dawning of its Light, obliterated the traces of the grace of all peoples. I beseech Thee by the suns of the heavens of Thy mercy and the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance to make me, in all conditions, hold fast unto Thee and Thy verses, and to remain fixed upon Thine horizon. I testify, O my God, that Thy generosity hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen, and Thy grace hath surrounded all that hath been created by the Command \"Be.\" I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the wonders of Thy grace and bounty, nor to deny me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trustees. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nO Majid! By the testimony of the Most Exalted Pen, thou hast been honored with a deed that hath no likeness or equal. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, in my standing and my sitting, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, in my prostration and my bowing, and glory be unto Thee in my sleep and my wakefulness, and majesty be unto Thee in all my conditions and states. I confess, O my God, in this station, to that which the Manifestations of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-places of Thy signs have confessed: that Thou art not remembered except through Thyself, nor described except through Thyself. Therefore, I have abandoned myself and all that I possess, clinging to the hem of Thy grace, Thy mercy and Thy generosity, that Thou mayest ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and honor me with Thy good-pleasure. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Most Generous of the generous. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nLo, We have desired to make mention of him who was named Valiyu'llah, that he may rejoice and be of them that render thanks. It is hoped that thou shalt attain unto the essence of this name and that there may flow from the Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth the Day of God. O Vali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The former sect, for twelve hundred years and more, deluded by the claim that they believed in immediate succession, reached such a pass of pride that they reckoned themselves the most excellent and learned of all peoples; yet on the Day of Reckoning they were seen to be the most ignorant, abject and lost of all the world's factions, and in their wretchedness they reached such depths that their divines pronounced death upon the Most Pure Blood, while their ignorant ones arose to abuse, revile and curse. Glory be to God! Now too the deniers of the Bayan cling to a name from among names, remaining heedless and veiled from the Lord of all being and the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names. O Vali! Arise to aid My Cause and purify hearts from rancor and hatred through My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names. He, verily, will aid thee and reinforce thee with the hosts of utterance. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe moreover desired to make mention of him who was named Haji Aqa and give him glad tidings of this Revelation whereby earth and heaven have spoken forth. Rejoice, O people, in the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, through Whom the fruits have appeared, the rivers have flowed, the mysteries have emerged, the seas of knowledge and utterance have surged, and the fragrance of God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting, has wafted. Thy name was present before the Wronged One, Who hath sent down for thee that whereby the fragrance of the garment hath been diffused throughout the world. Thy Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving.\n\nO Muhammad-Quli Khan! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of 'Akka. Verily it hath been raised with such sovereignty as no hosts or armies can withstand. We beseech God to ordain for thee the good of all His worlds and to make thee steadfast in His love to such degree that neither the might of the people would frighten thee nor the roaring of any oppressor who hath turned away from God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. When thou hast attained unto My verses and heard My call, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and for having remembered me with that which shall never perish, by virtue of Thy Most Beautiful Names and Thy most exalted attributes. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs, by the Daysprings of Thy Revelation and the Repositories of Thy knowledge, to enable me to serve Thy Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the allusions of the croakers nor the calumnies of those who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs and have turned away from Him Who standeth in Thy stead. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Encompassing over the seen and the unseen.\n\nO Majid! Thou hast arisen for God, for His Cause and His Face, and hast attained unto that which hath been the hope of the sincere ones and those nigh unto God. Each of the souls mentioned hath attained unto that which shall endure and remain immortalized in the Book of God. We have repeatedly made mention of all the loved ones of that land, and We beseech God to make them all steadfast, inasmuch as in these days the enemies have encompassed them round about. Outwardly they act with humility and submissiveness, yet inwardly, from the Land of Ta unto the Great City, they are engaged in stirring up sedition. They have secretly incited certain people and kept them in that city. Each day bringeth fresh harm and manifest oppression, while the Wronged One, in the midst of tribulations and adversities, remaineth firm in the Cause and uttereth the divine decrees. Neither the tyranny of the Pharaohs hath deterred Him, nor the might of tyrants hath frightened Him. He calleth out with His most exalted Voice, saying: \"O people! Cast away what ye possess, for He Who is the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come from the heaven of bounty with clear sovereignty.\" The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon every patient and thankful soul. We conclude Our words with mention of Ibn-i-Dakhil, and counsel all to observe trustworthiness, godliness, unity and concord. Blessed is he who hath hearkened and acted accordingly, and woe betide the heedless. Unity is itself one of the hosts of God, as attesteth every man of learning who hath turned unto God, the Lord of existence.\n\n=== END BH00910 ===\n\n=== START BH00911 ===\n\nThe Essence Most Holy, Most Ancient, Most Great, Most Powerful, Most Exalted, Most Glorious\n\nThe essence of praise and glory befitteth Him alone Whom the mystics, possessed of the secrets of reality and utterance, have found themselves powerless to know, and before Whose absolute Being they have confessed their utter nothingness. I testify that He hath been sanctified beyond both eternity and perpetuity, how much more beyond all creation and extinction. For the eternity that can be described by tongue or characterized by utterance is not, and never shall be, worthy of Him. Hearts and minds are bewildered in comprehending even a single one of His signs - how much more bewildered must they be in knowing His Essence, which transcendeth all mention and description.\n\nHe hath created the whole world through His Primal Word, and all do acknowledge and confess this truth. Yet none hath ever understood that Word, let alone its Creator and Source. For if it be claimed that this Word is like unto words that flow from the tongue, this would be sheer injustice and pure fabrication, since such words are subject to extinction while the Word of God is sanctified therefrom. And if it be said that it is of the words that flow from the pen, this too is bounded by contingent limitations, while the Divine Word is exalted above such constraints.\n\nThis evanescent servant beareth witness that this Word hath never been subject to extinction or annihilation, nor hath it been confined by expressions and meanings. None knoweth it save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. When the powerlessness of all to know His Word is established, who then could possess the strength and ability to soar in the heavens of knowing the King of the Word? All contingent being hath testified to its impotence and extinction, and knowledge itself hath confessed its inadequacy and inability. Exalted, immeasurably exalted is He above whatsoever is mentioned in the realm of contingent being! Exalted, immeasurably exalted is He above whatsoever is defined by utterance! We beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant us success in speaking that which He hath permitted us and in acting according to what He hath commanded us in His firm, transcendent, impregnable, mighty and inaccessible Book.\n\nYour letter addressed to this evanescent servant was received. Praised and thanked be God that you are occupied with the mention and glorification of God. As for what you mentioned regarding Ibn Sh J, God willing, he hath been and shall continue to be victorious. We beseech God to aid him in all conditions to champion His Cause through wisdom and utterance.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the association of certain companions with them - this matter is certainly outside of wisdom, for if such souls become too well known, they will no longer be able to serve the Cause as they should. All the loved ones of God and those who drink from the wine of inner meanings must reflect on this matter. Today all are commanded to observe wisdom, as the divine Books and heavenly Tablets bear witness. Therefore, they must at all times keep their gaze fixed on wisdom and hold fast to it. Observe how throughout the history of the Cause, whenever wisdom was lacking, it led to the extinguishing of souls, the perturbation of hearts, and the avoidance of the people of the earth. Divine mercy has taken precedence and His grace has encompassed all. Today those who are adorned with the ornament of faith must strive with the utmost effort to engage in matters that draw people near and guide the deniers and the doubtful to the horizon of certitude with utmost kindness and love. Most people are heedless of the Truth and unaware of the surging oceans of generosity and bounty. Their suppositions and desires have prevented them from the Most Exalted Horizon. They know not what has appeared in the world, for they are afflicted with the diseases of ignorance. The maladies of the people of the world must be cured through the breaths of holy, pure, and detached souls. O my brother, such souls have been and will be rare to find. However, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to raise up souls in every land who will arise to serve His Cause as befitting and who will detach themselves from self and all else in the path of His love. Had the loved ones of God acted upon the compassionate divine counsels until now, the earth would surely have been transformed. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to raise up in every land those who will voice His praise and act according to what is commanded in His Book, and who will hold fast to His good-pleasure, which He has made the ultimate goal for all humanity. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth. None can stay His dominion, none can repel His sovereignty, and none can turn back His decisive, firm, and mighty command.\n\nFurthermore, the loved ones of God must today be manifestations of divine wealth and independence. In this way, their words will prove effective in hearts. Among all breezes, the breeze of detachment and independence is like the spring winds that cause human fruits to appear in the contingent world. Blessed is he who attains to this glorious and exalted station. The Supreme Pen has at all times commanded His loved ones to that which exalts the Cause of God, but few are found who act accordingly. Convey sublime greetings from this evanescent one to all the friends of God in those regions and say: These are the days of service and the days of love. God willing, all must drink from the Kawthar of affection in complete unity. Discord causes the dissipation of God's Cause while unity causes its exaltation. He has said, and His word is the truth: \"Adorn your temples with the ornament of humility, your hearts with the ornament of love and unity, and your tongues with His glorious and beautiful remembrance.\" And the details of your letter were at one time presented before the Most Holy Court. His exalted Word \\[...\\]\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! We have enjoined upon all men that which beseemeth the Days of God. Some have accepted and acted upon that which was commanded, and others have cast it behind their backs. Blessed are they that have acted accordingly. It behooveth every soul to hold fast unto that which hath been sent down in the Tablets from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. He hath desired naught for Himself, but hath summoned all to that which shall profit them both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Tongue of Grandeur in His Most Great Prison. Glorified be they who have fulfilled the Covenant of God and stood firm in His wondrous Cause. We make mention of those who have adorned themselves with the raiment of steadfastness amidst all creation. These are the people of Baha in the kingdom of creation. Upon them rest My glory and My mercy that hath encompassed all worlds. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before His Throne, and for having thy name flow from the tongue of the Wronged One in this glorious station.\n\nGod willing, may you be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Self-Sufficing Lord and be gladdened by His love. The glory shining forth from the Dayspring of Glory be upon the people of Baha.\n\n=== END BH00911 ===\n\n=== START BH00912 ===\n\nAkka. The honored Name of God M H, upon him be \\[Baha\\] Abha. 24 Sha'ban 1303.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!\n\nPraise befits and is worthy of that Intended One Who has placed in the letters of His loved ones the effect of the Water of Life, for it quenches thirst and removes weariness. The hand is His hand and the power is His power, glorified be the Creator! And blessings and peace be upon the Leader of all who are on earth, their Sovereign, their Educator, their Teacher and their Guide, and upon His family and companions who conquered the lands in the name of their Lord, the Master of creation.\n\nAnd then, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your honor! The letter from your honor along with the accompanying correspondence arrived and attained the honor of being heard by the Master. He said: \"O My Name! Upon thee be My peace and loving-kindness.\" Whatever was sent, this servant present made mention of it. The letter of H and S ibn-i-Qubad (upon him be my Baha) which he sent to this servant present was read before His countenance. Verily We heard his call and answered him. We found from his words the fragrance of his love and steadfastness. Blessed are those souls whom the ephemeral affairs of these two days have not deprived of the breezes of revelation nor prevented from the horizon of light. Likewise was seen the letter of Siyyid Farajullah (upon him be my Baha) which he sent to that honored one. Praise be to God, they have drunk from the cup of faithfulness. This is from God's grace upon him. Also the letter of Aqa Muhammad Hashim attained the honor of being heard. We beseech God, exalted be He, to inscribe with His Most Exalted Pen for those whose names were present before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison that which will draw them near unto Him in all His worlds, and to ordain for them what He has ordained for His loved ones and chosen ones, and to assist them with the hosts of the unseen and the visible. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who were not deprived by the ephemeral causes of the world from the eternal Kingdom of God. These are the people of the highest Paradise and the companions of the Crimson Ark.\n\nO My Name! The petition of Haji Ahmad, upon him be My Baha, has reached the Most Holy Court. We have heard his remembrance, his praise and his call in the love of God, his Lord and the Lord of the worlds and the Ancient King. We make mention of him and beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to strengthen him to remain steadfast in His firm and mighty Cause. We have seen what one of the aforementioned Sayyids sent, who was named Ali-Naqi. We have previously made mention of him in such wise that the sincere ones would perceive from it the fragrance of his turning to God and his steadfastness in His Cause. We beseech the Exalted One to ordain for him that which befitteth His generosity and favors. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nConvey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends of God. Today, every soul that hath turned unto Him, his light is manifest before the Throne and his cause is evident. That which is necessary today is steadfastness in the Cause. The barking ones, in accordance with what hath previously flowed from the Supreme Pen, are striving with utmost hypocrisy to lead astray the people of the Covenant. By the life of God! They are in manifest error, wandering blindly in the wilderness of perdition. Their light and understanding have been taken from them in recompense for their deeds. Verily thy Lord is the Executor, the All-Wise.\n\nTwo days ago We observed the letter of Ali-Akbar, who hath emigrated and attained, which he sent to thee. They have mentioned a good deed. Blessed is he who remembereth and blessed is he who acteth. Out of grace and for the promulgation of such deeds as are acceptable in the sight of God, two Tablets were sent - one specifically for him who remembered and the other for him who acted. Would that all souls who are firm in the Truth and detached from aught else would hold fast to such lofty and goodly deeds. By the life of God! These deeds are and have ever been the hosts of Truth, and through these hosts the cities of hearts have been and will be conquered. We beseech the Exalted One to aid His loved ones, protect them from the evil of His enemies, and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nThose two Tablets were sent; let them be forwarded. Likewise, the letter of Muhammad-Hasan, upon him be My Baha, arrived. We read it and make mention of him. We beseech the Exalted One to strengthen him and assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. The letter was adorned with the handwriting of him who loveth God and His loved ones, namely Rida, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy. Likewise with the mention of Husayn ibn Hasan from H.R., upon them both be My Baha and My loving-kindness. Verily he traversed land and sea until he attained the presence and heard the call of the Wronged One. We have mentioned him and make mention of him, and We beseech God to manifest through him that which shall endure throughout the dominion of the kingdom and the realm. Praise be to God, the Transformer of hearts.\n\nThe letter concluded with mention of Muhammad ibn Marfu', Sheikh Abu-Turab, who attained the presence and drank the wine of reunion from the hands of bounty. We beseech the True One to make him a true heir - heir to wisdom and knowledge, faith and certitude, and steadfastness. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him through His sovereignty and to ordain for him the best of what lieth in His worlds. Verily, He hath power over all things. The End.\n\nPraise be to God! All letters sent to your eminence attained the honor of being heard, and each was blessed with sublime and exalted favor. According to your eminence's command, they should send forth and dispatch the replies to the letters, and in each express that which causes hearts to be enkindled with the fire of the love of God. And regarding the mention of his honor AF, his holiness M.H., may the Most Glorious Glory of God rest upon him, which was in your eminence's writing, after submission, the Lord, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, said: \"O Mahdi, upon thee be My peace and My favor.\" His honor Afnan, may the Glory of the All-Merciful rest upon him, is ever present before His countenance, and the effulgent lights of the Sun of bounty have been and are directed towards him. By the life of God! He is indeed beneath an extended shade, an upraised pavilion, and an elevated tree. Praise be to God, he has been and is confirmed, and we beseech from the Truth that His confirmation be his companion, His success his friend, His grace his intimate, and His favor his associate. Beseech from the Truth that He ordain his nearness, that is, in outward appearance. End.\n\nLast week, His honor AF also sent this servant a writing, and while engaged in preparing a response, news arrived that His honor was intending to proceed to the Holy Place by way of Sidon. Therefore, the submission of the reply was left pending. I beseech and hope from the Truth, exalted be His Glory, that He may confirm and assist him in all matters.\n\nAnd regarding the mention of departure, God willing, may they set forth on Saturday in perfect health and well-being, and return. And peace and praise be upon your eminence and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\n=== END BH00912 ===\n\n=== START BH00913 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power!\n\nPraise and gratitude befit the sanctified and most holy court of that Remembered One Who hath illumined the world of being with the new radiance and wondrous light of utterance. At the first dawning of His effulgence, countless veils and shrouds appeared, all of which He rent asunder with the finger of divine power, causing His Cause to become manifest from the most exalted horizon. The desires of the world and its peoples could not prevent Him. With supreme steadfastness He conveyed His message before all humanity, and through this conveyance illumined the world. Glory be unto God, Who made the Perfect Power, the Source of the lights of knowledge, learning, books, scriptures and arts, to appear in the Hijaz - a place adorned with naught but rocks and thorny shrubs. Glorified be His grandeur, His power, His might and His sovereignty, that He made such a place the point of adoration for all who dwell on earth and in heaven, and likewise the Kaaba of the monotheists and those near unto God. Were one to truly reflect, he would spend his entire life uttering \"Power belongeth unto God!\" How many polytheists strove and labored to extinguish the Muhammadan Light, yet the Hand of Power preserved the lamp of His knowledge and wisdom within the glass of grace and bounty, despite the polytheists and the proud ones.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God and my Aim! Send down at all times the rain of Thy mercy upon the monotheists. O Lord! Thou seest them encompassed by Thy creation. Deliver them, through Thy power which hath conquered all contingent things, from their evil and their greed. Then preserve, O my God, Thy cities and Thy lands through the angels and the Spirit. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived, bringing comfort and blessing, with fresh fruits arranged in perfect order within vessels of words. Praise be to God, each was a delicate food and a luminous blessing. We partook with sincere appetite, offered thanks and praise, and became occupied with glorification. Following its presentation, He said: \"O Yahya, upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of all beings! Never has the mention of your honor and the fruit of the tree of love been forgotten, nor shall it ever be, God willing. Praise be to God, your deeds are accepted and your efforts appreciated. Repeatedly mention the fruit on behalf of the Wronged One. It is incumbent upon all to assist him in every matter. We beseech God to illumine the world of existence with the light of His loved ones and to cause new, wondrous, and fresh fruits to appear from the trees of the garden of meanings and utterances. He is the Powerful One Whom the limitations of the contingent world cannot reach. His Command is truth and His decree is certain. In that station, there is no place for why and wherefore. O Abdul-Husayn! God is witness and aware that thou art beheld as sustenance upon the table, present both day and night. We beseech God to assist thee in that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to make thee among those who have aided His Cause through wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have mentioned and continue to mention the loved ones of that land. We have sent a small stream from the rivers of the Sadat to that direction, namely Inayatullah. We beseech God to protect him and those who have turned unto Him with radiant faces and illumined hearts. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and worthy to respond.\"\n\nThe Ocean of Utterance surgeth at all times, and the Luminary of Assurance dawneth in every moment. Glory be to God! The deniers perceive the mirage as water, even as they have counted the learned as ignorant, called the trustworthy treacherous, and named the reformer a corrupter. This evanescent servant hath ever beseeched the True One, exalted be His glory, to increase the power of hearing and preserve the eyes from inflammation and veils, that all may observe with their own eyes and hearken with their own ears.\n\nI convey greetings to the apple of mine eye, nay the apple of existence and the beloved of hearts, that is, Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-Husayn - upon him be God's peace and favors. I beseech the True One, glorified be His majesty, on his behalf whatsoever shall cause the appearance of lasting fruits and eternal qualities. This is not difficult for God, our Lord and our Goal.\n\nThe friends are all remembered, nay they are present in the heart and visible before the eyes. The outpourings of the true Bestower have ever encompassed all and continue to do so, for ye have entrusted all unto Him and have placed your reliance in Him. Verily He is with whosoever hath desired Him, loved Him and mentioned Him. There is no God but He.\n\nThe mention of the beloved of the heart, Aqa Mirza Ahmad - upon him be the Glory of God - was made in His presence and attained the honor of His hearing. We made mention of him and besought from the True One, glorified be His majesty, whatsoever would cause the exaltation of the Word and the advancement of being. God willing, he shall be assisted in the remembrance and praise of the True One and be confirmed in that which hath been recorded and inscribed in God's Book by the divine Pen.\n\nO Yahya, upon thee be God's peace! Make mention on behalf of the Wronged One to him and his relations, both mother and sister. Praise be to God, they have attained that which hath no equal.\n\nHis honor ?ad - upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of creation - praise be to God, attained the privilege of visiting the House of God, and after the visitation and circumambulation proceeded in that direction. We beseech God to protect him from the wolves and dogs of the earth. Verily He hath power over all things.\n\nThis concludes what this evanescent servant hath performed on behalf of him and on behalf of Aqa Mirza Ahmad - upon them both be the Glory of God - that which causeth the loftiness and elevation of the stations of His friends.\n\nAnother submission: Your choice dates which truly reflected the bounty of the True One, glorified be His majesty, arrived distinguished and acceptable. However, the spiritual friend, His honor Aqa Siyyid Taqi - upon him be God's peace - was negligent in retrieving and saving them from the steamship house. Nevertheless they arrived. They partook of them repeatedly and repeatedly bestowed them upon the kindred and the circumambulators. \"Well may it do you!\" was heard repeatedly from the blessed tongue, and these \"Well may it do you!\" refer to your honor. I beseech the True One that He may cause a lofty tree to appear from each one and adorn it with the dates of wisdom and utterance. Verily He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer.\n\nPeace, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who have heard and responded and acknowledged the oneness of His Essence and His attributes.\n\nThe Servant\n\nOn the first of Rajab 1305\n\n=== END BH00913 ===\n\n=== START BH00914 ===\n\nO honored Abdu'r-Rahim, upon him be the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Great Glory of God! This is a mention from Our presence to one who has attained unto tribulations and afflictions even as his Lord, the King of Names, attained unto trials beyond the reckoning of all created things. Exalted is God, Creator of the heavens, Who hath made Me a target for the arrows of fate, that the Most Great Word might be made manifest between the heavens and the earth. The Call hath been raised from the luminous Spot, from the crimson Tree: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise!\" The turning away of those who have turned away grieveth Me not, nor doth the acceptance of all the world bring Me joy. Can tribulations ever prevent the Lord of Names from raising His call betwixt earth and heaven? Nay, by His very Self, the True One - witness to this is this Call which hath been raised in the midst of tribulation from the Divine Lote-Tree: \"Behold Me, O people of Baha! This is He Who hath been established upon the Throne and hath manifested Himself unto all created things through His Names that have encompassed the worlds.\" Blessed is he who hath heard this sweetest Call; woe unto the heedless! He who hath heard is neither grieved by the veils of the unbelievers nor by the oppression of those who have turned away from this Straight Path. Blessed is the strong one who hath arisen with the pillar of fire among the wicked and hath spoken forth this wondrous Name. The All-Merciful calleth and saith: \"Blessed art thou, O servant, for thou hast turned thy face toward My countenance, hast drawn nigh unto My court, hast spoken My praise, hast borne tribulation in My love, hast accepted fate for My Name's sake, and hast drunk the choice wine of utterance in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, after all the polytheists had turned away from it in their remoteness.\" We have seized the leader of ignorance who laid claim to knowledge. Thus doth God ordain what hath been sent down in the Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. We sent him a Tablet that hath no equal in all the heavens and earth. He cast away God's Tablet, having followed his own desires. Lo! He is of the companions of the Fire. Through him the fire of sedition was kindled amongst the people, and there befell My loved ones that which caused the Most Exalted Pen to lament in the heaven of eternity. When death came to him and he beheld the punishment, he wailed with the wailing of those who are lost. Then did none of his deeds profit him, and he became of the most grievous losers. God shall soon seize those servants who have wronged, even as He seized aforetime. Verily thy Lord is the Strong, the Great. Convey My greetings unto her who hath believed in her Lord and turned toward the Kaaba of God, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nO Pen of loving-kindness! Make mention of Muhammad-Javad from thy Lord, the Creator of all existence, that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and arise to serve the Cause in such wise that the hints of those who have denied the Day of Judgment shall not deter him. Drink thou a draught from the choice wine of utterance which hath flowed from the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. By My life! It will attract thee in such wise that the clamor of those in the land will not grieve thee. Hold fast unto the Sure Handle through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted among the servants. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to turn toward the court of Thy bounties and to gaze toward the horizon of Thy favors. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which hath dominated all names, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to celebrate Thy praise amongst Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest and art sanctified from all opposites. Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling.\n\nO Most Pure Countenance! Turn from this Most Great Scene unto him who hath been named 'Ali-Akbar, that he may hear the call of the Lord of Destiny from the Tree planted upon the crimson hill. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. By My life! If thou didst but know, thou wouldst sacrifice thyself for this bounty which hath turned unto thee and encompassed all horizons. They that are heedless this day have no portion of the presence of thy Lord, and are indeed among the wayward. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having turned unto thee while He was in the hands of the wicked. He by Whose word all created things were stirred now dwelleth in His house behind drawn curtains - thus have they dealt with Him Whom they invoke at eventide and at dawn. We conceal that which hath befallen Us lest the hearts of the righteous be saddened thereby. Give thanks unto God that the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee and the Tongue of God hath spoken thy name from the most exalted station. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy brother who bowed down when thy Lord appeared with grandeur and might. Convey My greetings unto his face and give him the glad tidings of this remembrance which hath no equal among all in earth and heaven. Then glory from the All-Glorious upon thy wife whom the breathings of thy Lord's days, the Lord of all men, have stirred.\n\nThen We turned unto Our servant Mahdi that he might hear the call of the Everlasting God from this Ancient Beauty, at Whose settling upon the throne all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Forgiving!\" Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken My Name, the eye that hath beheld My signs, the heart that hath recognized My power, the hand that hath taken My Book, and the soul that hath been set ablaze with the fire of love for its Lord, the Almighty, the Compelling. Rejoice thou with this supreme joy and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Author of all names! I testify that Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Most High, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\" Remember on My behalf My handmaiden who hath believed in My signs and attained unto this Cause before which necks have bowed low, and My other handmaiden who hath been illumined by the lights of the Lord and perceived the fragrance of My raiment when it was wafted among the servants.\n\nO Imprisoned Pen! Make mention of Husayn from the Wronged One, that the call of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, may attract him, that he may be assured that My favor hath preceded My loved ones and My mercy hath encompassed Our servants who have sought the most distant Shrine and attained unto the lights of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. By God! Were We to mention what hath befallen Us at the hands of those who have wronged the Remembrance, the heavens would be cleft asunder, the earth would be rent, and the mountains would crumble. Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Loving, inform thee. We praise God in all conditions and rejoice in His remembrance and the exaltation of His Cause among all who witness and are witnessed. Be as thy Lord hath been, such that neither the gestures of the ignorant disturb thee nor the darkness of the desires of those who judge alarm thee. Remember thy Lord at all times and turn not unto those who have cast the covenant and testament of God behind their backs and followed the promptings of their own desires - these are indeed the losers. Blessed art thou, and thy father and mother, and all thy kindred who have turned with illumined hearts unto this praiseworthy station. Ye have stations with your Lord - to this doth testify this exalted and mighty Tablet. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones who have been consumed by the fire of separation - they are indeed of those for whom is ordained the reward of them that have attained unto the presence of the Beloved. We beseech God to assist them to remain steadfast in His Cause in such wise that no rejected polytheist may cause them to waver.\n\n=== END BH00914 ===\n\n=== START BH00915 ===\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst deliver Adam from Satan, and Noah from the flood, and Abraham from the fire, and Moses from Pharaoh, and the Spirit from the Jews, and Muhammad from the Abu-Jahl of the age; and by Thy Name through which the breezes of Thy bounty wafted over the bodies of all created things, and the sun of Thy grace shone upon all who dwell in earth and heaven; and by Thy Name through which every poor one was enriched at the gate of Thy wealth, and every abased one was exalted through the manifestations of Thy mighty glory, and every remote one drew near to the wonders of Thy grace and favors; and by Thy Name through which the sun rose from the horizon of Thy providence, and the pavilion of glory was raised in the kingdom of Thy beneficence, and the trees of unity were planted in the paradise of Thy grace and bounty; and furthermore by Thy Name through which all faces were turned toward Thy face, and all souls were drawn to the shore of Thy holy nearness and meeting, and the birds of the hearts of them who are nigh unto Thee soared in the atmosphere of Thy reunion and glory, and the hearts of the holy ones drank from the cups of Thy divine oneness - that Thou mayest look, O my Beloved, with the glance of Thy favor upon these who have kept vigil on this Night which Thou hast made a festival for Thy creation, wherein Thou didst manifest Thyself by Thy Name the All-Merciful unto all creation, and wherein the Beauty of Thy Lordship was established upon the throne of forgiveness.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by this Night and by those who have kept vigil therein, that Thou mayest send down upon these souls every most perfect good, every most excellent bounty, every most abundant wealth, every most beauteous beauty, every most manifest manifestation, every most steadfast utterance, every most enduring sovereignty, every most perfect word, every most ancient providence, every most powerful sign, every most great name, every most excellent beneficence, every most resplendent glory, every most brilliant radiance, every most powerful might, every most clear permission, every most wondrous book, and every most gentle fruit. For they, O my God, have gathered around Thee on a day when the dwellers of earth have turned away from Thy presence, and have sought the sanctuary of Thy knowledge after all others rejected it. I beseech Thee, O my God, to change their sorrow into joy from Thy presence, and their grief into gladness from Thy court. Send down upon them, O my God, from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will cause to grow from their hearts the plants of Thy knowledge and wisdom. Make them, O my Beloved, so steadfast in Thy love and Thy Cause that should all who are in the heavens and on earth endeavor to prevent them, they would pay no heed to any of them, but would turn with their inner and outer beings toward the court of Thy bounty and grace. Honor them, O my Beloved, with Thy presence on the Day when Thou wilt be established upon the throne of eternity, when the feet of the wise shall slip, and the dwellers of earth and heaven shall tremble.\n\nThen, O my God, leave them not to themselves. Take their hands with the power of Thy grace and gather them before the sovereign of the might of Thy bountifulness. Then raise them up, O my Beloved, unto that which Thou hast purposed for them through the sovereignty of Thy mighty dominion, for this is the good than which there is no likeness in creation nor equal in invention. Verily, Thou art powerful over this, mighty and omnipotent. Glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! I beseech Thee by Thy hidden Name, and by Thy treasured Sign, and by Thy guarded Secret, that Thou deprive not these souls of the surging waves of the sea of Thy oneness, and cause them, O my Desire, to embark upon the ark of Thy glorious might.\n\nO My Hope! Withhold not from them that which Thou hast, and send down upon them that whereby their spirits may be calmed, their hearts reassured, their souls established, their tongues loosed, their minds soar, their eyes be gladdened, their ears hear, and their hearts be enraptured, that they may be drawn, O my Beloved, by the breezes of Thy days, which none have attained save those whom Thou hast chosen for the recognition of Thy Self, elected for Thy Revelation and inspiration, approved for the manifestation of Thy Cause and sovereignty, and made the dawning-places of Thy Cause in Thy lands, the daysprings of Thy divine sustenance amongst Thy creatures, and the manifestations of Thy lordship between Thy heaven and Thy earth. Thou art, verily, the Powerful over what Thou willest, and the Dominant over what Thou desirest. None can resist Thy command or reverse Thy decree. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou desirest by Thy will. Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the Giver, the Bountiful, the Beloved, the Generous.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the oceans of Thy names surged in the kingdom of Thy attributes, and the sun of Thy decree shone forth from the horizon of Thy judgment, to gather these beneath the shade of the tree of Thy oneness. Then grant them, O my God, from the wonders of Thy bounties which Thou hast sent down at all times from the heaven of Thy will and concealed from the eyes of Thy creatures, that they may delight in secret as they have delighted openly in the wondrous gifts of Thy divine unity. Send down, O my Beloved, into their hearts that which will purify them from all else but Thee and draw them near to the sanctuary of Thy good-pleasure and the source of Thy will, that they may speak naught except in Thy love, turn to none save in devotion to Thee, face no direction but the direction of Thy mercy and bounty, raise not their hands save toward the heaven of Thy might and generosity, and open not their eyes save unto the wondrous splendors of the lights of Thy countenance.\n\nO Beloved! Give them to drink from the cups of everlasting life by the hand of this Youth in this paradise, that they may be severed from the idols of Satan and unite in Thy Cause in these days, remembering Thee at eventide and at dawn beneath the canopy of Thy grace, O Thou Bestower! O Thou Who sendeth down the Revelation, and bringeth the contingent world into being! I beseech Thee, O my Beloved, to remove discord from among these, then clothe them in the robe of Thy grace and the garments of Thy favors, in such wise that they may speak only of the wondrous traces of Thy divine sovereignty, and there may appear from them naught but that which will guide all created things to the court of Thy holy love, whereby the servants may ascend to the atmosphere of nearness to Thy unity, rise unto the heaven of Thy uniqueness, gather in the precincts of Thy mercy, and be as one soul before the sanctuary of Thy grandeur.\n\nThen I beseech Thee, O my God, to purify their hearts from the dust of contingent things and the soil of created things, that the mirrors of their hearts may be cleansed and there may be reflected therein the wondrous splendors of the lights of Thy luminous beauty. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and verily, Thou art wise over all things.\n\nBless, then, O my God, those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs and in Thy Beauty which shineth between Thy earth and Thy heaven. Thou art, verily, the Lord of forgiveness and mercy, and the Lord of grandeur and majesty. Then, O my God, detach Thy servants from all else but Thee and draw them to the court of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Resurrector, the Life-Giver, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\n=== END BH00915 ===\n\n=== START BH00916 ===\n\nIn the name of Him Who is the Manifest, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art He Who created all beings through the force of Thy Self-Subsistence, and manifested all things through the power of Thy Unity. Thou hast clothed them with the garments of Thy all-knowledge and adorned them with the robes of Thy holiness, that all might testify to Thy eternal sovereignty in the realm of divine essences, and all might bear witness to Thy singular dominion in the world of contingent beings. Thou hast made the Point of Existence the essence of all knowledge in the dawning of creation, and hast stripped away all signs, such that no mention was ordained for aught else in His presence, nor any glory for another in His kingdom. Thou didst ordain no separation between them, no connection, no mention, and no description, lest any soul be veiled by beholding created things from attaining unto the beauty of Thy countenance, and lest any being be kept back, at the manifestation of known things, from gazing upon Thy majesty.\n\nGlorified, glorified art Thou above the knowledge of all known things! Glorified, glorified art Thou beyond the description of all created things! By Thy glory, O my Lord, were all names in their fullness and all attributes in their grandeur to be bestowed upon any sign of Thy dominion, it would be fitting, though nothing would be manifested therefrom throughout all eternity, nor would a single letter emerge from the veils of majesty. Glorified, glorified art Thou! How great is Thy power, how mighty Thy sovereignty, whereby Thou hast made all existence the dawning-place of Thy knowledge and the treasury of Thy glory!\n\nBy Thy life! Should any of those who point unto Thee desire to bring forth all knowledge from a speck of dust, he would be able, for the sovereign power of Thy grace hath permeated the mystery of unity, and the king of Thy bounty hath stirred within the innermost essence of eternity. All this is but a token of the knowledge whereby Thou didst create all visible things and bring forth all that hath been mentioned, without anything departing from or entering into the sign of Thy unity. But the knowledge that is Thy Self none shall ever know save Thee, and none can describe it except Thee. It hath no description save its own essence, no mention save its own being, no attribute save its own self. Glorified, glorified art Thou far above whatsoever Thy servants assert in describing Thy attributes!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! I know not how to make mention of Thee after Thou hast cut off all ways before me and encompassed me from every direction. Yet how can I refrain from mentioning Thee after Thou hast commanded me by the sovereign power of Thy remembrance and guided me by the king of Thy loving-kindness? By Thy glory, O my Beloved! I desire none but Thee, I describe none but Thee, I seek none but Thee, I ask for none but Thee, and I exist solely for Thee, and through none but Thee.\n\nBy Thy glory, which is Thy very Self! Were I not fearful lest the feet of them that know Thee might slip and the minds of the united ones be confounded, I would have declared Thee sanctified above all things, hallowed beyond every description, and would have returned all the attributes wherewith people describe Thee to a speck of dust, that the sovereignty of Thy might might become manifest in the realm of divine essences and the king of Thy transcendence might be proven in the kingdom of unity. But how can this be, after Thou hast sealed my tongue by Thy power? And how can this appear, after Thou hast removed me far by Thy might?\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! Thou art He Who seated me within the pavilions of Thy grandeur, then took away their pillars; Who caused me to dwell in the tabernacle of Thy loftiness, then cut its cords. Praise be to Thee, O my God, for what Thou hast sent down upon Thy servant from the drops of Thy might, and thanksgiving be to Thee, O my Hope, for what Thou hast caused to descend upon this son of Thy handmaiden from the outpourings of Thy power, such that the signs of Thy wrath have encompassed me from every direction.\n\nNone shall be able to withstand me in the face of the manifestation of the signs of Thy wrath, nor can any soul endure to be with me at the revelation of the tokens of Thy chastisement. Glorified, glorified art Thou! How great is my grief, and how severe my tribulation, that even wert Thou to seat me upon the throne of glory and give me to drink from the chalices of oneness before the countenance of beauty, and conceal me in the robes of grace behind the tabernacles of might and bounty, and cause me to enter the pavilions of grandeur at the dawning of the sun of eternity - by Thy glory, the sorrow of my heart would not be dispelled, nor would the anguish of my soul be lifted, nor would the burning of my heart be stilled, nor would the grief of my being be extinguished. I know not, O my God, why Thou hast caused to remain on earth one whom no created thing desireth, and how Thou hast delivered unto the kingdom one whom no creature loveth. Glorified, glorified art Thou! Never have I found any as patient as Thee, nor known any as forsaken as I. Yet by Thy glory, even if Thou wert to slay me with every sword, and pierce my heart with every arrow, and raise my head upon every spear, and parade it throughout the lands until the people do with it as they wish - I would remain content with Thy decree, obedient to Thy command, accepting of Thy deeds, and loving what Thou lovest. It is not for me to object with a single word, for I, in my weakness and abasement, have known and become certain that Thou wilt not deal with me save in that which benefiteth me, and this is the ultimate expression of Thy grace toward Thy servant and the supreme manifestation of Thy loving-kindness toward the son of Thy handmaiden. But none can understand this save those whose vision Thou hast made penetrating this Day, and sufficient art Thou as witness to what I say. Glorified, glorified art Thou! Verily, I have been among the wrongdoers, and I call upon Thee in the darkness of remoteness that there is no God but Thee. Glory be unto Thee! Verily, I am of those who repent. Answer Thou my prayer and have mercy upon me, for Thou art the Beloved of them that know Thee, and praise be unto Thee, for Thou art God, the Lord of all worlds. Dost Thou see within Thyself, O my God, that Thou shouldst not have mercy upon me, after I have become certain that Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful? Dost Thou perceive in Thy inner being, O my Lord, that Thou shouldst not gladden me, after I have known that Thou art the Lord of all worlds? Glorified art Thou, O my God! If Thou art not with Thy servant, who then can be his companion? And if Thou art not with the son of Thy handmaiden, can any other than Thee be his reckoner? Nay, by Thy presence! For by the power of Thy grace Thou hast cut him off from all directions, and by the sovereignty of Thy mercy Thou hast sanctified him from all contingent things, whether this be in opposition to his self or in accordance with it, such that nothing remaineth for him save the dawning-places of Thy remembrance and the manifestations of Thy praise. If Thou acceptest these, then unto Thee be praise - praise that causeth grace to descend from the heavens of Thine eternity, praise that manifesteth tenderness from the splendors of Thine essence, praise that befitteth the sovereignty of Thy oneness and beseemeth the dominion of Thy unity. Glorified, glorified art Thou! Verily, I have been among the heedless, and I say: Have mercy upon me, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00916 ===\n\n=== START BH00917 ===\n\nBeloved spiritual one, his honor Nabil-ibn-Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God and His care! He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!\n\nIn truth, the praise of these servants has not been and is not worthy of the Concealed Mystery, the Hidden Secret, and the Protected Symbol. The path to the impenetrable Mystery is blocked and the quest rejected. However, praise, gratitude, mention and glorification are befitting of Him Who stands in the place of Truth, glorified be His Glory. He is the Dawning-Place of supreme attributes and the Dayspring of the Most Beautiful Names. This most exalted station and loftiest summit and ultimate goal ended with the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. He is the Seal through whom the Beginning was made manifest, and He is the Last through whom the First became evident. He is the Manifestation of 'He doeth what He willeth' and the Embodiment of the words 'He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden.' And prayers and peace be upon Him and His family and companions through whom the banner of unity was unfurled and the decree of detachment was spread.\n\nThereafter, O beloved of my heart, the esteemed letter which was sent to the great beloved, His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be God's peace and care, was forwarded to this servant and presented before His face. He said: \"Excellent is what his tongue hath spoken and what hath flowed from his utterance. He hath indeed spoken the truth. We beseech God the Exalted to strengthen him and assist him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to protect him from the evil of those who have clung to the cord of deceit and guile. Verily, He is powerful over all things. And We make mention of those with him. We beseech God to send down upon them a blessing from His presence and mercy from His side. He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\" End.\n\nAs for that beloved one's augury, in truth it was a supreme sign and a mighty proof. But what benefit when there is no fairness and penetrating vision and attentive ears are lacking - nay, lost. We are God's and unto Him shall we return. However, what he said afterward and declared that \"I took an augury from them and this verse came\" - this statement was pure fabrication. In any case, Ahmad is very corrupting. That beloved one should know that he may often become the cause of sedition and corruption, for in his childhood things were observed from him. It is not known by what proof and evidence those souls accepted the Primal Point. The essence of the Bayan, by the confirmation of the Point Himself, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him, was this blessed word: \"I have written a gem concerning His mention, and it is that He shall not be known by My allusion nor by what is mentioned in the Bayan.\" If this mention were removed from the Bayan, nothing would remain. The second Yahya surely wants to become a follower of the first Yahya. Say: O helpless one! What was the outcome of the deeds and the fruits of the words and beliefs of the Shi'ihs of Iran that you now wish to follow them? After twelve hundred years, when He Whom they mentioned in nights and days and Whose appearance they sought and hoped for, both learned and ignorant, after His manifestation they arose to oppose Him and gave verdict to shed His most pure blood. And if only they had been aware of the source of vain imaginings. If this evanescent servant were to mention the details, all would be astonished. In any case, I beseech the Truth to grant eyes the light and ears the power of hearing that perchance they may see. Let them hear that verily He is in need of nothing from among all things, neither any mention from among mentions, nor any matter from among matters. He hath spoken with supreme steadfastness before the faces of humanity. What He hath willed - verily He is the One Willed in both beginning and end, and He stood before all faces while those who indulge in vain imaginings remained behind the veil. That beloved one, praise be to God, is aware and cognizant. According to His command, shunning such souls is necessary and withholding acknowledgment obligatory. Often they inform the heedless and investigators appear. Under no circumstances should you be at ease with anyone. There have been and are investigators among the people; one cannot be at ease with any soul, for they conduct their investigations with the utmost friendship and unity. Since that beloved one has the affairs of the people in hand, they must be most vigilant. The polytheistic souls will surely give information to others. In correspondence also, wisdom must be observed. Until now they have not understood the purpose, imagining that this party consists of corrupt people. I beseech the Truth to make all on earth aware, that they may know with clear certitude that corruption, conflict, contention, treachery and all evil deeds have been forbidden with a mighty forbidding, and the purpose hath been and is naught but reformation. As they are heedless and unaware, at the mere hearing of a word they become agitated. In all cases that beloved one must be vigilant and documents must be in a secure place. The servant beseecheth his Lord to preserve you, guard you, aid you in wisdom, ordain for you the good of this world and the next, and manifest through you that which shall endure through the eternity of His most beautiful Names.\n\nConvey my greetings to the spiritual friend, his eminence Shaykh, upon him be God's peace and favors, and likewise to Qurratu'l-'Ayn. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for confirmation and aid for each one. Verily He hath power over all things. Convey my greetings and praise to his eminence \\[the namesake\\], upon him be God's peace and favors. He too must act with wisdom, for some people are corrupt and have neither recognized nor known the worth of generosity, love, manliness and valor. In all cases one must hold fast to wisdom. Verily He is the Preserver, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nConcerning what was written about his honor Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Akbar, may God assist and aid him, this servant conveys greetings to him and beseeches the Truth to preserve him and grant him sustenance from the purest fountain. Ghouls and demons lie in wait in ambush. I beseech and implore the Truth not to deprive the seekers from the ultimate goal and highest purpose, nor prevent the yearning ones from the effulgences of the Sun of inner meanings. Blessed is the day and mighty the Cause, while the helpless people are heedless and unaware. It is hoped that the true Bestower will not withhold His grace but grant that which befits His generosity. Verily He is the Kind, the Generous. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you, upon those with you, and upon God's sincere servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n12 Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1303\n\n=== END BH00917 ===\n\n=== START BH00918 ===\n\nHe is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing!\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the Wronged One to him who hath witnessed and beheld the greatest signs of his Lord, and hath attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is he who hath known that for which he was created, and happy is he who hath clung to the cord of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We have seen it and heard what was therein. We have answered thee with a Tablet through which the Herald hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.\n\nO Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thy call hath reached Mine ears and thy letter hath come before Mine eyes. Verily thy Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer. Remember thou the days when thou didst stand before the face of thy Lord and wert seated before His mighty throne. Thou art he who heard the Call and turned unto the Supreme Horizon, and drank the choice wine of understanding from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Gracious. There hath been ordained for thee from the Pen of the Most High that which the world cannot equal. Thus hath the Wronged One given thee glad-tidings in His Most Great Prison, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. When thou hast received My Tablet and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the chalice of My words, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having drawn me nigh unto Thee, and brought me into Thy presence, and honored me with meeting Thee, and given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance, and made known to me Thy momentous Message and Thy straight Path. I am he who, O my God, was heedless - the revelations of Thy loving-kindness taught me; who was asleep - the hand of Thy bounty awakened me; who was far removed - the manifestations of Thy grace drew me nigh. How can I recount, O my God, the wondrous tokens of Thy loving-kindness and what Thou hast sent down to me from the heaven of Thy Will and the kingdom of Thy Purpose? The evidences of Thy Most Exalted Pen and Thy mercy that hath preceded all things have encompassed me, such that Thou hast made me one of the Afnans of Thy Tree and associated me with Thine own Self. By Thy glory! Were I to possess a thousand souls at every moment and sacrifice them all in Thy path, they would not equal a drop from the ocean of Thy bounty nor a spark from the fire of the Tree of Thy Cause. O Lord! Aid me to remember Thee and praise Thee and serve Thy chosen ones. By Thy glory, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! I desire that Thou make me, in all conditions, attracted by Thy verses, illumined by Thy light, clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace, and gazing toward Thy horizon, and to be in such wise that nothing in the world, neither strength nor power nor dominion, shall hold me back. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. I beseech Thee, O Manifestation of clear signs and Revealer of verses, by Thy Most Holy Book and what it containeth of Thy mysteries and knowledge, and by the suns of love and fellowship that have shone forth from the horizons of the hearts of them that are sincere among Thy servants, to ordain for me that which shall protect me from those who have violated Thy Covenant, and disbelieved in Thy proof, and disputed Thy verses, and denied Thy right. O Lord! Thou seest me humble before Thy face and submissive to Thy command. Ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of all men and the Lord of the mighty Throne and the exalted Seat.\n\nO Afnan! The upheaval in this land has caused the delay in reply. From the earliest days until now, the Wronged One has been in the hands of enemies. Although the might, majesty and power of the peoples of the world have not and will never prevent the penetration of the Most Exalted Word and the power of the Most High Pen, yet since being wronged has been and is acceptable in the sight of God, therefore He has been made the target of the transgressions of the oppressors and aggressors. In the transformation of the prison into the Most Exalted Paradise there are signs for the discerning and evidences for those of insight. That which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in the Tablets hath been and continueth to be made manifest. We beseech God to aid thee to do that which is pleasing unto the Friend. Some of the Afnan, upon them be the Glory of the All-Merciful, circle round and abide in peace and tranquility beneath the canopy of grandeur. The Command is in His hand; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nRegarding what thou didst mention about the afflictions of the people and their lack of awareness, what hath befallen and continueth to befall the people of the earth is the recompense of their deeds. Man and all things are bewildered. A group throughout ages and centuries cried out \"O Qa'im!\" and finally martyred Him. O Afnan! One day as We were walking in the land of Ta, the seat of Persian sovereignty, suddenly lamentations arose from all directions. Upon investigation, the wailing of pulpits throughout the cities and regions of that land was heard, uttering these words: \"O my God, my God! The Seal of the Prophets and the Lord of all Messengers, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, ordained us for Thy mention and praise. The purpose was that through us Thy mention, Thy praise and the praise of Thy loved ones might be raised. Yet now the ignorant ones are engaged in cursing and reviling the Intended One. O my God, my God! Deliver us and protect us from the idolatrous souls.\" In response to these exalted words, there was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of Names: \"Verily We have accepted tribulations for the manifestation of the Cause and We are patient therein. He verily is the Concealer. He biddeth you to observe sublime concealment. He is the All-Patient. He counseleth you to show forth beauteous patience.\"\n\nO Afnan! Not a single pulpit remained in Iran except that upon it God, exalted be His glory, was reviled, and that was uttered which is forbidden to mention. Had not God's mercy preceded, all would have perished. Two things have caused preservation: one, divine forgiveness, and the other, the deeds of certain souls who claimed to be related to the Truth. We beseech God to awaken those who slumber and illumine those who are heedless with the light of wisdom. He is the Mighty, the Powerful. We supplicate the Goal of all the worlds to aid thee and thy kindred to achieve that whose fragrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.\n\nMention of the honored Afnan who was named Muhammad-i-Qablih-Baqir hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. He hath attained unto My remembrance, which hath been inscribed in God's Book by the Ancient Pen. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The Glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. The honored Amin hath ever made mention of thee and the Afnan. Each of the letters that he hath sent to this Servant hath been adorned with mention of the Afnan. Now We have turned Our attention in that direction, and therefore We make mention of him with a wondrous mention, that it may draw him and My Afnans unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Today the fragrance of the Revelation hath encompassed the world, yet most are deprived. We beseech God that He may assist His loved ones to achieve that which beseemeth the Day of God. In any case, convey the mention of the Wronged One to Amin wherever he may be, that he may rejoice and be numbered among the thankful ones.\n\n=== END BH00918 ===\n\n=== START BH00919 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power!\n\nPraise befitteth the most holy court of the Desired One, Who hath transformed the Most Great Prison for His loved ones - though it beareth this name - and hath thrown open the gate of attainment unto His presence. As a manifestation of His power, He hath also unlocked the outer gate in such wise that it remaineth continuously open day and night, that whosoever willeth may enter and whosoever wisheth may depart - this, in spite of those who, upon our first arrival, had barred the gate of the barracks which was the abode of prisoners. Therefore did the Tongue of Utterance proclaim in one instance these words: \"Grieve not, for God shall soon open before your faces the gate of the city. Then shall enter and leave through it whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Desired One.\" Yet now, for some time, expressions of sadness have been emanating from this land. The knowledge thereof is with God, the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest the hearts of Thy Afnan turning toward the horizon of Thy Cause, gazing upon the lights of Thy countenance, awaiting the wonders of Thy grace, set ablaze with the fire of Thy love, and attracted by Thy verses. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and the Possessor of power over all nations, by the call of the Daysprings of Thy Cause and the Fountainheads of Thy wisdom amongst Thy servants, and by Thy Book whereby Thou didst separate truth from error and didst guide all unto Thy path, to adorn them with the crown of Thy Name amidst Thy creation and with the ornament of Thy Revelation throughout Thy lands. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy bounty blessings and mercy from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all names. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Dominant, the Almighty.\n\nMy soul be a sacrifice for your arising, your remembrance and your utterance! The letter from your eminence, which shone with love and favor, arrived, illuminating the court of the heart and bestowing eternal fragrance and joy upon the carpet of the soul. Praise be to God, each of its letters and words was a messenger arriving from the city of recognition, and a herald from the realm of utterance bearing endless glad tidings, for from each letter wafted the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. We praise God for confirming His Afnan in His remembrance and praise, in circumambulating His House, and in arising to serve His Cause. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nAfter its reading, recognition and perusal, it was taken to the Holy Presence and achieved the honor of being heard. The Lord, may our souls be a sacrifice for Him, said: \"O servant present! Behold the grace of God and His sovereignty. He hath confirmed the Afnan in turning towards Him, in acceptance, in steadfastness and certitude, and hath made them guides to His remembrance among His servants. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to strengthen His Cause through them among His creation and to aid them in exalting His Word throughout all regions. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. And We send Our greetings to Our loved ones there and ask for them divine confirmation and success in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\"\n\nPraise be to God, there hath flowed from the Source of grace that of which a single drop causeth the sprouting of the world with the herbs of wisdom and utterance, and the flowers of remembrance and knowledge. Exalted is God's grace and magnificent His bounty, and resplendent the Sun of His mercy which hath preceded all created things. The loved ones and friends in that land are each blessed with His grace and are specially mentioned in that Presence, particularly the honored servant Haji Muhammad-Rida and the beloved of the heart Muhammad-Mu??afa, upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. This servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His loved ones through the angels of His victory, to ordain for them what He hath revealed in His Book, and to grant them the Kawthar of nearness and attainment in the Day which all have been promised - the Day whose advent He announced to the polytheists and whose coming He heralded to the monotheists. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nIt is submitted that the petition of Bahram, upon him be the Glory of God, which he presented to your honor, was entirely presented. Grace and bounty were shown towards him, and then these blessed words were uttered: \"O Bahram! The dawn of the Day of Justice hath broken. The rays of the all-encompassing Sun have illumined the world and bestowed freshness upon the withered age. How excellent is the eye that seeth and recognizeth! Ask thou the Self-Sufficient One to reveal unto thee the mystery of His Day and grant thee new life upon new life. He is the Mighty, He is the All-Knowing.\"\n\nPraise be to God! The beloved of the heart, his honor Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors and bounties, has been with them and has mentioned each one. The noble scribes are present everywhere - this is from God's command, the Mighty, the Loving. Hidden particles are revealed and concealed mysteries are made manifest. This is the Day when secrets are tried. How clearly the secrets of hearts and the betrayal of eyes were revealed at the Threshold! This is a promise that cannot be denied. Praise be to God, we witnessed it, yet in all conditions we beseech Him to make the heedless aware and grant the sinners the grace to return. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Generous.\n\nThe letter arrived late and there was no opportunity to present the response to the beloved of the heart, his honor the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, the True, the Manifest King. God willing, I shall present it later. I convey greetings and praise, and beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, for confirmation and success on his behalf. Praise be to God, he is successful and what was sent has arrived. It is known that his honor is steadfast in service in all conditions and mindful of the interests of the Cause. This is a confirmation from God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of our forefathers.\n\nThe Branches of the Blessed Tree and the maidens of the pavilion of chastity each mention his honor and that honored Afnan, and beseech God for confirmation and success. The honored one, the beloved spiritual one concealed in this evanescent heart, his honor Afnan Haji Siyyid Ali, may my spirit be sacrificed for him and upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, has always been and continues to be remembered, mentioned and present. The servant beseeches his Lord to unite you time after time and again and again. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nPraise, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and earth.\n\nThe Servant\n\n19 Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1306\n\nThe matter of the earth-moving equipment may be presented later.\n\n=== END BH00919 ===\n\n=== START BH00920 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory and power!\n\nPraise, sanctified above all change and extinction, eternally was and ever shall be befitting and worthy of that Imperishable Being, that Self-Sufficient Most High, Who through the fragrance of the garment of His grace guided the people of the Kingdom of Creation to the Most Exalted Horizon, and by the scratching of His Pen drew the peoples of the world to the Kingdom of Eternity. He bestowed upon the atom the glory of the sun, and conferred upon the drop the effects of the ocean. By His Command-Word He subdued the world, and by a single letter from His Book He guided those endowed with understanding to the fountain of life. He is the Peerless Mighty One and the King Who doeth what He willeth. All the peoples of the world bear witness to His power. The might of oppressors, the tyranny of aggressors, the denial of deniers, and the turning away of the heedless did not and will never prevent Him from His purpose. His Will is operative and His Purpose all-pervasive. His blessed Name is the Most Great Healing Medicine for the health of the world, and His mention the companion of every stranger and wanderer. Exalted be His mercy and glorified be His grace. There is none other God but Him.\n\nAnd peace and blessings be upon Him Who sat upon the Throne of the Seal, through Whom appeared the decree of the Beginning, whereby was broken the back of the wicked ones who worshipped idols and took them as lords besides God, the Lord of all mankind, and upon His family and companions who arose to serve His Cause and strove in God's path to exalt His Word - they are honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who act by His command.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the Tree spoke forth on the Mount of Recognition and the lights of the Sun of Thy countenance shone forth from the horizon of creation! I beseech Thee by the dawning-places of Thy Most Beautiful Names and the day-springs of Thy most exalted attributes, and by Thy Greatest Signs, to send down upon Thy servants that which will draw them to Thine All-Highest Horizon and bring them near unto Thee, O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of earth below. O Lord! The souls have been enveloped by the veils of idle fancies and been prevented from turning to the horizon of certitude. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by Thy Name the Self-Subsisting, to assist Thy loved ones to stand firm in Thy Cause and to write down for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit them in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! Disappoint them not of what lies with Thee, and withhold not from them that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee and such of Thy creatures as are sincere before Thee. O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward Thee, facing the lights of Thy countenance, and hastening toward the ocean of Thy bounty. Do Thou provide them, O my God, with the table Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy grace and the blessings Thou hast ordained in Thy Scrolls and Books and Tablets. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nAnd further: your letter was received, and the fragrance of acceptance and love emanated from it. Praise be to God, they are blessed with divine favors and honored by His name. This evanescent servant beseeches the Self-Sufficient Lord in all conditions to rend asunder the veils of all parties with the finger of power, so that all may arise, with illumined vision, truthful tongues, attentive ears, pure hearts, and expanded breasts, to that which befits the station of man. Man has been and continues to be among the greatest signs of God, and has come from the realm of non-existence into the court of existence for the knowledge and betterment of the world. Should the leaders of government and nation manifest spiritual virtues, goodly deeds, and kindly words, the lights of justice would encompass all the earth, and all would dwell in perfect tranquility within the pavilion of security and peace. The foundation of the security and welfare of nations rests upon two pillars: reward and punishment. Every sovereign must implement these two principles; indeed it is essential. If man observes the divine verses with the eye of fairness and reflects, he will find each passage to be the dawning-place of laws. Reflect upon this blessed verse wherein He says: \"Accept thou what is easy, and enjoin what is just, and turn away from the ignorant.\" And likewise He says: \"Be generous as God has been generous to thee.\" All laws and principles that are the cause of the world's order and the nations' tranquility can be deduced and derived from these two blessed verses. Most of the servants are seen to be heedless and veiled, and this servant, in view of the degrees of love and affection, is at all times engaged in prayer and clinging to the hem of divine generosity, that He might perchance not look upon the deeds of the servants, but rather, through His own bounty and grace, grant what has been beseeched. Verily He is the Forgiving, verily He is the Kind, verily He is the Generous, verily He is the Merciful. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nAnd regarding the question about the blessed verse concerning the Trust - His exalted Word: \"We offered the Trust\" - a detailed response was bestowed, but sending it in an envelope was far from the requirements of wisdom, therefore it was not sent. God willing, in these days perhaps someone will journey in that direction and it will be sent with them. Now this servant has given the glad tidings of it and afterward you shall attain it. You mentioned his honor Akhund Mulla Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God. God willing, may he be blessed in all conditions with the outpourings of the true Bestower and illumined by the lights of the Sun of inner meanings. The world has never had, nor has, any worth - soon it shall return to nothingness. I beseech and implore God to aid His loved ones in that which will cause their names and mention to endure. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the Kingdom of Names. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Wise. This evanescent servant sends greetings to his honor the aforementioned one. God willing, may he be assisted in the remembrance of God and in that which will exalt the station of man in the contingent world. Likewise convey greetings and praise from this servant to his honor Karbala'i Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God. I hope from God's generosity, exalted be His glory, that He will protect him in all conditions through the hands of power and grant him that which befits His bounty. Verily He is the Generous, the Merciful. Convey greetings and praise from this evanescent one to the other friends in that land. God willing, may all be aided and assisted in that which God loves and with which He is pleased. Peace and glory be upon you and upon those who have testified to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth, that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And peace and blessings be upon the Messengers, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00920 ===\n\n=== START BH00921 ===\n\nHis honor Mirza Habibullah, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\n\nA mention from Us to one who has turned towards and heard the Call of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, and answered his Lord on a day wherein most of mankind turned away from the Lord of the Beginning and the End. To this My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness as it speaketh from the prison: \"There is none other God but I, the True One, the Knower of things unseen.\" Blessed art thou for having turned towards God and acted according to that which thou wert commanded by God, the Mighty, the Loving. We bear witness that thou hast cast aside what thou didst desire and taken what God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, did desire. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in My path. There hath befallen Us that which hath befallen no other servants. To this the Tongue of God beareth witness from His praiseworthy station.\n\nO Habib! Rejoice in that the All-Forgiving hath forgiven thee and purified thee from transgressions. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate. He hath seized the spotted one with His might and left him beneath the lashes of his reprehensible and abhorrent deeds. He was indeed the foundation and source of corruption. We unleashed upon him, before the Hereafter, a punishment in this world from which the denizens of the fire seek refuge with God, the Powerful, the Mighty. The breezes of chastisement encompassed him from all directions, both before and after his soul's departure. The angels of wrath drove him to the lowest of the low. We seize with justice and give through grace, and I am the Just, the Wise. He taketh and causeth grief; He giveth and bringeth joy; and He is the Kind, the Merciful. Justice hath its hosts, which are the requital and recompense of deeds, and through these the pavilion of order hath been raised in the world, and every transgressor hath taken hold of his own reins through fear of retribution. Thus hath spoken the Lord of Names; He is verily the Speaker, the All-Knowing. And We seized the wolf with an affliction which none save God, the Lord of all worlds, hath knowledge of. This occurred in the first year he opposed My Name, the Ha. Verily thy Lord is the Severe Avenger. By My life! No medicine shall cure him, nor shall anything in the kingdom of creation heal him. It shall increase and not diminish until he returneth to his abode. Then shall he behold what neither mention can reckon nor any counter enumerate. And before him We seized the Chief through Our power, even as We seized those greater than he in bygone ages, and I am the Expositor, the All-Informed.\n\nO Habib! Thy letter hath come and hath attained unto the hearing of thy Lord in this station wherein the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary speaketh amongst mankind: \"The Lord of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty.\" We found in thy letter the warmth of thy love and witnessed thy being set ablaze by that Word whereby the hearts of those near unto God were enkindled. Rejoice thou in that the Wronged One hath mentioned thee while sorrows encompassed Him from those who were heedless of this mighty Cause.\n\nAnd We make mention of the Sheikh who was named Hassan that he may rejoice in a remembrance whereby all things were attracted and every possessor of utterance proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\" Give thanks unto God for having remembered thee with verses that cannot be equaled by what the eyes of the world have seen nor the treasuries of kings. Be thou vocal in My remembrance, soaring in My atmosphere, and steadfast in the service of My Cause, the Unshakeable, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me that which the learned and divines of the age have not attained unto, save him whom Thou didst rescue through the arm of Thy power. I testify that Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\"\n\nHappy is the eye that hath seen My signs, and the ear that hath heard My call, and the heart that hath turned toward My horizon, and the tongue that hath uttered My beauteous praise. O My loved ones! Drink ye from the Kawthar of life everlasting in My Name and sprinkle thereof upon every mouldering bone. By God! The very rock crieth out in ecstasy at the verses of its Lord, and the mountain soareth in its longing to attain the presence of God, the All-Speaking, the Witness, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones in Mim before Alif and Za', and remind them of the verses of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens, that the rapture of thy call may draw them to a station wherein the Tongue of Eternity proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Be thankful unto God for having remembered you while He was imprisoned by those who were heedless of the Beginning and the Return. We counsel you to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. Beware lest the doubts of the people keep you back from the Name of the Self-Subsisting. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are bidden by God, the Lord of all men. This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone - to this do God's Books, the Lord of lords, bear witness. From this spot We send Our greetings upon your faces and upon the faces of those who have turned with radiant countenances toward the countenance of their Lord, the Dayspring of lights.\n\nWe make mention of My handmaidens in that place who have quaffed the wine of My loving-kindness, who have turned toward My horizon and who have spoken My praise on a Day wherein the heaven brought forth smoke. O My handmaidens! Rejoice that the countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward you from the direction of His Most Great Prison. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Glory be upon you and upon those handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling.\n\nWe make mention of My servant Ghulam-'Ali and give him the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness and mercy, that he may give thanks unto his Gracious Lord. We have remembered thee out of Our grace, and We are the All-Knowing Rememberer. We have turned toward thee, and We are the Merciful Turner. O Ghulam! Turn thy face toward thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having remembered me and accepted my turning toward Thy luminous horizon. Thanks be unto Thee, O my God, for having acquainted me with the ocean of Thy knowledge while He was in His mighty prison. I beseech Thee to ordain for me and for Thy loved ones, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, that which Thou hast ordained for Thy sincere ones. All praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nWe make mention in this station of My loved ones in Qaf and Mim, and We remember them with that which diffuseth the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Wise. O My loved ones! The Best-Beloved remembereth you in the land of exile while imprisoned by the hands of the heedless. Blessed are ye for having turned toward the Countenance, and joy be unto you for having won the grace of God, the Bestower, the Gracious. Arise with such steadfastness as shall cause the hearts of the polytheists to tremble - they who claim allegiance to the Bayan yet deny Him Who revealed it by His command. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are among the dead. Rejoice ye in My remembrance, then speak forth My praise, and when a clamorer cometh unto you, leave him to himself and turn ye toward the Most Sublime Horizon - the station wherefrom the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha was raised in celebration of this Remembrance, whereof God gave glad-tidings through the tongues of the Prophets and Messengers. Glory be from Us upon those who have acknowledged this Momentous News.\n\n=== END BH00921 ===\n\n=== START BH00922 ===\n\nHis Holiness Ali-Qabl-i-Asghar, whose brother was martyred in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nHe is the Ever-Abiding, the All-Knowing in the Kingdom of Eternity. Glorified be He Whom all that are in the heavens and earth do praise, and verily He encompasseth all things. Before Him bow down all who dwell in the dominion of creation and command, and verily He hath power over all things. He hath ordained the measures of all things in the Tablets and made clear unto His servants that which draweth them nigh unto the Beauty of wondrous glory. He hath sent down from the heaven of command the verses of grandeur and might, and made them a proof from Him unto all the worlds. He hath sent forth the Messengers testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that this Youth is His splendor and His glory and His grandeur unto all who are in the heavens and the earth. Thus hath God testified with the tongue of power and might, and verily He is witness unto all things.\n\nAmong them is he whose heart He inspired through the Spirit of Truth, and among them is he upon whom revelation descended with hidden holy intimations, and among them is he upon whom the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a perfect angel, and among them is he with whom God conversed directly without mention of any other, when separation vanished and the Sovereign of union appeared without sign or condition. And among them is he whom He caused to speak of Himself unto Himself, making him sanctified from the confirmation of aught else. Exalted be this bounty which every pure mystic is powerless to comprehend! Whoso claimeth to know this station hath indeed lied against himself and is recorded among the calumniators in the Tablets of Protection.\n\nThat which is attributed to Him of the confirmations of the Spirit is only due to the weakness of the servants, for verily He hath ever been independent of all the worlds. Verily the Holy Spirit confirmeth by His command, and the Spirit of the Cause circleth round about Him. This is the foundation of the Cause, spoken by the tongue of manifest truth. Say: God hath made all words a throne for His Word, whereupon it was established upon the thrones with a sovereignty mighty over the Cause. Say: The sovereignty of words hath been established upon their seats, and none knoweth this save he who hath turned with pure and illumined vision unto that which hath been sent down from the direction of the Throne.\n\nSay: When the beauty of the veiled, concealed, and hidden meanings was revealed in this luminous, conclusive Word upon the Sinai of utterances between earth and heaven, then were the words of the people of allusions struck down, and they fell prostrate upon the dust, returning to a station that was limited from the beginning. Thus came the Lord of Words upon clouds of meaning, and the Cause was determined by the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, those who denied it are removed from divine wrath and are slaves to the idols of self and passion, and their names are not mentioned today before the Throne.\n\nSay: O people, adorn yourselves with the raiment of righteousness and piety between earth and heaven. This We have ordained for you in the Kingdom of Eternity from the mercy which preceded all the worlds. By God, O people, the ocean of grandeur hath surged in My Most Glorious Name at the Dayspring of Light from this brilliant, luminous Light, while ye remain halted in drunkenness at the setting-place of extinction. Hasten ye to the paradise of God and His mercy, for verily His mercy hath ever encompassed His grace. Say: The Beauty of God hath shone forth above your heads - do ye deny your vision of it? Then do the eyes of My mercy weep for you in this station which hath been praised throughout all eternity. Open \\[...\\]\n\nO people! We created hearts for the descent of the splendor of Our lights. Do you bar their doors against the face of their Lord, Who verily standeth behind the door and calleth you with a sorrowful voice, saying: \"O people! We created hearts for the descent of the effulgence of Our lights. Do ye bar their doors against the face of their Owner? This indeed is a grievous wrong in the Tablet. Purify My house from the mention of aught else but Me, that the lights of My manifestations may enter therein, for I will never gather with another, and I have ever been sanctified from all else besides Me. Thus hath it been inscribed by the Pen of Command in all the Tablets.\n\nO servant! Give thanks unto God for what hath been sent down unto thee--a Book that is noble in truth. Verily it is God's Scripture among the concourse of creation, the Book of Justice in the kingdom of names, and the mighty Book in the exalted heaven. Before the Throne it is named as a Tablet preserved by God's protection. None shall touch it save those whom God hath purified from the mention of all else but Him and raised them to the sublime summit of a holy and beloved station. Besides these, none shall attain unto it, even should they read it at all times. Thus hath the Command flowed from the direction of the All-Merciful, and the decree hath been sent down through grace from the clouds of this Cause.\n\nBlessed is he who findeth the sweetness of his Lord's remembrance in this Tablet and in whose heart is kindled the fire that was lit in the Tree of the All-Merciful by God's leave. O servant! Preserve this Tablet, then recite it in the gardens of Paradise that it may draw thee to a mighty and impregnable station.\n\nBeware, O people of Baha, lest ye hearken to the words of the idolaters concerning this Cause, nor sever the arm of grace with the swords of turning away. Soar with the two wings of detachment in this atmosphere. Then drink the sweet waters of inner meanings from the dawning-places of these words and say: \"Glory be to Him Who hath singled us out for the recognition of His Self, honored us with His love, and given us to drink of the water of life that was mingled with the love of God.\"\n\nThus have We taught thee the ways of truth, expounded the verses unto thee, and guided thee to the daybreak of guidance on this morn that hath shone forth from the brow of the Cause. May the mercy that hath appeared from the horizon of eternity be upon you, O people of Baha, and upon all who are with you, young and old.\n\nUnite, O loved ones of God, in His Cause, then follow God's ways and His religion, and be not tyrants and wretches in the earth. Say: Today none can enter God's Kingdom save by detaching themselves from all who are in the heavens and the earth and purifying themselves from the intimations of creation. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the direction of the Throne.\n\nAdorn yourselves with what God hath desired for you--this indeed is what is intended, did ye but know it. Stand firm in the love of God in these days when the thunderbolt of wrath hath seized all who are on earth save those who have entered beneath a shelter that is true and trustworthy. Thus hath the Spirit spoken upon the branches of the Tree of Knowledge, from One Who is mighty and praiseworthy.\n\nSay: Today nothing shall profit anyone except after having loved Me, and God is witness to what I say.\n\n=== END BH00922 ===\n\n=== START BH00923 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nThe Supreme Pen hath trembled by reason of this most grievous calamity which hath saddened the Wronged One whilst in this remote spot.

Make mention of him who turned towards the Most Great Prison, who circled round the Throne, and who sacrificed himself for God, the Lord of all worlds. He is now in the All-Glorious Horizon and the Supreme Companion, and was named Mahdi in the kingdom of creation - he who heard the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, who turned unto the Countenance, and who took hold of the Book with the power of God, the Sovereign Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nHe ascended unto God as a stranger and was buried in His vicinity, whereupon the Ocean of Pre-existence shed upon him that which the creatures are powerless to describe. To this beareth witness the Tongue of God, the Sovereign Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous. He quaffed the choice wine of life when it was unsealed by the hand of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and turned unto the Self-Subsisting when mankind was in great turmoil. He adorned himself with the raiment of certitude when people were in manifest doubt, and attained unto the Day of God, witnessed the Resurrection and its mysteries, and heard the call of the Wronged One from the horizon of His name, the Self-Subsisting. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe bear witness that he stood firm in the Cause when earthquakes seized all the tribes of the earth, and he witnessed, acknowledged, confessed and was assured of the Word whereby the backs of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, were broken. By God! He bore a Word which the dwellers of the heavens and earth were powerless to bear, save whom God willeth - the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of this noble station.\n\nWe have sanctified him, purified him, and cleansed him with the waters of the Kawthar of his Lord's mercy, the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous. By the life of God! None among the people recognized him except whom God pleased. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur make clear as a token of His grace.

By the life of God, verily He was alive in the Kingdom of God - He heareth and seeth, yet most of the people are heedless. \\[By God!\\] He hath adorned himself with the garment of immortality. And he who lamenteth for him hath not discovered the hidden, concealed, and treasured mysteries. Soon shall he behold his most exalted station and cry out: \"Blessed art thou, O thou who hast believed in Him through Whom the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken between earth and heaven, and the Spirit, the Faithful One, hath cried out: 'Praise be to God, the One, the Almighty, the All-Powerful!'\" Whoso seeth him in his station is bewildered and thunderstruck by the effulgent rays of that luminous station. By God! The people of Baha are not grieved by the assault of calamities nor by the hosts of the oppressors. They testify that death is truth and it draweth them nigh unto a station ordained for them by the Ordainer, the Ancient. Know ye, O people of Baha, that My grief is caused by the lamentation of My loved ones and the cry of My chosen ones; otherwise, by the life of God, We observe and rejoice in that the beloved hath ascended unto his Beloved, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Were the veil to be lifted, assuredly the hearts and souls would take flight unto the Supreme Companion. To this testifieth everyone who hath found the fragrance of the mysteries of his Lord, the Concealer, the Manifest, the Mighty, the Impregnable. We have not mentioned him because of his relation to Us, but because of his turning unto the horizon of Revelation and his facing the Countenance after the passing away of all things. Blessed is he who draweth nigh unto his dust and standeth at his grave and uttereth that which the Lote-Tree of the End hath spoken at this moment wherein the Wronged One walketh and the tongue speaketh and the Pen moveth by His decisive, wise command. Blessed is he, and blessed is the handmaiden who hath shown patience and been content with what hath been ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Informed.\n\nVerily the Tongue of the Ancient turneth toward the horizon of Thy grace and the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowal. Then remember his brother who was named 'Ali before Naqi, through that which floweth from the ocean of generosity, that the hearts of those whom sorrows have overtaken in this calamity may be gladdened - this calamity which hath caused the people of the pavilion of sinlessness to wail in this spot whereon the throne of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath been established. O My handmaidens! Be not grieved by the calamities of the world - they shall pass away and not endure. Rejoice in God's decree, for verily He commandeth what is right and acteth accordingly, as a grace from His presence. He is, verily, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nWe testify that he turned from the Land of Ha to the Ultimate Goal and the Most Glorious Horizon, and attained the presence of the Countenance, and heard the call of his Lord, the Most Exalted, with manifest joy. Blessed is he in that he acknowledged and confessed that which most of creation denied, and ascended unto God when the fragrance of his Lord's love, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Dear, the All-Encompassing, was diffused from his heart. This journey, which he achieved in his final days, profiteth him. By the life of God, this is a deed that adorneth every glorious tablet. We have forgiven him and adorned him with the ornament of his Lord's tender mercy, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Joy be unto him who remembereth him purely for the sake of God. He is of those who have attained unto the command of their Lord, the Commander, the Bestower, the Generous.

Were We to complain of anything, We would complain of Our life amidst My servants, yet We rejoice in Our concealment and Our manifestation from Mine horizon, and My dawning in one of My worlds, and My establishment upon Mine inner throne. Thus doth your Lord, the Ancient, the Everlasting, inform you. Then We make mention of the Leaf whose letter hath been presented before the Throne. Verily We make mention of her and her mother, even as We mentioned them in bygone years, as a grace from Our presence. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We bear witness that they both have attained unto turning towards God and drawing nigh unto Him, the Beloved of those who know. O Ocean of Utterance! Be still in thy place, for the people would be thunderstruck by thy waves. Take heed lest thou sprinkle upon them beyond their capacity to understand, and be forbearing with them.

Then thy letter arrived and was read before Our face in its entirety, and from it We perceived the fragrance of love, faithfulness, and steadfastness in the Cause of thy Lord, the Possessor of all Names. Therefore the Pen of loving-kindness was moved to make mention of unity, that thou mayest be assured that I am with you and you are with Me. We beseech God not to cause separation between Us and you, and to make us the helpers of His Cause in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nBy My life! This is the Day of steadfastness and faithfulness. Blessed is he who hath shone forth from their horizon with power and might. God willing, ye have ever been and will ever remain gazing toward the direction of the Most Great Scene and turning unto the lights of the countenance of the Lord of Power. Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds Who granted success enabling you to arise in His Cause and to drink from the chalice of tribulations in His path. The reward of those who have turned toward the Kaaba of His knowledge hath not been and will never be lost. And if, in association, some displeasure hath arisen for certain ones, it hath never been and is not ever considered, for in frequent association and companionship, sometimes weariness and sadness occur, but this is from the requirements of human nature. How could one look to these things after the atoms themselves bear witness that His mercy hath preceded all things and His grace hath encompassed the worlds?\n\nThe True One, exalted be His mention, hath called Himself the Forgiving, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the Generous. How then could He turn away from His loved ones for minor matters or withhold the glance of mercy? O Nabil-i-'Ali! By My life! He hath ever been, from the Most Exalted Perspective and Most Sublime Station, beholding naught but the good deeds of His loved ones and what hath befallen them in His path, passing over all else. This is what the Supreme Pen hath testified to in most of the Tablets. The Truth hath ever been and is observant of the righteous deeds of creatures, save that soul from whom truly wafteth the odor of turning away, as hath wafted and appeared from that known person - whereat all things lament. His connection was severed when he openly arose among the people to waste the Cause of God. Thou art aware of his words, deeds, actions and wickedness, and likewise of the kindness, mercy and consideration shown to him over numbered years. Nevertheless, he committed that which beseemed and befitted him, and now he seeketh to mislead some of the loved ones of God and obtain glory for himself.\n\nThou and the friends of Truth must arise in such wise in divine love and steadfastness in His Cause as to cause the exaltation of God's Word amongst His servants, that the outcast may be assured that they have not followed his vain desires and that loss remaineth for him alone. Verily, He is the Recompenser, the Wise. Observe and give thanks that the Truth hath ever been like unto the sun, manifest and evident, while falsehood hath been clearly revealed as false before it, as all the loved ones of God know that that soul hath never believed in anything nor adhered to any religion nor followed any path. Night and day he spoke to invalidate what the Truth brought forth, and at all times he clung to the vain imaginings of men. Nevertheless, he now claimeth faith while Satan ever accompanieth him. Thus doth God make clear what He willeth \\[...\\]\n\nThat which is concealed in the breasts of the fettered ones shall be made manifest. Nevertheless, each day someone is wandering through the marketplaces, having been influenced, spreading words. God willing, you should arise with the utmost joy, gladness, delight and expansiveness to protect God's Cause and His loved ones. You have ever been and continue to be remembered before His presence. You yourself witness that the breezes of loving-kindness have ever wafted upon you from the paradise of the Most Great Mercy, and shall continue to do so. Be not disheartened by the concealment of these days, for it hath come to pass through wisdom and expediency. Strive with the utmost effort to unite hearts and harmonize souls. Soon shall you behold the banners of God's favors and bounties raised upon the hills and valleys.\n\nO Nabil! By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hands! I have desired for My loved ones whatsoever good I have desired for Myself, and I have turned to them only as a lover turneth to his beloved, and I have spoken with them only as a true friend speaketh with his friend. We beseech God to make them stars in the heaven of His steadfastness and stability, and suns in the horizon of His victory and triumph. Verily, He is the Protector of those who love Him, and He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nYou mentioned the aged musician. Excellent is what you have mentioned, for in this darkness of sorrows, this remembrance brought joy. God willing, you shall tune the spiritual instrument with spiritual fingers in the name of the Luminary of the heaven of inner meanings. We beseech God to aid you and to manifest through you that which shall gladden the hearts of the sincere ones. Convey on behalf of this servant an exalted greeting to all the loved ones, and declare that if at any time something occurred that caused distress to any of the friends, be not saddened by it. Follow the example of the Truth and act as He has acted.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou seest me and Thy loved ones in the hands of Thine enemies, and Thou knowest what hath befallen us in Thy path, and how tribulations have encompassed us for love of Thee and for the promotion of Thy Cause and the exaltation of Thy Word. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Educator of the nations, to make us of them who have stood firm in Thy Cause, who have been illumined by the horizon of Thy Will, who have drunk the Salsabil of power from the hands of Thy bounty, and who have appeared through Thy Name and Thy sovereignty in such wise that neither the howling of the enemies hath prevented them from Thy mention and praise, nor the opposition of the wicked from turning to the city of Thy Command and the treasury of Thy names. O Lord! Aid us to remain faithful in Thy days and to manifest that which befitteth Thy greatness and majesty. Thou art He in Whose grasp is the reins of all power. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nAs for what thou hast mentioned regarding the women, they remember thee and glorify thee and beseech God to protect thee from the evil of every evil-doer and deceiver, and to make thee a helper of His religion and one who mentioneth His name among His servants.

And whenever I find the love of remembrance in my heart, no cry ascends from my inmost being due to the multitude of calamities with which Thou hast surrounded me, to such extent that I find my lips, through the subtleties of power, make mention of Thee, yet my ears hear not what describes Thee. I know that my heart, with the perfection of its love, praises Thee, yet my tongue knows not how to remember Thee. And this is naught but a bounty from Thee and a favor from Thy presence. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou seest how all the servants are asleep upon their beds while the eyes of Glory await the wonders of Thy mercy. All mankind lie slumbering upon their couches while the Countenance of Beauty lies upon the dust, yearning for the manifestations of Thy compassion. It is as though I behold all directions like unto a sinner who is led to be crucified, looking to his right and his left that perchance he may receive a sign of Thy loving-kindness and the dawning of Thy mercy. Yet have I not witnessed it until now, nor after now. The command is in Thy hands alone. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nI know not, O Sovereign of my Glory, which of my afflictions to complain of before Thee, and which of my tribulations to mention in Thy presence, after the sighs of tears have prevented me from the sovereignty of remembrance when visiting Thy tribulation, and drops of tears have veiled me from the King of description at the manifestation of Thy trials. How great is Thy tribulation and how mighty Thy retribution! Whenever Thou didst preserve me, O my God, from one tribulation, Thou didst deliver me unto another, and whenever Thou didst save me from one abasement, Thou didst rear me for an abasement greater than the first, to such extent that no garment of humiliation remained except that Thou didst clothe me therewith, and no sea of hardship existed except that Thou didst make me drink therefrom, and no fruit of adversity was seen except that Thou didst make me taste thereof.\n\nAlas, alas! Would that I had never existed in the kingdom and had never been mentioned on earth! Alas, alas, for what Thou hast decreed through the wonders of Thy power, and ordained through the manifestations of Thy might, and brought into being through the sovereignty of Thy Lordship, and numbered through the authority of Thy Self-Subsistence, and inscribed upon the tablets of creation by the hands of Thy leave, and ordained upon the face of invention at the exaltation of Thy remembrance!\n\nI know not, O my Beloved, how I can endure before the surging of the winds of Thy power and be still at the manifestation of the signs of Thy might, after the pillars of the sanctuaries of the Kingdom have been demolished at the sprinkling of the tokens of Thy might, and the foundations of the towers of the Realm of Power have been destroyed at the brandishing of the signs of Thy sovereignty. Alas, alas, for the intensity of my weakness at the descent of Thy tribulation! Alas, alas, for my lack of patience at the appearance of Thy vengeance!\n\nBy Thy glory, tribulations in their entirety have seized me, and calamities in their fullness have encompassed me.

I shall not turn to anyone but Thee, even should I face worse afflictions, nor shall I seek any but Thee, even should I be brought lower than this. For I have known none other than Thee to cleave unto, and have witnessed none besides Thee to turn to. If Thou drivest me from one door, I shall enter through another; if Thou keepest me distant from one direction, I shall draw near to Thee from another; if Thou slayest me with one sword, I shall await another. For Thou knowest, O my God, that though Thou mayest have servants better than I, yet I have no sovereign greater than Thee; and though Thou mayest have servants mightier than I, yet I have no master like unto Thee, nor any lord resembling Thee.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God!

Thus have they done unto My Self, if ye be of them that know.\n\nSay: O people!

This indeed is My garment from which every Prophet hath inhaled the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. And through what hath been sent down from His presence have descended the Scriptures of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved. And verily, were He to desire to efface what is established among the servants, He is able through a word from His presence, if ye but understand. And were We to will it, We would reveal in every letter what hath been revealed from time immemorial, yet the people are dead in the veils of their selves.\n\nSay: O people! By God the Truth, ye have committed what neither the Jews, nor the Christians, nor those who suspended the beauty of 'Ali in the air and unjustly slew him, have committed, if ye would but ponder within yourselves. Say: Verily, the people of the Furqan shed the blood of My Name Who appeared with the truth, and ye shed the blood of His Beloved at every moment, yet ye understand not. Say: Then if ye would turn with the ear of innate nature toward the Supreme Horizon, by God ye would surely hear their lamentation, then their cry, then their wailing at what hath befallen Him through Whose one letter was created what was and what shall be, and through another letter hath come the Ancient Beauty in the shadows of the clouds with manifest and visible sovereignty, and through a word from His presence hath He adorned the temple of Lordship with the robe of glorious and beloved majesty. And were there to be found on earth one possessed of insight, by God he would witness that through His will appeared the kingdom of all names, then the dominion of all attributes in their completeness, then through another will He removeth the ornament of Name from the manifestations of names.

This neck of Mine hath lengthened in its love for God and awaiteth your swords - strike then as ye desire. This head of Mine yearneth for the spears of your hatred - raise it upon them and parade it through the lands as ye wish.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! If it be God's crime in your eyes that He hath sent unto you Him Whose meeting ye were promised and Who was pledged in all the Tablets, then pardon Him and make not yourselves deserving of God's vengeance, the King, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And if My crime be that His verses were revealed unto Me and We recited them unto you morning and evening, then forgive Me and thereby make not yourselves deprived of the meeting with God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Beloved. And if your objection be to God for having sent Me so soon, then it behooveth you to thank God for this and say: \"Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled His promise and accomplished what He promised us. Our Lord is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Kind.\" Fear God, O people, distinguish between gratitude and complaint, and deny not the Cause of Him for Whose sake all in the heavens and earth were created. What aileth you, O people, that ye understand not? Have ye ever seen anyone to whom God's favor was sent who would deny it? Nay, by Him Who holdeth My soul in His hand, ye have seen none but yourselves, would ye be fair. The Promised One hath come unto you from nearby, yet ye denied Him.

This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance - His word, exalted be His glory and mighty be His utterance and great be His station:\n\nIn My Name, the One manifest before all faces\n\nThe Book sent down by the Lord of the Seen and Unseen to draw hearts and souls unto God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting. He proclaims amidst all peoples: By God! The All-Bountiful hath come riding upon the clouds, and the necks of those who denied God, the Lord of existence, are bowed before Him. He is the Euphrates of wisdom among all creatures and the Banner of Power for the party of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. And there was inscribed upon it by the Most Glorious Pen: \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving.\" O Amin, hearken unto the call of God, the True King, the Manifest. He maketh mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison with verses before which all verses bow down, and with an utterance through which the Utterance itself hath spoken: \"The Truth, the Knower of the unseen, hath come!\" Through Him power hath been made manifest between the righteous and the wicked. Blessed is he who hath acknowledged and confessed, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. Neither the occupants of pulpits nor the turban-wearing divines who violated the Covenant and Testament, who denied God's proof after its appearance and His bounty after its revelation, could prevent Him. They perceive not. They follow vain imaginings and know not. They drink fetid water and understand not. Say: Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and reject not the Truth through what ye possess. He hath come for your salvation, if ye but knew. Cast away what the people have. The Self-Subsisting calleth out on this Day whereon the sealed wine hath been unsealed by the finger of power at My glorious station. O Amin, glorify My loved ones on My behalf, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the lights of My loving utterance. Every name hath been mentioned by the tongue of the Wronged One as a bounty from God, the Lord of the Promised Day.\n\nHearken in Persian: The souls mentioned have attained the bounties of the True One, exalted be His glory, and now there is no opportunity to make specific mention of each one. O Amin, praise the Goal of the world that thou hast become a means of grace, making mention of the loved ones and seeking from the cloud of divine mercy for each one that which shall never be erased from the Book nor its fragrance cease from the world. Today the Sun of loving-kindness is dawning and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of grace. The ocean of utterance is ever-surging and the verses all-encompassing. Blessed are they who hold fast to justice and equity and who speak with truthfulness. In every city and region convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the righteous and cause them to attain the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whosoever heareth thy word and loveth thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe bounties of God have been and are limitless, and His generosity has not and will not accept any bounds. Those beloved of the heart have attained to that which the pen is powerless to befittingly describe. Whenever your letter arrives, the ocean of favor surges forth, and unto every soul are bestowed the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Such is the grace of the All-Bountiful One. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid that beloved one in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. Praise be to God, you have been and are achieving this. That which was sent has arrived, meaning that which was written in your letter. This year, praise be to God, those who seek admission come with permission and some without permission, from every tribe. I beseech God to ordain for each one that which the heaven itself needs, let alone the people of earth. Three leaves of arrival were sent as per your request. Your letter mentioning the sons of Khalil and the heirs of Kalim, upon them be the glory of God, was seen. God willing, the answer will flow forth and descend from the ocean of favor and the kingdom of utterance, and will be sent. However, that beloved one had not mentioned the other loved ones of God, upon them be the glory of God, specifically the mention of the beloved of the heart, Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God. In all conditions, this evanescent servant beseeches from the ocean of divine generosity, for the loved ones, that which will cause their protection and exaltation. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThe Servant\n\nOn the first of the month of Rajab, 1305\n\n=== END BH00928 ===\n\n=== START BH00929 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and revealed the clear tokens on a Day that was promised in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets, and Who took from His servants and His creation their covenant. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined by the lights of that Day, every learned one was misled by knowledge, and every mystic was veiled by fancies and idle imaginings. Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself through His Name, the All-Knowing, whereupon the ocean of divine knowledge surged within creation, and through His Name, the All-Wise, whereupon the Sun of proof shone forth and the Nightingale warbled upon the branches. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of all religions and Revealer of the Word! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, and by the Name through which Thou didst open the gates of Thy mercy and spread abroad the tablets of Thy loving-kindness, to draw Thy chosen ones nigh unto the horizon of Thy grace and the shore of the ocean of Thy oneness. O Lord! Thou seest Thy faithful servants among the wicked, and the Daysprings of Thy knowledge among the ignorant. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, whereby the hearts of the nations were struck with terror, save those whom Thou didst strengthen through the wonders of Thy grace and the manifestations of Thy bounty, to send down from the heaven of Thy generosity upon Thy loved ones that which befitteth Thy loftiness, Thy sublimity and Thy favors. O Lord! Ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen servants who, upon hearing Thy most sweet call, turned to Thee with illumined hearts and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken in the kingdom of creation. O Lord! Hearts have melted in their separation from Thee, and souls have burned in their remoteness from Thee. O Lord! Deny them not the sweet-flowing waters of Thy presence, and disappoint them not of the pure wine of Thy reunion. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of names. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nFurthermore, thy letter was received and from every word thereof wafted the fragrance of love. Praise be to God that thou hast drunk from the ocean of divine knowledge and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth. The entire world had awaited the appearance of the Day of God, and throughout the nights and days they beseeched God, exalted be His glory, to grant them the presence of the Source of His Cause, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and the Manifestation of His Self. Yet when the expanse of the world was illumined by the lights of the Sun of Revelation and the Promised One was seated upon His mighty throne, all remained heedless and veiled, nay rather, they turned away and denied, save for a few souls. Consider now how glorious is the station of one who hath attained unto this most great bounty and supreme grace. I swear by the pearls of the divine ocean of wisdom that a single accepted soul is mightier and greater than all the peoples of the world, for all were created to recognize this most holy and sublime Day, and in all the scriptures the appearance of this mighty Cause was promised; yet they are seen to be deprived and debarred therefrom. Blessed is he who hath soared on wings in this atmosphere, and blessed is he whose eyes have beheld the greatest signs of his Lord, and blessed is he whose ears have heard His sweetest call, and blessed is he whose face hath turned toward His most exalted horizon, and blessed is he whose heart hath turned toward the Kingdom of immortality, and blessed is he who hath arisen with supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the people of Baha have attained unto the greatest joy and the workers of iniquity and wickedness have been seized with the greatest terror--they who cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed their own desires. The servant beareth witness that they are among the perished ones.\n\nIn My Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious Name\n\nO Muhammad-Quli! Your letter was presented before the Wronged One and was read in His presence. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy father who hath attained that which the near ones have attained. O Ahmad! Praise the Beloved of the world Who hath enabled thee to recognize His Cause - a Cause from which those who claim knowledge and wisdom are debarred and veiled. In the early days thou didst drink from the choice wine of recognition and didst turn unto the horizon of His Cause. Thy mention hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and thy name hath been recorded in the Crimson Book. The whole world hath not equaled and will never equal this most exalted station. Were We to lift the veil, all the peoples of the world would exclaim: \"Blessed be the All-Bountiful, the Manifestation of this mighty station!\" Beseech ye God that through His grace and bounty He may render the eyes of the people of the earth worthy to behold and comprehend this most exalted station. He is the One with power before Whose might every mighty one hath testified, and to Whose grandeur and strength every possessor of authority hath borne witness. We send Our greetings to the friends in that land who have drunk from the Most Pure Wine and who have fixed their gaze upon the Most Great Scene. We counsel them to perform such deeds as would promote the Cause of God. Blessed are they who have hearkened unto the call of God and acted according to that which they were commanded. Woe betide him who hath denied God's Revelation and His sovereignty. The glory shining forth from the horizon of My will be upon you and upon My friends and loved ones whom the darkness of tyranny hath not kept back from the light of justice, and whom the doubts of every remote scholar have not withheld.\n\nThis lowly one conveyeth greetings to thy honorable father - may the glory of God rest upon him. Praise be to God, through divine grace he hath attained, gazeth upon His horizon, and standeth firm in His service. Blessed is he and happy his lot. God willing, may he ever drink from this cup and partake of this chalice.\n\nRegarding the mention in thy letter of Aqa Mir 'Ali-Akbar - upon him be the glory of God - this evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may enable him to celebrate His praise and serve His Cause.\n\nLikewise mention was made of Aqa Yusuf - upon him be the glory of God. This servant conveyeth greetings to him and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, for mercy, bounty and steadfastness for him and all other friends. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Giving, the Generous One. God willing, may none be deprived of the sweet fragrances of His days. May they at all times drink and give to drink the water of divine knowledge from the hand of His bounty. Glory be upon thee and upon thy father and thy brethren and those with thee, and upon those who have attained to the recognition of the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to God, the Exalted King, the Great One.\n\nThe Servant\n\n22nd of the month of Sha'ban 1299\n\n=== END BH00929 ===\n\n=== START BH00931 ===\n\nO My beloved! Divine grace in its totality hath been made manifest, and the all-embracing Word hath been made to shine with utmost brilliance. Ancient bounty hath appeared in its most glorious manifestation, and universal munificence hath been revealed in its highest emergence. The greatest sign hath shone forth with most wondrous tokens, and the supreme proof hath become evident through its most mighty testimony. No grace remaineth hidden in the Essence of the Unseen save that which hath been revealed through this exalted Manifestation. The august Countenance of God had remained concealed for countless ages, cycles, centuries and infinite periods within the pavilion of the beauty and glory of the Unseen, such that all eyes and visions and the pure, hidden, subtle realities of the immortal realms of the Divine Unity were veiled, forbidden and concealed from It. When the resplendent Sun rose from the dawning-place of the fire of Its Own beauty, It consumed with a single revelation all veils and pavilions of the highest horizons through the fire of Its Own sacred Tree, and stunned all the abstract realities of the unseen with a single effulgence from the light of Its holy countenance. Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him! What fire is this, that the very essence of the true spirit is prevented from soaring around it, and the pure reality of the Eternal is cut off from ascending into its atmosphere! The Most Great Tree is rent asunder by the call of Its nearness, and the Ancient Essence is thunderstruck by the revelation of Its glory. Resurrections are raised up through Its august arising, and gatherings are prepared through the spreading of Its wondrous Cause. At every moment there issueth from the Most Perspicuous Pen the cry \"Verily I am God, the Lord of all worlds,\" and the revelation of \"Exalted, exalted be God, the Most Manifest of the Manifest\" shineth resplendent. Were I to describe this Manifestation's praise,\n\nA hundred thousand trumpet blasts could not convey;\n\nFor in each instant from It a hundred resurrections spring,\n\nAnd in each, the spreading of a Greater Rising doth display.\n\nWere I to attempt describing just one Rising fair,\n\nA hundred resurrections would pass, yet still unfinished there.\n\nBut how strange, how passing strange! By the utterance of His Holiness the Most Exalted Lord - may the spirit of all creation be His sacrifice - strange upon strange, strange from above strange, strange from the right of strange, strange from the left of strange, and strange beyond all strangeness! Had not His Holiness the Most Exalted Lord pronounced it thus far, I would forever and ever exclaim: How strange, how strange that with this wondrous and transcendent Revelation, not a single soul has yet emerged from the veil of fancy and imitation; and despite all these divine confirmations manifest in the visible world, not one person has attained true certitude.\n\nI swear by the Essence of the Divine Purpose that the sweet-scented breezes of holiness have been cut off from all beings, and the gentle winds of intimacy have been forbidden from all hearts. Exalted spirits have turned to base stations, remaining distant from the most sublime horizon and the Most Glorious Tree. Though twenty years have passed since all were brought forth with a new nature, they have not even imagined the Most Great Ocean of oceans, and have turned away from the Essence of all essences through conjecture and fancy.\n\nThey have imagined that all the ascending steps and degrees of this glorious Cycle - around which hundreds of thousands of infinite divine cycles have revolved in the worlds of the unseen and the visible until culminating in this Cycle - are merely the learnings to which these companions have attained. I swear by the Essence of the Purpose and the Educator of the unseen and visible realms that none among those who have attained the heavens of true knowledge and certitude, who stand in the heights of unity and the summit of detachment and abstraction, have understood even this much: what was the fruit of this Cycle and what was the purpose of this Revelation.\n\nSetting aside ascent to the Ultimate Tree and rising to its exalted stations, even those of noble heart have descended to dusty imaginings. How strange, how strange that the people of the Exalted City, who for years have dwelled beneath the shadow of the Supreme Education and have been nurtured by the hand of divine favor, have not yet shown even the measure of one steadfastness in the Cause. Each has clung to a cord and become content with a fancy, remaining utterly deprived of this infinite grace which surges like a billowing sea.\n\nI swear by the truth of the Beloved that the pure holy fragrances have been entirely cut off from that direction. Not a single holy breath can be detected from any of the inhabitants of the earth. I know not in what realm they walk or what path they follow. This much is certain: that despite all the divine counsels bestowed upon each one at every moment, not a single steadfast soul in love can be found - especially in these days which are the time of the supreme trial and the great separation.\n\nConsider with utmost care the sublime Tablet known as the Divine Mariner and its Persian translation, which was revealed in the wilderness of Vashshash seven months before the blessed migration, and was sent because of the hidden events recorded therein. Then the extent of everyone's faithfulness and these loved ones' claims will become clear - at what rank and station they truly stand. Though from what is evident and what can be sensed in the air, even if a hundred thousand such revealed tablets were to be read to these souls, they would never be stirred and \\[...\\]\n\nIn these wondrous Tablets, newly revealed and sent forth from the Most Holy and Most Glorious Court, observe how during this period all the people of the Bayan, without exception--even unto the most exalted among them--have been heedless of the essence of the Cause. Would that after all this heedlessness shown during this time, they might now become mindful and make amends for the past. Nay! I swear by the Holy and Eternal Being that day by day the veils of existence increase, and the attachment of hearts to this earthly world grows stronger. Glory be to God! This is a strange mystery that not a single soul should in these days attain to the good-pleasure of God, even were that soul to be created from the very essence of all essences. Now that the greatest tumult and the mightiest separation have come to pass, let us see what will appear hereafter. And verily He is the Manifestor of all things and of whatsoever was then hidden. I make mention of the dwellers of the Sacred Sanctuary and remind them of the Most Glorious Beauty. Each and every inhabitant of the City do I specially mention and remind with the jewels of glorification and the essence of veneration, that they may all, God willing, remain firm and steadfast in the stations of divine love and be gladdened by the glad-tidings of the Spirit from the holy Paradise of grace.\n\n=== END BH00931 ===\n\n=== START BH00932 ===\n\nOn the 15th of Ramadan in the year 98, to his honor Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God\n\nHe is God - exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power\n\nPraise, sanctified from the mention and description of all contingent beings, beseemeth that peerless Beloved Who, through His perfect grace, hath guided them that are endowed with vision to the Most Exalted Horizon and enabled them that are possessed of hearing to hearken unto His sweetest call. Glory be unto God! Should all the tongues of the world and the pens of all nations engage in mentioning but the least of His verses, they would assuredly fail in their task. All good hath proceeded from Him and unto Him doth it return; all loving-kindness and grace have been manifested through Him and unto their Source do they tend. He it is Who guided them that possess sight - but who bestowed that sight? And He it is Who enabled them that have ears to hear - but whence came those ears and who granted them? Glorified be His majesty, abundant be His favors, exalted be His station, and there is no God but Him. He is the Bestower in the Beginning and the End, in the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is the Beneficent in the First and the Last, in the Seen and the Unseen. He granted sight and enabled its possessors to behold; He bestowed hearing and honored its recipients with the ability to hearken. Whatsoever proceedeth from Him is pure light, though it might appear as fire when kindled, and is absolute good, though outwardly it might be perceived otherwise. I testify that there is no God but Him. His are the glory and the power, His are the grace and the mercy and the authority. Whatsoever hath been and shall be manifested from Him is the beloved of the souls of His chosen ones and the light of the hearts of His sincere ones. He hath created souls that are assured, content and pleasing, and then He hath spoken the word \"Verily, I am the Doer of whatsoever I will.\"\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of all beings and Goal of all creation! I beseech Thee by Him Who revealed the verses and manifested the clear proofs, to assist Thy servants in that which beseemeth Thy days and to make known unto them the mysteries of Thy decree and the fruits of the Tree of Thy ordination. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones turning unto Thee and holding fast unto the cord of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty which hath encompassed all existence and by Thy mercy which hath preceded both the unseen and the seen, to send down from the heaven of Thy grace that which will acquaint them with the manifestations of Thy wisdom and the revelations of Thy knowledge. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear from Thy loved ones that which indicated their contentment with what was ordained for them by Thy binding decree. And thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Best-Beloved, for having enabled me to inhale the sweet fragrances of their submission to that which hath come upon them from the Pen of Thy ordination. I testify, O my God and the God of all who are in the heavens and the earth, my Lord and the Lord of all who are in the kingdom of command and creation, that Thou hast ever been the One God, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Giving, the All-Merciful. Thou didst bring forth creation as a token of Thy grace and ordained for them in the Most Exalted Pen, in Thy Book, that which would benefit them in every world of Thy worlds. Blessed is he who hath quaffed the choice wine of contentment in Thy days, O Lord of all names, and hath attained unto the pure water of submission unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of creation. I beseech Thee by the leaves of the Tree of Thy Cause, and the trees of the garden of Thy bounty, and the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom, and the lights of the countenances of Thy near ones among Thy chosen ones, to assist me and Thy servants in the service of Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Your letter has reached this servant and your missive brought me joy, adorned as it was with the mention of our Beloved and your Beloved, acknowledging what the Book of our Goal and your Goal has acknowledged. When I read and understood its contents, I approached the Most Holy Presence and presented it before Him. Thereupon the tongue of the Beloved spoke, saying:\n\nO servant in attendance! Although a great calamity befell Muhammad - upon him be my Baha - yet since it occurred during the illumined and blessed days of the Promised One, at a time when he was adorned with the ornament of contentment and illumined by the sun of steadfastness and assurance, his is the station of contentment and submission. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, for We found from thee the fragrance of contentment when there befell thee what was ordained by the Pen of Destiny from thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Marfu' 'Ali - upon him be my Baha - by the testimony of the Supreme Pen, turned unto God, heard the Call, attained its answer, was honored by the meeting, and drank from the Kawthar of reunion - a draught whose effects neither before his ascension nor after it were or ever shall be effaced. I swear by the Sun of Utterance that he ascended with utmost joy and delight and entered the pavilions of grace, bounty and pre-existing mercy. Happy is he and blessed is he. And you, praise be to God, are turned toward the Truth, speak of Him, remember Him, and are related to Him. This word cannot be equaled by the treasures of the first and the last. Be thou grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds! The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are there. Verily We remember them as We remembered them before. He is, in truth, the All-Remembering, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWhatever this servant might express or mention regarding that which has appeared from the Kingdom of bounty would truly be out of place. However, this much I submit: in hardship and adversity, in comfort and difficulty, in health and otherwise, we have been and are partners. God willing, we are united and gathered like the letters of a word. I swear by the Beloved of all possibility that this evanescent servant at all times begs that there might befall him what befell His Holiness Marfu' - upon him be the Glory of God - for it occurred in the days of Truth and he had truly attained the ornament of contentment. There has not been and is not any greater bounty than this. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause all to attain this most exalted and highest station. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nFrom your letters which you had sent to the friends of God, the fragrances of contentment were wholly diffused and the lights of submission, like the sun, were rising from their horizon. I presented those same letters before His Countenance. God knows what the tongue of the Beloved uttered. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He is, verily, the All-Witnessing, the All-Seeing. His is the command in all conditions. There is no God but He, the Ruler over what He willeth. In His grasp is the reins of all servants, and He is the Protector of all who are in the heavens and the earth. The Glory be upon thee and upon those whom God has adorned with the robe of submission and contentment, and given to drink from the Kawthar of purity from the hands of His bounty. He is, verily, the Munificent, the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00932 ===\n\n=== START BH00933 ===\n\nAll praise, sanctified from the world and all its peoples, befitteth the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Court of Him Who is the Object of all, Who through a single command brought into being creation from beginning to end, and adorned the beginning with the ornament of the end. Through Him were the idols of vain imaginings shattered--exalted be His might and His sovereignty! Though all the world rose up in opposition, He, through the Criterion, separated truth from falsehood, establishing truth in the most exalted station and consigning falsehood to the nethermost fire. Again, exalted be His might, His power and His sovereignty! Though in the beginning of the Cause He had no helper or supporter, that Holy Being arose alone to establish His Cause. At times He caused the water of life to be shed upon the soil of existence, whence sprouted the saplings of acceptance and certitude, which grew to maturity. At other times He bestowed from the ocean of knowledge upon the decomposed bones of the earth, whereupon all were stirred to motion and gave voice to the blessed words \"Blessed be God, the Best of Creators!\" Again \\[...\\] and the abasement of His enemies. Every soul who at first arose in mockery later arose in servitude, seeking forgiveness with a hundred thousand repentances, while others were consumed by the fire of ignorant prejudice and returned to their abode, which is the very essence of hell.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Sender of the winds, Manifester of the dawn, and Ordainer of success! I beseech Thee by the Lamp which Thou didst kindle with the fire of Thy knowledge and didst make the Seal of Thy Prophets and Chosen Ones, that Thou aid Thy servants to be steadfast in Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest how the heedless have surrounded those who have turned to Thy most exalted horizon and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! O Lord! Ordain for Thy loved ones that which shall protect them from the evil of those who have turned away from Thee and disputed Thy proof and Thy testimony. Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. Thou givest and withholdest, and verily Thou art the All-Giving, the All-Restraining, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nI pray and offer salutations upon Him through Whom the banner of Divine Unity was raised and the decree of promise and warning was sent down, and upon His companions who held fast to God's Covenant and His Testament in such wise that neither the pharaohs of the people nor the tyrants of the age could turn them aside. These are servants in whose praise have spoken the tongues of the Prophets and Messengers.\n\nAfterwards, it is submitted that one blessed night your letters were presented before His Presence. He said: \"We beseech God, the Most High, to grant them goodness and blessing as We have beseeched before. God willing, may they be assisted in all conditions with that which leads to exaltation, elevation and advancement. This Wronged One asks God for their success. He is verily the Helper, the Wise.\" End quote.\n\nGod is witness and testifier that this ephemeral one's longing to serve those beloved ones cannot be described in writing nor be confined to verbal mention. Day and night, at special times, you have been and are remembered and in view. Truly, whenever your letters arrive, it is as if caravans of joy and delight enter the barren desert of grief and sorrow. Another beauty added to this beauty is that no matter how delayed the reply may be, you do not hold this servant responsible, as you know he is occupied in service.\n\nAnother submission is that, praise be to God, numerous gardens have been adorned with wondrous and lofty trees, brilliant and radiant flowers, and fresh, delicate herbs. However, the difference is that these gardens are still mentioned in the realm of remembrance and planted in papers, but it is hoped they will choose a location in the small plot and become a gathering place for eyes to receive bounty.\n\nIn any case, truly much trouble has befallen those beloved ones regarding the small plot - that is to say, mercy, or rather bounty (these last two words were uttered by the Tongue of the Intended One). The flowers, trees, blossoms, and the cleaner of the trees' dust that you sent are all engaged in thanksgiving. The blessed deed itself is present and speaking; there was and is no need for mention by this servant. However, these days the small plot has displayed much splendor, the flowers have bloomed, the colorful fish are swimming in the pond, and even the weary birds of this land seem to have somewhat found their voice, as these days there appears some melody in their song. It is not known whether this is from the splendor of the garden or from the attraction of those intoxicated with the true wine. Though outwardly your place is empty, God is witness that you are present before the face.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the envelopes, by God's grace all arrived, and concerning what you wrote about the trees and flowers, praise be to God, they went to smell the air and are very pleased and delighted with the garden's atmosphere. The jars and pitchers, praise be to God, did not ascend to heaven and remain in their place. And that sweetness and those utterances which you wrote about from the Source of Grace concerning carrying the hyacinth to the farm - now too that same grace is manifest and visible, nay greater. May the Lord of nations grant that you may ever dwell in the pavilions of grace and rest in the garden of nearness.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the accounts and partnership, it was submitted at one of the special times. He said: \"It has been written with truth and rightness. God willing, may they ever drink from the cup of grace and gaze toward the horizon of justice.\" What is truly intended and desired has been and is the word of contentment. Praise be to God, they have attained unto it. If the entire world were to become tongues, they could not fulfill the thanks for a single one of God's bounties. The spirit, peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you and remember you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAgain I make representation. In one of the letters this passage, which was a source of joy, was noted: \"The end is nigh and nothing could be achieved, and there is fear that our lot will come up blank and we will not be counted among the hosts.\" After this submission, this reply was vouchsafed: \"Your lot was inscribed by the Supreme Pen at the beginning of creation, and you are counted and designated among the hosts of 'verily the hosts of God, they shall be the victorious ones.' Happy are ye and joy be unto you!\"\n\n=== END BH00933 ===\n\n=== START BH00934 ===\n\nHe is God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!\n\nGlorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth from the heaven of sublime might, and Who speaketh the truth in His most exalted Kingdom with His most wondrous and sweet tongue, that perchance the people may find a path to the realm of the spirit before the throne of their Lord, the All-Merciful. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not your own selves if ye desire the bounty of God, for His bounty encompasseth you. And when the Sun of Words dawneth upon you from the horizon of the King of Names and Attributes, be ye not proud, but rather prostrate yourselves before the Beauty of your Lord, Who was remembered in the heaven of eternity by the name of Glory and in the kingdom of creation as the Most Exalted One.\n\nO people! Deny not the verses of God after their revelation, and choose not Satan as your protector. Beware lest ye be perturbed in the hour when all things are shaken, when the heaven is cleft asunder, when the earth below is split, when the mountains crumble, when the seas surge, when every pregnant thing casteth its burden, and when the inhabitants of the heavens and earth are overcome with drunkenness. Thus hath the Command been sent down in truth from the Pen of Holiness, and God is witness to what I say.\n\nCast away all that veils you from God, then ascend on wings of holiness unto this heaven which hath been raised up in truth and was elevated in the Most Great Name through mystery. Say: By God! The breezes of grace have wafted from the dayspring of justice, and by them all things have been borne along, if ye be aware thereof. Soon will all creation cast its burden; then shall ye see the idolaters fleeing to the right and to the left, finding no safe refuge. Thus have We informed thee of the news of the Cause, that thou mayest become acquainted with the mysteries that were concealed behind the pavilions of glory.\n\nSay: O people! Take the crimson cup from the fingers of Baha, then detach yourselves from all who are in earth and heaven. And if ye are able, mount, in My Most Exalted Name, upon the crimson Ark and sail upon the sea of grandeur, that ye may reach the seat which is protected from the arrows of the idolaters. O people! Hear ye the call of God from every direction, and turn not unto those who have denied Him in Whom they had believed, and who were far removed from the paths of truth. Among the idolaters is he who strove with his wealth and his soul to exalt My Cause, yet when My beauty was manifested unto him, he denied it and turned back upon his heels.\n\nAnd thou, O servant, although no letter from thee hath come before the Throne, yet when thy name was mentioned We revealed unto thee that which shall solace thine eyes and the eyes of them that have believed in God and were steadfast in the path of might. Be thou steadfast in thyself, lest aught cause thee to slip from the path, then thank thy Lord for having sent down unto thee a wondrous and glorious Tablet. Thus have We bestowed upon thee from the wonders of Our grace and sent unto thee that whereby thou mayest find the fragrances of thy Lord and take up thine abode in the shadow of thy Lord's protection, an abode secure in truth.\n\nAmong the people is he who openly turneth away from God, and when God's verses are recited unto him his face darkeneth and he returneth unto his family in disgrace. And among them is he who saith these verses were not revealed according to natural disposition. Say: By God! Natural disposition itself was created by a letter thereof, as witnesseth that which floweth from the wondrous Pen of Holiness. And among them is he who hath fabricated lies against God and said this is naught but a sorcerer who bewitcheth the people, and by what proceeded from his mouth his deeds were rendered vain.\n\nSay: O people! Fear God and speak not what the idolaters spoke when the Sun of Eternity dawned forth from the Dayspring of Hijaz with manifest sovereignty. Thus did the idolaters speak in the time of every Prophet until the days culminated in the Days of God and the Beauty of Eternity shone forth from the horizon of the Most Exalted Name. O servant! Sanctify the ears of holiness from the utterances of the idolaters, then plunge into the depths of this ocean by thy Lord's leave, the All-Merciful, that thou mayest find precious pearls of wisdom. Say: We took a handful of dust and kneaded it with the waters of Our command, then breathed into it a spirit from Our order, adorned it with Our most beauteous names in the kingdom of creation, and raised it to a station wherein its name became renowned among all, great and small. When it attained its maturity and became established in itself, it waxed proud against the Self of God and His sovereignty, until it openly warred against Him. Thus was the decree of destiny inscribed by the Finger of God concerning the Beauty of thy Lord, the Most High. Say: O people! Fear God and be not heedless in the Cause of God. By God! This is among the tidings whereby the eyes of the denizens of the immortal realm were solaced, preserved behind the veils of light through God's protection. When the appointed time was fulfilled, it shone forth from the holy horizon with a proof that encompassed all worlds. If ye deny this proof, by what proof can your faith be established? Nay, by Him Who caused the heavens to shine with the light of His countenance, ye shall find no path to the truth. Say: O people! When the Messenger of God cometh unto you with His signs, arise from your seats and grasp Him with the fingers of submission. If ye perceive from Him the fragrance of God, your Beloved, deny Him not. Thus hath the command been sent down from the celestial dominion of holiness by One mighty and powerful. O people! Follow the religion and faith of God, and commit not what ye have been forbidden in the Book. Fear God and remain steadfast in His Cause. Soon shall the idolaters call someone from there and instill in his heart hatred for God and the Manifestation of His Self, and send him to the lands and unto you bearing that which will turn the people away from the path of glorious might. Blessed is he who is not shaken by the commotion of polytheism and remaineth steadfast in the Cause of his Lord. By God! He is better in the sight of thy Lord than all who have been created in the heavens and earth. These are among the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee as a bounty from Us unto thee and unto every discerning believer. And the glory rest upon thee and upon those who have taken shelter beneath this Lote-Tree which hath been raised up in truth and was planted by God's hand of bounty at the heart of paradise.\n\n=== END BH00934 ===\n\n=== START BH00935 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nPraise be to God! The heaven of love has arrived, meaning the letter, and the stars of faith, certitude, steadfastness and fidelity are manifest, resplendent, radiant and shining from its horizons. If it were called an ocean of love, that too would be true, for the shells of its words contained the pearls of inner meanings. It gave strength to vision and joy to the heart. Blessed be the pen and fingers, for though they appear as nothingness, yet a hundred thousand interpretations, explanations and meanings are true of them. The station of the gathering of all gatherings has in truth been with the Word of God in the first degree, and likewise the words that are uttered in praise, glorification, love and fidelity from the tongue of His loved ones - it expresses without a tongue and writes without pen and ink. Well does it comprehend the mysteries of the lovers. All perfect work is His, for its fragrance shows the way and makes known the destination. His is the praise, His the perfection, His the beauty, His the power, His the grace. And prayers and peace be upon the Sovereign of the Prophets and the King of the Chosen Ones, through Whose face the world was illumined and through Whose bright utterance the horizon of possibility shone forth - He whom God made His Most Great Word the key to unlock the door of knowledge and wisdom - and upon His family, the stars in the heaven of grace and proof, and upon His companions, the standards of victory in the realm of possibility.\n\nThereafter, your esteemed letter arrived, bringing glad tidings, conveying news, bestowing joy. It was a messenger bearing a thousand messages, a book containing the mysteries of the lovers and the secrets of the people of harmony and the Covenant. In truth, the flame of spirit was manifest from it. Once, this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - He said that when the Sun of Unity shed its rays, in each of the hearts of those who had turned to God and were assured, a light became manifest and radiant. And that light was one, for it told of the Sun of Unity and indicated the Orb of Detachment, and in its station it was and ever will be one. Yet from its orientation to each direction, a name becomes manifest, a word becomes evident, and a cloud becomes visible. For example, through its orientation to the means of sight, vision becomes manifest, and through the means of hearing, the power of listening becomes evident, and likewise with each member of the body and each part of the parts. Exalted be His utterance, exalted His proof, exalted His remembrance, exalted His interpretation! Though your letter was one, it brought manifold wondrous and novel gifts. The rest of the story is yours to tell - it has been read and understood and needs no interpretation, for that would lead to length, and prolongation might cause weariness. After reading, understanding, considering and reflection, proceeding to the station, after presentation He said:\n\nPraise be to God! They are warmed by the Sun of loving-kindness and illumined by the lights of His countenance. The Truth has manifested that which was beyond the comprehension of the mystics and learned ones of the earth, and they too have arisen to serve, beyond the understanding of the people of all lands. We beseech God that He may bring to realization every word that has issued from the mine of sincerity and make manifest from it universal results throughout the earth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to all the friends in that land. The One God is witness that they are mentioned in His presence and are present before His face. The end.\n\nPraise be to God! Although these days are blessed days when fasting is among the binding divine ordinances, and weakness and lassitude are human traits, yet His grace hath bestowed bounties and favors. His Word is not weakened by fasting, nor doth abstinence prevent His work. His is the praise and glory, and His the gratitude and bestowal.\n\nConcerning what was written about Aqa Muhammad Mahdi, upon him be God's peace, permission is hereby granted according to His command that he may proceed to the prison and thence to whatsoever God willeth and desireth. Give him these glad tidings and convey greetings.\n\nAs to what was written concerning the Siyyid and his affairs, what transpired is well known. Those beloved ones have not and will not fall short in such matters. I beseech God to manifest through the Siyyid that which shall cause joy and delight to the friends in those regions.\n\nWhat that certain person said about the companion of His Holiness Ismu'llah was false and contrary to wisdom. Glory be to God! The friends of God must be truthful, discreet, calm, patient and wise. That false statement was in no way appropriate, but rather departed from the requirements of wisdom. I beseech and implore God to make all aware and grant them knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nFrom all the letters sent by each of the friends of this land, and from the detailed words and multiple letters, the fragrance of the beloved of the heart, His Holiness Muhammad, emanates. Praise and thanks be to God Who exalted the two names and adorned them with the ornament of enduring mention. This person is, in one station, the seal of bounties and the confirmer of hearts. When love takes possession of a place and fills it, no room remains for mention or praise to appear. In short, the heart has been conquered by the hosts of love; there remains no other station for manifestation and appearance.\n\nThey sent reed pens. Surely these reeds are superior to those mentioned by Rumi, for those complained of separation while these, God willing, shall tell of nearness, meeting and reunion.\n\nThe fragrant flowers sent by the aforementioned one, upon him be God's peace, arrived. They were both used in his presence at the time of breaking the fast and also given to the friends. A line was sent in reply to his letter which they will deliver, God willing.\n\nI convey greetings to all the friends and masters. All are mentioned and have attained the grace of the Friend. I beseech God, exalted be His station, to grant success to all, bestow blessings, give joy, grant steadfastness, and make all happy through beholding one another. This servant has ever yearned and continues to yearn for meeting the friends of God. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.\n\n=== END BH00935 ===\n\n=== START BH00936 ===\n\nHe is God, the Mighty, the Beneficent!\n\nThis is a Book that speaketh the truth, wherein is that which will guide mankind to the shore of divine unity, nourish them with the fruits of knowledge and wisdom, and lead them into the holy and resplendent paradise. Therein is that which will guide men to the court of glory and grace, and sever them from all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. Say: O people! Hearken unto My words and be not of those who deny the signs of God and turn away. Follow the truth in His days - this is better for you than all who dwell in the kingdom. Say: O people! Answer the call of God's Herald among you and be not heedless of Him, after ye were created for this purpose, as the angels near unto God do testify.\n\nSay: By God! The gates of Paradise have been opened wide, and there hath come the Command of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The Dove hath warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Eternity - thus hath it been ordained by the All-Wise, the All-Informed. The breezes of bounty and grace have wafted, and the gardens of the Cause have been adorned, if ye be of those who perceive. Fear God, and follow not your own desires, neither turn your faces toward the evil ones, for they bid you to transgression and wickedness, while God commandeth righteousness and salvation, if ye be of them that hear.\n\nSay: Have ye not heard what was revealed aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, of holy and glorious verses? He said - and His word is the truth - \"On the day when thy Lord cometh, or certain of the signs of thy Lord.\" And these verses were truly revealed, and the heavens and earth were filled thereby. And have ye not heard \"On the day when the heaven shall be cleft asunder by clouds\" - these are the clouds whereby the heavens of existence were rent asunder, if ye be of those who understand the signs of God. And it was revealed \"On the day when the heaven shall bring a manifest smoke\" - this is the smoke that hath blinded your eyes, whereby ye recognized not your Lord and turned away from the Beauty of divine holiness and glory, though ye were promised this in preserved scrolls. This hath been inscribed on the Preserved Tablet, as witnessed by the denizens of the highest Paradise.\n\nSay: O people! Have mercy upon yourselves, then fear the Day wherein ye shall return to a mighty and holy seat, and shall be questioned concerning what ye have wrought in your vain life, and shall be recompensed for your deeds. Thus hath it been inscribed by the Pen of Command upon a clear and glorious Tablet.\n\nLament with the lamentation of one who has lost all, for this Bird dwelt among you for successive years, yet you failed to attain His presence, though His presence would have profited you more than all your deeds throughout your days. God is sufficient witness to what I say. You remained heedless of Him and occupied yourself with words whereof no Messenger had ever uttered a single letter. Hearken, then, to My counsel: migrate from your self to God, detach yourself from all that keeps you from knowing Him, and be not of the slumberous ones. Let what your hands have wrought suffice you, and fear God Who created and fashioned you, and be of those who seek forgiveness. You were as one sleeping upon the couch of heedlessness, so deep in slumber that you heard not the cry of the strivers, though that cry had encompassed all who dwell in earth and heaven, and had caused these deniers to swoon away. How many heads were raised upon spears in the path of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful! How much blood was shed upon the earth while you remained unmindful thereof and were not among those who remembered! How many bodies were cast upon the dust while you questioned not concerning them, as though you had never been created to be among the just! You remained seated in your house and aided not your Lord, nor were you among the helpers. Is one who turns away from God his Lord like unto one who turns toward Him? Glory be to Him, far above what these idolaters imagine! Have you not heard what was revealed aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God and Seal of the Prophets? \"Woe to every sinful impostor who hears the verses of God recited unto him, then continues proudly, as though he heard them not. Announce unto him a painful punishment.\" You heard the verses of God, then waxed proud against them, and were not conscious thereof for even a moment. By God! The eyes of your inner being weep for you, for you turned away from God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. You answered not God's Herald, cast His verses behind your back, and were among those submerged in the ocean of heedlessness. Hearken, then, to the words of this servant - this is better for you than the sovereignty of the heavens and earth. Arise from your seat through God's power, then detach yourself from all else but Him. Fear no one, but put your trust in Him, for unto Him do the affairs of those who trust return. Your days shall pass away and you shall return to dust, and then shall you be in manifest loss. By God! I desire naught through this epistle save to deliver you from the prison of self and to sanctify you from all that prevents you from entering a seat of sublime glory. Know then that this Dove has offered up Its soul in the path of God. The praise of any praiser adds not to Its worth, nor does the censure of any critic diminish It, for Its whole affair returns to God, the Lord of all worlds. It fears no one, even should all who are in the kingdom combine against It. Say: Verily, It has soared unto God, and unto Him is Its return and resting-place, if you be of those who know. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00936 ===\n\n=== START BH00937 ===\n\nKnow ye that during Our sojourn in the Land of Mystery, sublime Tablets were sent down and dispatched to certain monarchs in order to complete God's testimony. Among these was a Tablet revealed to the King of Paris who at that time was foremost among sovereigns. The cause of this was that one day in the presence of the Divine Throne, He stated that after the Russo-Ottoman dispute, the King of Paris arose to aid the Ottoman Empire, and following strife, conflict, bloodshed and pillage, several monarchs intervened and a peace treaty was concluded. Thereafter, the Russian Monarch inquired of the King of Paris: \"We both belonged to the same nation - what caused you to dishonor those of your own faith and aid those of another?\" In reply he wrote that there was no reason save that when some Ottoman subjects were suddenly attacked by you in the Black Sea and many were drowned, the cry of those oppressed ones awakened me from slumber and I arose to assist them. After relating this incident, He declared: \"Now We shall send him a Tablet and test him. If he arises to aid the oppressed ones among the people of the Bayan, We shall confirm his words; otherwise his falsehood in what he claimed and stated shall become evident.\" Thus a Tablet was revealed and sent to him, but no response was ever received, although one of his ministers who secretly professed love for the Cause informed the Most Holy Court that he had personally delivered the Tablet to the king and verbally conveyed all details. Nevertheless, no reply came. This is why, after receiving no response to that Tablet, this second Tablet was revealed and sent, having been written in French. Now consider this Tablet - all that befell him was explicitly foretold therein without any ambiguity. Blessed are they who read! Blessed are they who ponder! Blessed are they who are sincere! Likewise, reflect upon its wondrous creation and dispatch with power and majesty. Observe how, after the completion of God's testimony and the manifestation of His might, afflictions of famine, scarcity and fear encompassed Persia. News of these matters was revealed in numerous Tablets. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! If souls were to reflect upon its wondrous creation, its dispatch, its contents, and all that subsequently transpired, it would suffice them all, and God's proof, more manifest than the sun, would become evident and clear to all. But artificial entities remain occupied with their own realm, having neither gained nor will they gain any portion of the divine breaths and the fragrance of the verses of the All-Merciful, save whom God willeth. As is observed, despite this most great proclamation, this supreme manifestation, and these evident signs, certain servants have chosen to follow souls who have always been and will remain behind veils, and from whom no matter has ever become manifest. What benefit is there when this servant lacks time, else he would have presented all that has appeared and continues to appear from God's verses which have been revealed explicitly without interpretation. We beseech God to aid the servants to be fair.\n\nEvery one may be apprised of the verses of God which have been revealed explicitly, without interpretation. We beseech God to assist His servants to be fair and to dispel their vain imaginings and what has been mentioned by those who came before. How strange are those who followed the stinking ones after the fragrance of the Beloved had been diffused throughout the worlds! For instance, they remain veiled from the Most Holy, Most Exalted Truth by following Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani and his utterances, though he was never aware of the fundamental nature of the Cause and was perpetually engaged in mischief.\n\nThough it is a common saying, yet it befits this station: \"Behold the blind leading another blind one!\"\n\nBy God! By God! Any person possessed of sight and smell who beheld him but once perceived from his countenance the effects of hell-fire and from his breath the stench of the people of the deepest abyss. Each day he was occupied with some new deception. When we arrived at the Most Great Prison, he styled himself \"Quddus Effendi,\" imagining that a meaningless name would exalt its bearer. Woe unto him and unto those who followed him!\n\nSimilarly, he named Aqa Jan \"The Chief of the Polytheists, the Sword of Truth\" and promised him Iraq, as evidenced by Aqa Jan's own letter which still exists, written to the Chief of the Polytheists, pleading: \"When will that promise you made be fulfilled?\" In short, in this land he declared to everyone: \"I am the Sword of Truth and shall soon conquer most lands.\" Nay! The curse of God be upon the liars!\n\nAt this point, verses were revealed from the heaven of divine Will. His glory be exalted! He says:\n\n\"The Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious! Verily in the tribulation of the Lord of all possibilities in \\[earth and\\] heaven, He has indeed come with the truth in His Name, the One Who rules over creation. Illumine thy heart with the Most Great Lamp which the Lord of Eternity hath kindled, then stand firm in the Cause through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\" \\[...\\]\n\n=== END BH00937 ===\n\n=== START BH00938 ===\n\nO beloved of my heart! For some time this has flowed from the Pen of Divine Decree, yet its dispatch was delayed - this too was ordained by another decree, for the servant is as one dead between the hands of God's power, glory be to His majesty. He turneth him as He willeth, for He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He desireth, the Single, the One, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By virtue of God's all-encompassing wisdom, this letter was not sent. Your other letter, O beloved of my heart, which you dispatched from Nablus, arrived. The arrival of this spiritual messenger bearing tidings of your health and well-being, O spiritual beloved, praise be to God, manifested both outwardly and inwardly signs of love, affection, submission and contentment. After its reading and review, it was presented before the countenance of our Lord and was honored to be heard. He said: \"His honor Muhammad-Qabli-Rida, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all beings, is confirmed and assisted in performing good deeds and in the mention and praise of God, glory be to His majesty. We beseech Him, blessed and exalted is He, to give him to drink at all times from the Kawthar of His knowledge from the hand of His bounty, and to confirm him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and that which manifests the stations of man among the peoples. Verily, He is the Ruler in the beginning and in the end. We beseech Him to send down upon him from the heaven of His generosity blessing and care and mercy from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, there is no God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\" Indeed, your mentions are joy-giving, for the fragrance of sincerity and trust emanates therefrom. A guest like yourself and a host like His Eminence Effendi, may God, blessed and exalted is He, preserve him, who are in truth illumined and adorned with the light of faith, assurance and knowledge - blessed be his presence. Indeed, he is worthy of these stations, for he is of the family of the Ansar and is himself counted among the Ansar, having been and continuing to be a helper of the oppressed and the distressed. We beseech God, glory be to His majesty, to keep him adorned with this ornament in all conditions. Verily He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is. And regarding your request, O beloved of my heart, to be confirmed in sending that which yields fruit for the seekers of the paradise of knowledge and manifests a resplendent bounty - indeed this matter is confirmed and established by your intention. \"The intention of the believer is better than his deed,\" it hath been said. Regret over the loss of what is befitting of good and charitable deeds - such regret in one station taketh precedence over the deed itself. We beseech God, the Source of all causes, to make our deeds and intentions adorned with the ornament of His acceptance. Verily He is the Generous, possessed of great bounty, and He is the Single, the Giver, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Again mention is made that the apple of our eyes, Aqa Inayatu'llah, together with the honored mother and sister, upon them be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], are all well and are gladdened by your mention. 152\n\nPraise be to the Goal of all the worlds that the glad tidings of the well-being of that beloved of spirit and heart arrive and adorn the mind with the radiance of joy and delight. In truth, the mention of the chosen ones and the loved ones is among the great bounties of God, exalted be His glory. In any case, through the successive bestowals of the one God, the reply to the first letter was written, and before its dispatch another letter arrived, after which attention was turned to its reply, and before the dispatch of the second, the light of the third appeared. His is the praise and the glory, and His is the grace and the bounty, for He illumines the hearts and minds of His chosen ones with the effulgent rays from the heaven of love. Although outwardly pen and paper and leaf are the means of connection and expression of love and aspiration, yet in the eyes of those endowed with insight, this is that universal connection which has moved and continues to move the world. Exalted be His grace and magnificent His favors.\n\nAs to the weakness and change of constitution that you mentioned, praise be to God that its mention and your health and well-being arrived simultaneously. The light of health dispelled the dust of mention of infirmity, giving no chance for anything of it to manifest. This too is among the signs of the Lord of all worlds' grace and favor. At this moment mention of you was made in His presence. The luminary of grace shone forth from the horizon of will, mentioning that which is the cause of the diffusion of the fragrances of boundless gifts. In all conditions, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist you in that whose traces remain eternal and enduring in the world.\n\nThe apple of the eye, Inayatu'llah, and the honored mother are, praise be to God, well and healthy. Inayatu'llah's letter arrived the day before. The servant beseeches his Lord to grant him success and assist him and make him honored among His servants. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Praise be to God, your determination is evidence of the hidden intention in your heart. Therefore, though your intentions from before, after, and now may not be visible in the outer world, there is no doubt that inwardly those saplings and trees have been planted, have sprouted, have achieved complete growth, and have been adorned with fruits and leaves. This is why He says: \"Good things are for the good ones.\" In truth, good emerges from good. Pure intentions have different influence and effects in the world. Blessed is the soul between whose intention and deed no difference is seen - whose intention is the very deed and whose deed is the very intention. And this is the station of the depths of the sea of oneness that was mentioned before.\n\nThus it was proven that your intentions regarding the grape vine or the citron or other trees are as though they are seen now. In any case, in all conditions, grace is from God, generosity is from Him, and bounty is from His presence. A hundred thousand souls be sacrificed for this exalted word revealed in the Qur'an: \"O people! Ye are the poor in your relation to God, and God is the Self-Sufficient, the Praised One.\"\n\nThe honored apple of the eye, the servant of the chosen ones, his honor Aqa Mirza Mu??afa, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all beings, sends greetings. He was greatly pleased by your mention and says: Would that eternal life were destined so that I might arise to everlasting service and always move according to the will of the chosen ones and attain to that which is befitting. Verily, God is the Powerful, the Giver, the Forgiving, the Generous. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God's assured and sincere servants.\n\n=== END BH00938 ===\n\n=== START BH00939 ===\n\nHe it is Who abideth forever in the Realm of Glory. The Cause of God hath come down upon the clouds of utterance, while they that have joined partners with Him are afflicted with a sore torment. The hosts of Divine Revelation, bearing the banners of celestial inspiration, have descended from the heaven of His Tablet in the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, and the faithful rejoice in His victory and dominion, while the deniers are filled with dismay. O people! Do ye flee from the mercy of God after it hath pervaded all that is in the heavens and on the earth? Barter not away that mercy wherewith God hath favoured you, nor withhold yourselves therefrom, for they that turn away are indeed in grievous loss. The mercy of God is like unto the verses that are sent down from one same heaven: The true believers quaff therefrom the wine of everlasting life, while the ungodly drink a scalding draught. And whensoever the verses of God are rehearsed unto them, the fire of hatred is kindled in their breasts. Thus do they barter away the bounty that God hath bestowed upon them and are reckoned among the heedless.\n\nStrive, O people, to enter beneath the sheltering shadow of the Word of God. Quaff, then, from it the choice wine of inner meaning and explanation, for it is the repository of the living waters of the All-Glorious and hath appeared from the horizon of the Will of the All-Merciful with matchless splendour. Say: Out of this Most Great Ocean there hath branched the Pre-existent Sea; blessed the one that hath attained and found repose upon its shores.\n\nThere hath branched from the Sadratu'l-Muntaha this sacred and glorious Being, this Branch of Holiness; well is it with him that hath sought His shelter and abideth beneath His shadow. Verily the Limb of the Law of God hath sprung forth from this Root which God hath firmly implanted in the Ground of His Will, and Whose Branch hath been so uplifted as to encompass the whole of creation. Magnified be He, therefore, for this sublime, this blessed, this mighty, this exalted Handiwork! Draw nigh unto Him, O people, and taste the fruits of wisdom and knowledge that have proceeded from Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Whoso hath failed to taste thereof is deprived of God's bounty, though he partake of all that the earth can produce, could ye but perceive it!\n\nA Word hath, as a token of Our grace, gone forth from the Most Great Tablet--a Word which God hath adorned with the ornament of His own Self, and made it sovereign over the earth and all that is therein, and a sign of His greatness and power among its people, that all may glorify thereby their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise, and extol the praise of their Creator and the sanctity of the Soul of God that holdeth sway over all created things. This, verily, is none other than a Word sent down by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the Ancient of Days. Render thanks unto God, O people, for His appearance; for verily He is the most great Favour unto you, the most perfect bounty upon you; and through Him every mouldering bone is quickened. Whoso turneth towards Him hath turned towards God, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from My Beauty, hath repudiated My Proof, and transgressed against Me. He is the Trust of God amongst you, His charge within you, His manifestation unto you and His appearance among His favoured servants.\n\nThus was I bidden to deliver unto you the message of God, your Creator, and I have fulfilled that whereunto I was bidden. Unto this bear witness God, and His angels, and His Messengers, and His sanctified servants. Inhale, then, the sweet savours of Paradise from its roses and be not of them that are deprived. Hasten to win your share of the grace which God hath bestowed upon you and suffer not yourselves to be veiled therefrom.\n\nWe have sent Him down in the form of a human temple. Blest and sanctified be God Who createth whatsoever He willeth through His inviolable, His infallible decree. They who deprive themselves of the shadow of the Branch are lost in the wilderness of error, are consumed by the heat of worldly desires, and are of those who will assuredly perish.\n\nO people! Hasten to enter beneath the shadow of God, that it may shield you from the blazing heat of this Day wherein none shall find shelter or refuge save under the shadow of His Name, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate. Attire yourselves, O people, with the raiment of certitude, that it may protect you from the darts of idle fancy and vain imaginings and that ye may be numbered with the faithful in these days--days wherein none may attain certitude nor achieve constancy in the Cause of God save by renouncing that which is current amongst men and by turning towards this hallowed and refulgent Beauty.\n\nO people! Will ye take a false deity for your helper rather than God? Will ye follow the Most Great Idol before your Lord, the Almighty, the Most Powerful? Forsake their mention, O people, and seize the cup of life in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful. By the righteousness of God! A single drop from this cup quickeneth all humankind, could ye but know it. Say: None shall be immune in this Day from God's decree; none shall find refuge save in Him. This, verily, is the truth, and aught else is but manifest error. God hath made it incumbent upon all to teach His Cause to the extent of their ability. Such is the decree that the Finger of might and power hath recorded in the Tablets of supernal glory. Whoso quickeneth but a single soul in this Revelation, it is as though he had quickened all humanity: Him will God, on the Day of Resurrection, raise again to life in the paradise of His oneness, adorned with the raiment of His own Self, the Sovereign Protector, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Such is the nature of the assistance ye can render to your Lord, and naught else is worthy of mention in this Day in the presence of God, your Lord and the Lord of your sires of old.\n\nAs for thee, O servant, give ear unto that which We have admonished thee in this Tablet, and seek at all times the grace of thy Lord. Disseminate this Tablet amongst them that have believed in God and in His signs, that they may observe its injunctions and be numbered with the righteous.\n\nSay: O people! Spread not disorder on the earth nor dispute with your fellow men, for this would ill beseem them that occupy, beneath the shadow of their Lord, the station of such as are faithful to the one true God. Whensoever ye encounter a thirsty soul, give him to drink from the cup of everlasting life; and whensoever ye find a hearing ear, recite unto him the verses of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Compassionate. Unloose your tongues with kindly words and, should ye find the people inclined towards the Sanctuary of God, summon them to the truth; otherwise leave them to their own selves and to that condition which is the reality of the nethermost fire. Beware lest ye cast the pearls of inner meaning before the blind and the barren in heart, inasmuch as they are deprived of beholding the light and are unable to distinguish the worthless pebble from the precious and gleaming pearl. Wert thou for a thousand years to recite unto a stone the verses of wondrous glory, would it ever be affected by them or comprehend their significance? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate! Wert thou to recite unto the deaf all the verses of God, would they hear a single letter thereof? Nay, by His ancient and glorious Beauty!\n\nThus have We imparted unto thee the gems of divine wisdom and utterance, that thou mayest fix thy gaze upon thy Lord and rid thyself of all attachment to the world. May His spirit rest upon thee and upon them that abide within the habitation of holiness and that are endued with true constancy in the Cause of their Lord.\n\n=== END BH00939 ===\n\n=== START BH00940 ===\n\nO Ahmad, I swear by the True God that His proof has been perfected upon thee and His evidence made complete against thee, wert thou of them that understand. For others have been seized by vain imaginings from the direction of self and passion, and have not heard a single letter of the Cause, and were of them that fancy on tablets well-preserved. But thou didst attain Our presence and didst witness him who warred against Us after claiming within himself that he was the Mirror of God, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Therefore bring thy presence before God and judge fairly within thyself: Hast thou witnessed from any other what thou hast witnessed from Me? Nay, by My Beauty, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Great! Indeed, wert thou fair, thou wouldst witness all else as non-existent before My holy court, such that none could speak in My presence - to this testify all created things, if thou be of them that deny.\n\nAnd ponder within thyself: Were the angels of the Cause to bring thee before thy Lord, the Most High, and ask thee: \"O servant, by what proof didst thou believe in My Self, and by what evidence didst thou turn away from My luminous, radiant Beauty?\" If thou didst believe in Me through what was revealed unto Me of the verses of God, the All-Powerful, the Sovereign, the Most High, the All-Wise - by God, these are My verses, revealed in such wise that were a single note thereof to appear as ordained, all in the heavens and earth would be struck senseless. And thou, O Ahmad - hast thou seen from another what thou hast not seen from Him? Bring thy proof and be not of the patient ones. Then would bewilderment and shame seize thee, such that thou couldst not speak in the presence of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers.\n\nBy God, O Ahmad, wert thou fair in thyself, thou wouldst find none like unto Me, nor any partner, nor in all that hath appeared from Me, if thou be of the fair-minded. Beware, beware lest thou follow thy passion. Look with the Greatest Vision and say: \"O people, by God, that which had never appeared in the worlds hath appeared!\" Purify thy heart from the allusions of the people and from all that hath barred thee from thy Lord's path, for today nothing shall profit thee, even shouldst thou cling to all things. Thou wouldst confirm Me wert thou to ponder My Cause and be of them that reflect.\n\nSay: By God, this is the Glory of the Concourse on High, His Light for them in the Kingdom of Eternity, His Word for them in the depths of Names, and His Book for all creation. By God, O Ahmad, the Spirit speaketh not from passion, but speaketh what God hath placed in his pure, crystal heart - that there is no God but He, and that Husayn-'Ali is His servant, His Glory, His Remembrance and His proof unto all between earth and heaven, if thou be of them that know.\n\nThen know that after thy departure, We left these people and dwelt alone in the house, closing the door, that perchance thereby the fire of hatred might be stilled in the breasts of the deceivers. Thou knowest that I spoke not a word with my brother nor associated with him. When there appeared from him what he desired and God revealed what was hidden in his breast, he arose with mighty calumny and wrote tablets wherein he attributed to My wronged, lonely, estranged Self what he wished within himself \\[...\\]\n\nYou know that I was a refuge in my absence from those people, and in my isolation from those who desired to kill me without proof or illuminating Book. You were with Us - did you dispute with him regarding his cause after he was secretly writing in the Tablets that which would set aflame the hearts of those drawn nigh? Apart from this, he arose to shed my blood after We had nurtured him and protected him from the evil of every evil one. And if you deny this, the Tongue of God, the True, the Faithful King bears witness to it. You knew from him what no one else knew, for the people were in doubt and thick veils. Have you forgotten what was asked of him by one of God's servants named 'Ali \\[before\\] Nabil, when he was unable to answer, and God only revealed this to awaken the heedless? Therefore, hear My words and sanctify yourself from all allusions, then reflect on what you witnessed from Me and heard about Me. Then take for yourself a path to God. Speak among the people with pure truth and with what you witnessed and saw, and be not of those who recognize God's favor and then deny it. This is My counsel to you - if you accept it, all good destined for God's righteous servants will return to you. Beware, beware lest you transgress the decree of justice, for through it the servant is raised to a station which none but the just and discerning can reach. By the True God! I sacrificed My spirit at the time when God made Himself known to Me and caused Me to speak His verses and sent Me with truth to the worlds. There was no hatred in My heart for you nor for any created thing. Rather, I love that you should detach yourself from those who have wronged and return to God, your Lord, with evident humility. We ask God to make you successful in His Cause and to give you to drink from the cup of eternity from the hand of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in My Most Glorious Name, that He may purify your heart from the whisperings of Satan and make you sincere for your Lord's sake and sever you from the idolaters. Know God through God, not through aught else, for all else was created by His Word, if you be of those who know. Beware lest you look upon Me through what is with the people. If you wish to know Me, look with My eye. This is what We have counseled you in all the Tablets, if you be of those who witness. Say: Today, nothing of what exists between the heavens and earth will profit you except that you detach yourselves from what you have and turn towards the direction of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Detach yourself from the world and what is therein, for it will never profit you. What will profit you is what has been ordained in the Kingdom of the Cause by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus have We counseled and advised you - act according to what you have been commanded and be not of the heedless ones. And if you see your brother, convey to him Our greetings, then remind him of this Great News. And the Spirit and Glory and Eternity be upon you if you board the Ark of Baha which sails upon the crimson sea by God's leave, the Creator of Names, and be of those who are firmly established.\n\n=== END BH00940 ===\n\n=== START BH00941 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!\n\nO servant! Hearken unto the Call of God, then act according to what thou art bidden by thy Lord, and be not of those who, when the Sun of Beauty dawned forth from the Horizon of Grandeur, wrapped themselves in darkness and were overcome with doubt and misgiving. Beware lest thou ascribe partners unto Him Who hath ever been One in His Essence and hath taken neither peer nor likeness unto Himself. To this beareth witness all that hath been sent down aforetime from the presence of the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily, he who was named Muhammad-'Ali, and whom God related unto His own Self, is but a leaf among the leaves of that Tree. By the True One! Were We to withdraw from him for less than a twinkling of an eye the outpourings of the divine Command, he would surely turn yellow and fall upon the dust. O servant! Dost thou sport with the Cause of God and desire to be of them who at every moment take unto themselves a lord besides Me, a god other than Me, a worshipped one other than Me, and a beloved one beyond Me? By God! Their feet have slipped and their faces have been blackened. Therefore take ye warning, O concourse of the beloved!\n\nKnow thou that I alone have ever been the Beloved of all things and the God of all who are in the heavens and on earth. I have taken no partner unto Myself in sovereignty. Thus have I been from before all beginning and will be unto the end that hath no end. Bear thou witness, then, to that whereunto God Himself hath testified, and be not of them that doubt and are veiled. We created the Son by Our command and through Our power, and caused him to speak in praise of Our Self, that the possessors of insight might remember and bear witness to the power of their Lord, and be assured that He is verily the Potent over all things. He causeth whomsoever He willeth to speak through His sovereignty, and unto Him returneth the decree of the beginning and the end.\n\nAs to those who have not attained the presence of the Throne, nor heard the melodies of God, nor been illumined by the light of Beauty - should they speak according to their vain imaginings and be veiled by their delusions, perchance God may forgive them after their return unto Him, for they were not acquainted with the foundation of the Cause and remained behind a thick veil. But thou, O servant, wert present before the Throne and didst witness with thine eyes and recognize in thy heart that every possessor of splendor boweth down before My countenance, every possessor of glory is glorified through My remembrance, every possessor of radiance shineth through My bounty, every possessor of light circleth around Me, and every possessor of authority hath appeared through My command. By God! Were thy vision to be unveiled, thou wouldst witness how all lords have prostrated themselves before the majesty of thy Lord.\n\nEvery wave that thou beholdest from this Ocean maketh mention, in its station, of the cause of its appearance being the grace of this Ocean which hath encompassed all created things. Fear God, and corrupt not the earth after its reformation. Turn wholly unto God and shun the wolves who have emerged from the thickets of malice bearing hatred and rancor toward God, and who have joined partners with Him. Thus do We teach thee the truth as a grace from Us unto thee, that thou mayest detach thyself from all the worlds and take shelter beneath this canopy.\n\nO servant! Associate not with My remembrance the remembrance of anyone among all created things, nor with My Self the self of anyone among all existing things, for all else besides Me hath been created by a mere movement of My finger. Hast thou not witnessed how every heaven hath been cleft asunder, how every earth hath been rent apart, how every moon hath been eclipsed, and how the mountains have passed away like passing clouds? Hast thou not witnessed that every prideful is as naught before the manifestations of My glory, and all possessed of might tremble in fear of Me. Fear God and make not the Cause of God a subject of mockery. Be of them who have cast behind their backs all who are in the heavens and on earth and have turned with submission and lowliness unto this Countenance that hath appeared in truth. Repent and turn unto God, and grieve not those in whose hearts thou findest the sweet fragrance of My love. Rather, lower unto them the wing of humility, purely for My sake. Verily We know that thou hast grieved him who loveth God, his Lord. With Us is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of all things in preserved tablets and books. Be thou assured that nothing escapeth Our knowledge, whether in the heavens or on earth, and not an atom moveth except by My command. All things are at all times present before My throne, recounting what is within them, what pertaineth unto them, what hath come upon them, and what hath proceeded from them. Thus hath been the command of thy Lord, as attested by such servants as have detached themselves from all directions and, through My sovereignty, have rent asunder all veils. O servant! We have answered thee before and commanded thee to associate with the loved ones in submission and lowliness, and to remind them of this Wronged One against Whom have risen up such servants as have disbelieved in God, associated partners with His Beauty, and warred against His Self, that perchance they may remember within themselves God Who created all things by His command, and unto Whom all shall return on the Day of Reckoning. We commanded thee to rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, yet thou hast increased in some souls what thou hast increased. Therefore, purify thy self, thy spirit, and thine essence from all else but Me, then remind the people with goodly counsel of this Beauty Who hath been established upon the throne of sorrows in these days and hath found no helper save His own Self, the Mighty, the Bestower. And the glory be upon thee and upon whoso hath followed the command of his Lord and remained steadfast unto Him after all souls were seized with trembling and perturbation. O Rahim! Hearken unto the most wondrous and sweet melodies from this place of supreme sorrow, and conduct thyself with the utmost courtesy and forbearance toward the servants of God. Move with pure detachment in such wise that the signs of truth may be manifest from thee. Dispute not with anyone, and remind the people with wisdom and counsel. O servant! Be adorned with My attributes, for We have lifted the decree of conflict and disputation and have manifested the Cause with power and might, without any from among the peoples of the world taking notice thereof, for power lieth in My will, not in warfare and disputation. Thus doth the tongue of thy Lord counsel thee from the direction of the Throne of Glory, that thou mayest be of them that are assured. Think not the Cause of God to be such that any soul may, in any day or hour, arise to make claims thereto. Adorn thyself with servitude unto God, the True One, alone, and be not of them who walk at every moment upon a new path. And the glory be upon thee.\n\n=== END BH00941 ===\n\n=== START BH00942 ===\n\nHe is God - exalted be His glory, His grandeur and His might!\n\nPraise be to that sovereign Lord who has raised up among the servants of the world the banner proclaiming \"Verily I am the Lord of existence.\" Through the sword of His utterance, He has freed the mute and stammering ones of the world from the darkness of names and the pit of suspicions and vain imaginings. The banner of His justice was not prevented by the oppression of the deniers, nor was His Testament of Truth followed by obliteration. Glorified be His majesty, all-pervading be His bounty, and exalted be His station! And blessings and peace be upon the Speaking Book of God and His Speaking Scripture, His manifest Mystery and His supreme, triumphant, and all-revealing Word, at whose birth the Kingdom and all therein proclaimed \"Unto God, the Lord of all worlds!\" And upon His kindred and companions, through whom the light of justice shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's grace, the Mighty, the Great - such blessings as will draw unto them all hearts and souls and cause all created things to ascend.\n\nMay my soul be a sacrifice for your steadfastness, love and service. The blessed tablet penned by the Most Pure Pen of my Lord and Master, the Most Great Branch - may my soul and being be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps - illumined the eyes of body and soul and the vision of heart and reality. Most of that blessed tablet concerned mention of His steadfastness, attention, sincerity, service and devotion. Every word thereof testified to His love and affection. In truth, the choice wine of utterance is the dawning-place of joy and the dayspring of gladness. All this is through the grace of God, our Lord and the Lord of our fathers and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. I submit one of the blessed words so that the degrees of His favor may become clear and evident. His sweetest words are: \"At present I am occupied with writing in the home of the honored Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Merciful. I am deeply abashed and affected by their troubles and love. I hope they will present this at the Most Holy Court and that mention will be made concerning them from the Source of Grace, such that will relieve this servant's embarrassment. We can do nothing greater than this for them, nor is there anything greater.\" Likewise this blessed word was recorded: \"Their presence and being in this land is necessary and serves the needs of all travelers to this region in a way that cannot be surpassed.\" Praise be to God, His traces have perfumed and illumined those regions. After submitting these matters, He spoke these words before me: \"God willing, there shall appear from my Afnan that which will guide the people to the Light that has shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of God's Will, the Master of the Day of Judgment. O my Afnan! Upon you be my peace, my remembrance and my praise.\" I beseech and we beseech God, exalted be His glory, to free and deliver His servants from names that are the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings. He is the All-Bountiful, Whose bounty the opposition of His servants has not prevented, and Whose generosity the darkness of existence has not veiled. O Afnan! This is the Day wherein the Dawn of Manifestation has unfurled its banner and the Temple of Justice its standards. Blessed are those servants who hold fast to the Truth and are detached and free from all else. This Wronged One counsels that the honored Afnan not be saddened by what has occurred. In truth, you have been and are partner with the Wronged One in the tribulations that have befallen Him. Glory be to God! God, exalted be His glory, has made the land of Shin the dawning-place of light and fire - that is, the manifestation of these two is more evident and mighty in that land before God, for the fire of corruption from the tree of opposition appeared and blazed forth in that land and city before all other lands. The arrows of the oppressors and the swords of the malicious ones who broke the Covenant and Testament and denied God's decree on the day of separation have assailed the Manifestation of Justice. These days are, in God's sight, the days of the Most Great Joy, for the Lord of Manifestation is established upon the Throne of Sinai and the call of the Blessed Tree is raised at every moment. Therefore, if the kindred are summoned from that land, it is acceptable before God and adorned with the ornament of His leave. After the sorrows that have descended, this Most Great Glad-Tidings proceeding from the Most Exalted Horizon is the cause and reason for boundless joy and delight\n\n\\[...\\] and it has been and will be. The Most Great Branch has also requested this matter. Now it accords with both consultation and conforms to His will. For a long time, this Wronged One has been thinking of them. In any case, this news is relief after distress and joy after sorrow. O Afnan! At this moment the Sun of permission has risen and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will. Give glad tidings to the Leaf and those with her on My behalf of My permission, which is the ultimate hope of the seekers and the goal of the hearts of the mystics. The glory from Us be upon you, O Afnan, and upon the son, and upon those who have believed in God and performed good deeds and what they were commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nFrom this bestowed permission, boundless joy is attained. In truth, this is a great bestowal regarding those who are wronged in the path of God. This evanescent servant has at all times beseeched and continues to beseech that He may bring forth from potentiality to the realm of manifestation the means of nearness and meeting for those who have been consumed by the fire of separation from His presence for years, and from concealment to disclosure. Verily, He is powerful over all things. It is hoped that this matter will be arranged with utmost joy and delight, and that the Causer of causes will manifest a cause that will become the source of joy for the hearts of His male and female servants. He is the Bestower, the Mighty.\n\nAs commanded, this letter must be preserved, for people are inclined to objection rather than justice and fairness. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for the Afnan of the land of Shin, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and was sent. Your honor should review it and forward it. I present my greetings to the service of the brilliant star, his honor Afnan Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, and likewise to the loved ones of that land. For all, I seek that which is the cause of the elevation of character among people and unity among the servants. Peace, remembrance, and glory be upon your honor and upon those with you, and those who love you and hear your words in their turning to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nThe Servant\n\nFirst of Rajab 1307\n\n=== END BH00942 ===\n\n=== START BH00943 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!\n\nPraise befitteth the most holy and exalted Court of the Desired One Who hath adorned the world of contingent being with the light of recognition and hath embellished the tablet of existence with the inscription \"I am He that existeth and is to be worshipped.\" He is the Omnipotent One Who hath raised high the heaven of utterance and adorned it with the stars of wisdom, Who hath made the ocean of inner meanings to be possessed of the pearls of knowledge, and Who hath perfumed the assemblage of the world with the sweet fragrances of His Most Compassionate Name. His is the praise and His the thanksgiving, His the grace and His the bounty, His the generosity and His the glory. Glory be to God! Despite this Revelation whose light hath encompassed both the seen and the unseen, and despite this Call which hath embraced both heaven and earth, no eye capable of beholding and no ear worthy of hearkening hath been found, save whom God hath willed. He is the One Whom the conditions of the world did not prevent from the Most Great Name, and Whom the allusions of the peoples did not hinder from immersion in the ocean of inner meanings. And peace and blessings be upon Him through Whom the hearts of the monotheists found rest and the hearts of the polytheists were disturbed. Every accepted one is accepted through His acceptance, and every known thing is known through His will. He is the Lord of the Prophets and the Sovereign of the chosen ones. The books of the world were sealed with His name, and the sending of Messengers was concluded with His appearance. His is the bounty and generosity in the beginning and in the return. Through His appearance the mystery of the Book was made manifest, and through His utterance the hidden meanings of the Books became clear. Through Him God sent down the proof and made manifest the way, through Him the gate of utterance was opened to all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and His ordinances were established among all religions. And upon His family and His companions who cast away all that is in the world, holding fast to the Most Great and Most Firm Cord.\n\nO God, my God, my Adored One, my King, the Self-Sufficient! Deprive not Thy friends of the ocean of awareness, nor withhold from them the vision of the rays of the Sun of Thy Manifestation. O Generous One! With but a single flame from the fire of Thy love Thou didst set aflame the world, and with but one effulgence from the lights of Thy countenance Thou didst send forth the sincere ones and those near unto Thee to the place of sacrifice. Thou art the Sovereign Whom the power of all creation hath not weakened, and Whom the might of rulers hath not held back from His purpose. Through Thy name the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" hath been raised aloft. In this darksome night, I beseech Thee to grant Thy friends their portion from the Kawthar of inner meanings, and bestow upon them their full share of eternal life. Let not the tempestuous winds extinguish Thy lamp, nor the floods of the world uproot the Tree of Thy Cause from its seat. Thy remembrance is sweeter than any honey in the mouth of them that love Thee, and Thy name more beloved and precious to them that are faithful than all that exists in the horizons. O Generous One! Protect Thy loved ones and assist them in that which is befitting. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nPraised be God that the fragrances of utterance have perfumed the world of possibility, yet its people remain heedless and deprived. This servant is bewildered at how one could be deprived of the sweet-scented breezes while standing in the midst of a rose garden. The light is manifest, the fire is ablaze, and the call is raised, yet the affairs of this fleeting world have prevented the senses from beholding, perceiving, and hearing. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to close the doors of His grace and to guide those who are lost unto the straight and firm path. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Lord of all names.\n\nThe one true God is witness that since the return of your honor, you have been remembered and have been the recipient of His special favors. This ephemeral one has been and continues to be mindful of the friends in that land. The loved ones of God are as one soul, though they appear to be many, for all hold fast to the sure handle and are turned unto Him, turning away from all else. For all I seek divine confirmation and assistance, that they may all be adorned with the greatest steadfastness in such wise that nothing shall prevent them from God, their Creator, their Provider, their Sustainer, their Supporter, their Helper, and their Protector.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the newborn child, upon him be God's peace, it was presented, and in the Book of Names he was designated and honored as Badi' Effendi. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that He may open the doors of His bounties and blessings upon your honor, and shower the wonders of His favors like abundant rain. Verily, He has power over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nYour shipment of (19 F), two boxes of sweets, and nine containers of rice arrived on the day the palace became the residence, was presented, and was accepted and honored. Praise be to God that you were assisted to achieve that which the people of the world, despite their pleading, supplication, and waiting, remained deprived of. Praise be unto Him in all conditions. And peace be upon you and upon God's sincere servants.\n\nThe Servant\n\n24th of the blessed month of Ramadan 1302\n\n=== END BH00943 ===\n\n=== START BH00945 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who calleth betwixt earth and heaven! This is a remembrance from Us unto him who hath turned unto Him Who is the One Remembered, when the Promise came to pass and the Promised One appeared with manifest sovereignty. This is a Day wherein none save Him is mentioned. To this testify the Books of God, both of the past and of the future, and this mighty Tablet. This is a Day wherein the Ocean of Utterance hath surged and the Horizon of Knowledge hath shone forth, inasmuch as the Ancient King hath mounted the Most Great Throne and the Dove of Utterance hath warbled upon the highest branches. The Owner hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nThy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant who standeth before His Face hath presented it. We answer thee with verses which, when sent down from the heaven of proof, all the books of the earth bowed down before them. To this testifieth He Who speaketh in every condition, that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Generous. Be thou a speaker of My remembrance, turn thy face unto the lights of My countenance, hold fast unto My cord, and arise to serve My Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We have caused thee to hear, and have acquainted thee, and have shown thee, and have guided thee unto My straight path. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, and my Support, for having called me unto Thyself and given me to drink the cup of Thy presence from the hand of Thy bounty, and made me turn toward Thy most exalted horizon when the learned ones of all the earth turned away therefrom. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs, and by the Name through which the Ship of Utterance hath sailed upon the ocean of names, to make me in all conditions a speaker of Thy praise amongst Thy servants, in such wise that neither the assault of the Pharaohs nor the power of the tyrants shall prevent me. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.\n\nWe had made thee hear the verses of thy Lord in a perspicuous Arabic tongue, and now We desire to make thee hear them in a wondrous Persian tongue. If the people of the earth were to become aware of the greatness of this Day and the greatness of this Cause, all would detach themselves from all else save God and turn unto the Most Great Ocean which hath appeared before the faces of all peoples. The vain imaginings of men have debarred them from the Lord of all days. Every group hath clung to an idle fancy and hath been deprived of the light of the Sun of certitude. For twelve hundred years and more they have occupied themselves with cursing and reviling one another. Fellowship and unity have vanished while discord is evident. Each party hath chosen a way for itself and each people hath devised a path. Were ye to count the ways of vain imaginings, ye could not reckon them. Verses have been sent down in such wise as to encompass the world, and the evidences of His banners have been raised high and made manifest in the Tablet to Ra'is and the Surihs to the Kings. The power of the Most Exalted Pen and the potency of the Most Sublime Word are clear and evident to them that are endowed with insight and them that dwell in the Most Great Paradise. From the beginning of the Cause this Wronged One, alone and without any veil or covering, called out with His loudest voice unto the rulers and ministers and divines and jurisprudents and philosophers, summoning all to the Most Sublime Horizon. Nevertheless, the heedless and ignorant servants have not awakened nor drunk from the ocean of knowledge. From the beginning of creation until now no Revelation like unto this hath appeared. To this testify the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. This Day hath ever been specially designated with God. Most wondrous of all is the heedlessness of the servants and the tyranny of them that dwell in the lands. We beseech God not to deprive His servants of the outpourings of the Day of Retribution, nor to withhold from them the hearing of His Word and the beholding of His Horizon. May He open the gate of justice with the key of grace, make manifest them that are endued with equity, and adorn them with the most great steadfastness, that perchance they may deliver the people from ignorance and lead them unto the truth. His is the command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nWe make mention of thy brother who hath been named Mahdi and give him the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all the worlds. O Mahdi! Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One. From the earliest days until now He hath been afflicted in the hands of the enemies - that which hath caused the dwellers of the All-Highest Paradise to weep and the inhabitants of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament. This Wronged One biddeth thee ponder upon the Seal of the Prophets. There befell Him that which melted the hearts of them that are nigh unto God and the hearts of the sincere ones. For them that have ears to hear, one verse sufficeth: \"And there came not unto them any Messenger but they did mock at him.\" Reflect upon Jesus, Son of Mary. The tyranny reached such a pass that God, exalted be His glory, took Him up unto the fourth heaven. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One, and sanctify thine ears from what thou hast heard, and likewise thine eyes. Then with a sanctified ear and eye of fairness, see and hear. The verses are present in every station and the evidences are clear and manifest. Its traces shine forth like unto the sun, yet only the fair-minded are blessed to behold its lights. Today the Speaker on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation and speaketh: Blessed is he that hath heard and seen, and woe unto the heedless ones.\n\nAnd in this station We make mention of thy daughter and We beseech God to assist her and make her steadfast in His love. Verily He is potent over all things. O handmaiden of God! The whole world was brought from nothingness into being for the recognition of the Ancient Beauty, and this blessed Day was promised in all the Books, Tablets and Scriptures. The divines of Persia occupied themselves day and night with the mention of the Lord of all mankind, and from their pulpits they uttered \"May God hasten His advent\"; yet when the world was illumined with the lights of the Orb of His Manifestation, all arose in opposition, and finally pronounced the death sentence against His blessed Person. But thou, through His grace, mercy and loving-kindness, didst turn unto Him and didst drink from the choice wine of His love. Know thou the value of this station and of him who guided thee - that is, the one who showed thee the way and made thee aware. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: Thine be the praise, O Lord of Names, and Thine be the glory, O Possessor of bounty, for having guided me unto Thy path, and made me know the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-place of Thy clear tokens, and for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy love through Thy gracious hands. I beseech Thee to ordain for me, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy handmaidens as have held fast to the cord of Thy commandments and the rope of Thy behests. Thou art He the tongue of grandeur hath testified to Whose power. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be. Verily, unto God do we belong and unto Him do we return.\n\n=== END BH00945 ===\n\n=== START BH00946 ===\n\nPraise be to the Beloved of the worlds that His Holiness arrived at the designated place in perfect health and with the utmost joy and delight. Well said indeed: \"A moon took flight from this city and went to another city, such that from its rising and setting two cities were turned upside down.\" For the friends in this land were in separation and the friends in that land attained reunion. Every time has its portion and every land has had and will have its share. In all conditions I beseech and hope for His endless favors, that He may gladden and illumine the horizons of the hearts of the beloved ones through His presence. In any case, His letter which was written to this servant was presented to His blessed presence in the known palace. They smiled at its Turkish verses and said that God willing, they should be occupied with the mention of Truth and the promotion of His Cause in all languages and in all directions. Regarding what you wrote about his honor, the Name of God 66, upon him be all His most glorious Beauty, you should likewise convey on behalf of this servant utmost humility, submission, glorification, praise and infinite thanksgiving. A few days ago he specially attained the presence and whatever needed to be done was done on his behalf, and this servant himself has submitted a detailed petition to him which God willing will be sent. Another letter from him addressed to His Holiness arrived after the departure of that Beloved One. Since this servant had permission from His Holiness, it was opened and read. It contained nothing new. According to His command, all letters that arrive for His Holiness should be answered and sent, and even to those from whom letters are not received, they should write, for news from this land is the cause and means of growth for the divine saplings. However, beseech God to protect those saplings from the poisonous winds. And regarding what was written about his honor Anis, upon him be the Glory of God 69, truly all hearts were gladdened - that is, all souls who are now circling around were moved to praise and thank God with the utmost joy and delight. Although such matters are not and have never been novel for the friends of Truth - they have ever been oppressed - this servant, though confident of his protection, safety and release from prison, nevertheless upon receiving your glad tidings, my spirit nearly took flight from joy at what I heard. They said: O Anis! By My life, what befell thee God hath made a source of honor, nobility and glory for thee. Be thou thankful to God for this. Verily He is the Deliverer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Those who judged thee shall soon find themselves in manifest loss. By My life, they followed their passions and are moved by every wind, having neglected what they were commanded in the Books of God, the Manifest, the All-Informed. They wronged thee even as they wronged thy Lord before thee. Lo, they are among the perishing ones. Be thou assured and certain that His mention of thee is the most great victory and shall endure as long as the names of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. The glory be upon thee and upon him who was patient in God, the Lord of the worlds. End.\n\nConvey greetings and praise to all the friends in that land who are occupied with the remembrance of God for God's sake and are detached from all else. This servant submits to the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Siyyid Yahya, upon him be Baha'u'llah, that if this servant's letters are delayed or if inner sincerity is not outwardly expressed, let them not think that this servant has forgotten. Most times have been spent remembering that honored one, both outwardly and inwardly. God willing, may you remain radiant and luminous like the morning star in the heaven of truth from the horizon of divine love, and be at rest under His protecting shade.\n\nTo his honor Haji Husayn, upon him be Baha'u'llah, this evanescent servant expresses sincere devotion and most wondrous praise. God willing, his reply will be sent. Praise be to God Who enabled him to remember Him and serve His Cause. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nWhat else can I say regarding Haji Muhammad Isma'il, upon him be Baha'u'llah, as I feel boundless embarrassment. He has been and will continue to be mentioned in the holy presence, and since his efforts have been borne for God's sake, they have not and will not be forgotten. We beseech God to assist him and grant him what he loves and is pleased with.\n\nAs for the matter of the shawls that they had written about, that honored one did not write details about how they should be sent. Keeping them here is not advisable as they might be lost. That beloved one should write where and how they should be sent. These days his honor Ha, upon him be Baha'u'llah, has sought to buy them, but his honor Amin is not agreeable. The matter is now pending. If they are given to them, that beloved one will be informed, but in any case that honored one should write details about how they should be sent, as they might not pass with his honor Ha. In any case, as commanded, whatever you deem advisable in these matters should be carried out. However it turns out is fine. God willing, may they ever be joyous and at rest under the shade of divine favor, mercy, compassion, grace, gifts and kindness. Upon you be all the glory that has shone forth and appeared from the horizon of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. This servant, on behalf of all the friends in this land, expresses to that honored one limitless devotion, self-effacement and praise.\n\nAnother submission regarding the dye that his honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be Baha'u'llah, had written about: since his honor Haji Mulla 'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah, knows good dye, therefore one pound should be obtained and sent. So far no news has been received. And further, that beloved one should obtain and send 4 containers of two pounds of Egyptian red sugar.\n\nThe Servant\n\n12 Shawwal 1294\n\n=== END BH00946 ===\n\n=== START BH00947 ===\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou beholdest my state and hearest my cry, and Thou knowest what Thy servants have wrought against us in Thy dominion - how they have driven us from our homes and native lands after seizing us, plundering our possessions, slaying our loved ones, taking our families captive, violating Thy sanctity in us, increasing in their wickedness and multiplying in their unbelief until they stretched forth their hands against all who believed in Thee and Thy signs. The matter reached such a pass that the cries of the distressed, the lamentations of the sincere, and the wailing of them that are nigh unto Thee ascended to Thee from every city. Thereafter Thy chosen ones were scattered throughout Thy lands and wandered through Thy realms. Months and years passed thus, until the Sacred City was raised up through the mystery of Thy Most Bountiful Name. Therein was built Thy House, its doors were opened to all in the heavens and earth, and through it Thou didst guide Thy servants until honored servants and righteous men gathered round about it. All occupied themselves with wondrous remembrance of Thee and the promotion of Thy Cause, detaching themselves from all else but Thee, turning unto Thee, shunning all save Thee. While they were in this most exalted condition and supreme gift, the breezes of Thy decree stirred and the winds of Thy providence were set in motion, until the clouds of trials were raised up and the mists of tribulation poured down novel afflictions and fresh calamities. Thereby were they scattered after having been gathered, their souls were troubled, their hearts effaced, their bodies shaken, their frames agitated, their hearts saddened, their eyes shed tears, their cheeks were bathed in tears, their very beings were consumed, their essence melted away, their pillars crumbled, and their realities were rent asunder. While they were in this great sorrow and supreme calamity, Thy decisive command came for the departure of Thy Most Great Name from among these peoples and the departure of the Dove from among the loved ones. By Thy might, O my God and my Master! The life of Thy loved ones was thereby transformed and matters became so difficult for them that all power of patience and forbearance was wrested from their hands, and they were brought to such a state that the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the dwellers of the crimson pavilions in the realms of eternity wept over them, tears flowed from the eyes of the Maids of Heaven in their lofty chambers, and all in earth and heaven grieved in their sorrow. By Thy might, O my God! The Pen of Creation is powerless to record their state and what befell them in their separation and remoteness from Thee, and utterance fails to describe what they endured in their distance from Thy presence after their yearning to meet Thee, their intimacy with Thy beauty, and their wont to attend the seats of Thy majesty. Alas, alas for what befell them in Thy days and descended upon them in Thy dispensation! Therefore, O my God, since Thou hast removed them from Thy beauty, remove them not from the sweet-scented breezes of Thy holiness, and since Thou hast deprived them of Thy presence, deprive them not of the stations of Thy revelation and inspiration. I beseech Thee by this Day wherein Thou didst shine upon all contingent things with the lights of Thy Essence and didst transcend all created things through the manifestations of Thy names and attributes - the Day wherein the breezes of Thy grace wafted, the seas of Thy mercy surged, the Dove of Thy love warbled, and the clouds of Thy tender mercy rained down - to clothe their frames in the robe of Thy glorious forgiveness, to provide them with the fruits of Thy bounty and favor, then to inscribe their names among those who fulfilled Thy covenant and responded to all that Thou didst call them to in the morn of Thy Cause. Then accept from them, O my God, that which they \\[...\\] in Thy days in discharging Thy right and \\[...\\]\n\nthen raise them, O my God, to such heights that neither the distractions of the times nor trials in Thy presence shall turn them aside. Then open their eyes, O my God, that they may know Thee above all else, and purify their ears, O my Beloved, that they may distinguish Thy holy melodies from all other sounds. Thou, verily, art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Most Exalted Name and by this Name which none among all created things hath attained unto the heaven of its knowledge, to make firm our steps in Thy love and Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the One possessed of great bounty and mighty sovereignty. Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! Thou seest what hath befallen me in this journey wherein I have migrated from Thee unto Thee, and what hath transpired in the paths of Thy good-pleasure and the ways that lead to Thy contentment, and how the fire of jealousy and hatred hath been kindled in the hearts of Thy servants, though I desired for them naught save what I desired for myself, and preferred them in all things to mine own self and being. Wherefore, O my God, send down upon them that which may quiet the fire of their souls and hearts, and grant them of the fruits of Thy love from this Garden which Thou hast created for Thine own Self and manifested for Thine own Being, that their breasts and hearts may be illumined thereby and their souls be purified, for they are poor before Thee and possess neither benefit nor harm, neither life nor resurrection for themselves. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou knowest, O my God, that I do not complain of my harm and distress, nor of all that hath befallen me in Thy path, for I swear by Thy might that I yearn for Thy torment and Thy fire because of their relation to Thee, and Thy light for its guidance unto Thee, and in this station these two matters are judged alike due to the manifestation of the signs of Thy glorious oneness and the dawning of the lights of Thy holy uniqueness. Is there, O my God, any ordainer besides Thee that I might complain of him? Is there any illuminator other than Thee that I might rejoice in him? Nay, by Thy might! Rather, all hath appeared from Thee and been originated by Thy command and come to pass by Thy will. Since this is so, it behooveth not those who have recognized Thy unity among Thy creation and those who are near to Thee among Thy creatures to flee when the winds of Thy decree blow or to be dismayed when the signs of Thy trials appear. Rather, they must witness in all things the signs of the glory of Thy favors and the tokens of the sanctity of Thy bounties. This, verily, is the station of those among Thy servants who know Thee, the seat of those among Thy creation who have attained unto Thee, and the homeland of those among Thy creatures who love Thee. Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of the glory of Thy holy Oneness to deprive not Thy servants of this station and withhold them not from this sacred sanctuary. Then grant us the good of this world and the hereafter, and honor us with the presence of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Judgment. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\n=== END BH00947 ===\n\n=== START BH00948 ===\n\nRevealed for Siyyid Hasan that he may read it and be numbered among those who remember in the Mother Book. He is the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting!\n\nThe Call of God hath been raised from the right hand of the Ridvan with a Voice which all things between earth and heaven can hear, proclaiming: \"I am God, there is no God but Me, the One, the Single, the Unique!\" O peoples of the earth, stop not your ears from hearkening to the Word of God in these days, but turn with pure and sanctified hearts toward the Holy Court. Come ye forth from the city of fancy and imitation, then enter the Ridvan of Divine Unity. This is what ye have been commanded in all the Tablets from God, the All-Knowing, the Single, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nSanctify yourselves from the veils of desire that ye may hear the Call of God from the Tree raised up at the Gate, that this is the Beauty of Glory and Mystery of the All-Merciful, Who hath appeared in human temple and uttereth what was treasured in the Bayan from the presence of the Mighty, the Trustworthy. Bear witness, O people, that there is no God but Him, and that He is the Chosen One in all that He willeth. Nothing can prevent Him from that which He hath created between earth and heaven, and He bestoweth mercy upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants without limit or count.\n\nSay: The heaven hath come with the smoke of trial, and the people are covered by the veils of test, and on that day dominion shall be God's alone, in Whose hand is the Kingdom of all things, and Who hath taken neither partner nor offspring.\n\nSay: The essence of knowledge in these days is the knowledge of God and the Manifestation of His Self. Whoso hath attained unto these twain hath attained unto all good, and whoso hath turned away from them shall not be mentioned before God nor be counted. This is of the knowledge that changeth not throughout the eternity of God, while all else changeth according to His Will and His Command. Thus hath the Dove warbled, then trilled:\n\nBeware lest ye be veiled at the time of the Manifestation by anything created between the heavens and earth, and be not of those who are veiled by the veils of limitation and thereby kept from the seat of Divine Unity, and are among those who have deprived themselves of the meeting with God and fled from His mercy.\n\nThen after, O loved ones of God, leave behind all who are in the heavens and earth. Doth not God, Who created all things by His Command, suffice you? There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and in His grasp are the measures of all things, which He sendeth down according to a fixed degree.\n\nVerily those who have denied the signs of God and His proof, and then His grandeur and His sovereignty - these have no station before God, and He shall soon punish them with extended pillars.\n\nO people, preserve yourselves from the touch of Satan and his manifestations, for they have spread throughout the earth and sit in wait on every path and lookout. Hold fast to God's grace and mercy that He may preserve you from the hosts of rejection. There is no preserver but Him. He preserveth whom He willeth by His sovereignty and aideth those who believe with marshalled hosts.\n\nNothing escapeth His knowledge, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of what was and what will be, in a Book inscribed by the Finger of Destiny. That which is ordained therein neither perisheth nor endeth.\n\nO people! Believe in God and His signs, and when the Sun of Glory dawneth upon you from the horizon of grandeur in the days of your Lord, the Most High, fall prostrate upon your faces before God and be ye among those who have bowed down and prostrated themselves, and know that whatsoever ye have been commanded in the revealed verses of God and His Book concerning the recognition of His Self and obedience to His commandments - this is that which shall profit your souls in the hereafter and in this world. Verily, He is independent of all who are in the heavens and on earth, and sanctified from all that is mentioned and witnessed. Hath there been created in all possibility aught sweeter than the remembrance of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted? Nay, by the Self of Baha! Therefore, O people, detach yourselves from all things and find solace in the Most Great Remembrance, and cleave not unto any polytheist who hath denied God. Thus have We expounded unto you the truth and detailed the verses, lest ye be of them who have adopted for themselves a cause and clung to it in such wise that were the Spirit to cast upon them that which they possess not, they would arise in opposition and be numbered with them who have denied and turned aside. Say: God teacheth whomsoever He willeth that which shall guard him from the darts of ignorance and draw him nigh unto the wellspring of wisdom and grace, that he may be numbered with them who have known their Lord and then given thanks. Say: O people, adorn yourselves with the attributes of God, then beautify your beings and your temples with the raiment of knowledge and refinement, and with forgiveness and justice. Be ye united in the Cause of God and His ways, and when anyone is given aught, whether in matters of religion or of the world, be ye content therewith and be not of them who transgress and envy. Verily, envy is a fire that consumeth first the envious one, then those who draw nigh unto him, and there existeth not on earth any fire more intense than this, as would be attested by all who are informed of what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty and have borne witness. O people, be content with what God hath ordained, then take advantage of the repast of knowledge that hath descended upon you from the clouds of grace, and be not of them who have recognized God's favor and then denied it. By God! There have fallen upon Me from the swords of envy such as none can reckon save God, Who hath numbered all things, and verily He is the All-Knowing, the Truth. He knoweth what occureth to the hearts of His servants and what lieth concealed in the breasts of them who have denied and associated partners with God from all eternity unto all eternity. O people, purify your hearts from rancor and envy, and your vision from all veils and soreness of eye, that ye may witness the craftsmanship of God Who hath perfected the creation of all things in this Holy, Pure, and Glorious Tablet. Thus hath shone forth from the horizon of exposition the Sun of wisdom and utterance, that ye may know the paths of truth and testify in your hearts and openly that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the Peerless, the Unique, the Self-Subsisting. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon them who have taken hold of the Book of God with strength from Him and were among those who have bowed down and prostrated themselves.\n\n=== END BH00948 ===\n\n=== START BH00949 ===\n\nHe is God, the Most High, the Most Exalted!\n\nYour letter has come before Us, and We have answered you with truth as a mercy from Us unto you, that you may be thankful for the grace of God, your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Praise be to God Who has preserved you through the truth, given you life through His breaths, and protected you from the idolaters. This is a favor greater than all greatness and mightier than all might. Know your worth in having attained this most mighty, most glorious, and impregnable station. Were you to possess all the gold of the heavens and earth but not attain to this grace, it would profit you not at all. Thus do We testify, that you may be among those who know. Were you to rule over all upon which the sun shines, but know not God in this Revelation, you would be poorer than any poor one, for the wealth and independence of a servant lie in his knowledge of God; without this he shall not be mentioned and shall be more remote than any remote one.\n\nBe grateful to God for having attained this most great station and for having won the recognition of the Manifestation of His Self among the worlds. Be steadfast in God's Cause, then remain firm, for this is indeed a great favor. Be illumined by the effulgences of this Sun which has risen from the horizon of Revelation with a brilliant and radiant light, that you may be enlightened among the servants. Thus have We ordained for you in the Tablets, that you may be among those who know. Deprive not yourself of the favor We have ordained for you in the heaven of exalted glory. Beware that you grieve not over anything, for grief befits those who are heedless of God, their Lord, and are among the dead. He who is alive with the life of his Lord and has entered the kingdom of immortality shall find nothing lost to him that he should grieve for it, and shall find all he desires in an instant. Thus is it ordained for God's sincere servants. Rejoice and be not sad, for We have given you in this Tablet glad tidings most great, if you but knew what has been sent down therein from your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nWe have ordained for you in the Tablets what you desired, that you may be assured that the Cause is in the grip of His power. He ordains what He willeth for whom He willeth, and He is verily the Forgiving, the Generous. Be enkindled with the fire of your Lord's love and be of such a station that whosoever associates with you will find in you the traces of your Lord. Thus ought it to be with Our triumphant servants.\n\nAs to what you asked of God, your Lord, that He make you not dependent on His creatures: He has heard your call and fulfilled your need. He is verily the Fulfiller of the needs of all who ask. Follow what you have been commanded in the Tablets as a grace from Him, and be not of the heedless ones. Should He wish, He could fulfill the needs of all men and jinn in less than a moment, for He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling. Attend to your affairs, for God loves not a servant who walks the earth without engaging in some occupation. He has refused to cause things to happen except through their means, and thus has it been ordained in the Tablets of mighty preservation. Say: O servants of the All-Merciful! Engage yourselves in some occupation or craft. Thus has God willed in this most impregnable and wondrous Revelation. And you, occupy yourself with your work, then put your trust in God. He will send down to you what He has ordained for you, and He is the best of ordainers.\n\nAs for what thou hast beseeched God throughout thy life, He hath ordained for thee what He hath willed. Be thou assured in thy soul and be of the thankful ones. Verily, He giveth unto whomsoever He willeth through His grace, and increaseth unto whomsoever He pleaseth among His creatures. He, verily, is powerful over all things. Beware lest thou grieve over aught. Stand firm in the Cause, then rest assured in the bounty of thy Ancient Lord. He hath been with thee and hath aided thee in numerous instances, if thou be of those who know. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and the earths.\n\nAs for thy question concerning those who passed away before this Revelation, know thou that they abide in a paradise of exalted glory. Those who believed in the Point of the Bayan have indeed attained unto God and His presence. Whosoever among them died hath ascended unto God and entered the paradise of grace, whereupon he sayeth: \"Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled His promise and hath caused me to inherit a paradise whose breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth.\" Thus was the matter decreed in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Thus did the matter continue until the Beauty of the Primal One appeared once again with manifest sovereignty. Then all matters returned to the grasp of His power, and in His right hand was the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and the earths. Whoso hath hesitated regarding Him hath indeed turned away from the Path and hath rejected God and the Manifestations of His Cause from among the Prophets and Messengers. No deed shall be accepted from him, even should he perform the deeds of both races, nor shall aught profit him, even should he recite the entire Bayan at all times. Thus hath it been sent down in truth from the heaven of God, the Most High, the Most Great. For verily the Bayan and all that is therein were revealed for this Manifestation, if ye be of the assured ones.\n\nHe who dieth in a state of rejection, by God the Truth, is assuredly among the companions of the Fire - nay, the Fire itself fleeth from him and Hell itself seeketh to escape from him. Never shall he inhale the fragrance of holiness, and God shall chastise him with a punishment that hath no equal in creation, nor any likeness or comparison. Say: O people! Fear ye God and oppose not Him Who hath come to you from the Dayspring of Revelation through the inspiration of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Whosoever today desireth the Primal Point, behold, He is this One - witness ye this, O company of seekers! And whosoever desireth to hear the Bayan, say: Hearken unto that which hath been revealed from His presence as a favor unto you and unto God's monotheistic servants. Say: All things have been created for My sake, if ye be of those who know. Say: O people of the Bayan! The Chosen One took from you the covenant of My Self in the atoms of the Bayan before the mention of His own Self. Beware lest ye break God's covenant, for whoso breaketh it is indeed in manifest loss.\n\nThus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth as a mercy from Our presence and a remembrance unto all the worlds. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon thy son who hath believed in God and whom adversity and tribulation have touched in his Lord's path. Say: Grieve not, for He is with thee and hath ordained for thee a station of glorious honor. Take comfort in My loved ones, then shun Mine enemies and be thou of sure certainty. Then convey Our glorification unto thy other son as a bounty from Our presence unto thee and unto him, that he may be of the thankful ones. And mercy from Our presence be upon Our sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00949 ===\n\n=== START BH00950 ===\n\nThe Most Holy, the Most Glorious\n\nThe Book of God hath been sent down in truth - verily it is a perspicuous Book. It proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\" O people, follow not your selfish desires, but follow Him Who hath come with His mighty and impregnable Kingdom. Beware lest ye invalidate the truth with what ye possess. Blessed is he who soareth in the atmosphere of justice and pondereth upon this wondrous Cause. The Spirit proclaimeth by His sovereignty: \"The sovereignty of God hath been manifested, were ye of those who know.\" And the Beloved declareth by His arising: \"The Hour hath come, were ye of the fair-minded.\" The Lord of the Bayan proclaimeth that He is the Best-Beloved of the worlds. He hath come at a time when no one among men had expected His mention, and this is His proof, were ye of those who know. He is the One Whose manifestation none hath known save His own Self. To this testify all atoms and beyond them the Tongue of God, the True One, the Trustworthy. God hath made His Day transcend understanding, even as His own Self transcendeth comprehension. Thus hath the decree been sent down from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. This is the Manifestation which none hath known save he who hath cast away what the people possess and turned wholly unto the Countenance of God, the Radiant, the Luminous. Among the people are those who say: \"He hath appeared differently from what we expected.\" Say: Thus must it be, by your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And among the people are those who say: \"He hath appeared too soon.\" Say: This is His proof, were ye of the discerning ones. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful and speak not that which would cause the hearts of them who are nigh unto God to burn. He hath come as He willeth. The command is in God's hands - He ordaineth what He pleaseth. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Look ye at what He possesseth, not at what ye possess. This is what We counsel you in the Tablets. Read them and follow not the ways of the calumniators. Say: If ye deny Him Who speaketh between earth and heaven, unto whom will ye turn? Consider, if ye be of the truthful. Have ye not heard that He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth? I was silent; the Truth made Me speak. I was seated; He raised Me up for His firm and mighty Cause. Were the matter in My hands, I would have veiled My face from all on earth, but God hath manifested Me in truth. Verily He is the Powerful, the Trustworthy. Say: O people of the Bayan! The All-Merciful Himself calleth you, yet ye are as the dead. Ye object to Him through Whom the breeze of God hath wafted over all things, and by Whom the eyes of the Messengers have been solaced. Your objection returneth not unto Me but unto God, were ye aware of it. Your hatred falleth not upon Me but upon God - to this testifieth every fair-minded and clear-sighted one. Hearken ye unto the Call from the Most Glorious Tree upon the Crimson Spot: \"Verily there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\" Turn not unto those who point to what was decreed in former ages, nor hearken unto the tales they tell you of what hath passed. Hearken ye unto the Call of your Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Ponder what We have sent down in truth that ye may perchance know God's purpose and follow that which ye have been commanded in His Book, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Say: The seas have surged, the trees have yielded their fruits, the rains have fallen, the birds have sung their songs, yet ye walk in the wilderness of ignorance. The Sun hath testified to this resplendent Light, and the atoms have proclaimed this Name that dominateth all who are in the heavens and on earth. The Rock hath cried out to the Lord of all creation, yet ye remain heedless. The Dominion hath been adorned with the stars of utterance, and the Kingdom with this wondrous Remembrance, \\[...\\] and the horizons were illumined by the light of His countenance, yet ye are among those who turn aside. Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye object to Him through Whom religions have appeared and the Cause of the All-Merciful hath been established? This is naught but grievous wrong. In the midst of supreme tribulation He calleth all created things, as witnessed by all things, if ye be of them that hear. Do ye imagine yourselves to be the guides? Nay, by My Most Glorious Beauty! Do ye reckon yourselves among those who have witnessed and seen? Nay, by the Self of God Who dominateth all things great and small! This day ye are blind and deaf, thus hath the All-Merciful testified, and no testimony in all the worlds can equal His testimony. Ye have believed in your own vain imaginings and followed what your desires commanded you. This is naught but manifest transgression. Had ye perceived the fragrance of the All-Merciful, ye would not have denied this bounty which hath appeared in human form. Blessed is He Who sent Him with the truth and caused Him to speak forth a Word that made the limbs of the idolaters quake. Trample under foot the head of him who led you astray, and turn ye towards the Dawning-Place of your Lord's revelation, the Mighty, the Peerless. Say: Beware lest ye be among those who turned away from the Known and followed the conjectural, and were of them that wander. Consider the people of the Furqan, who await that which was promised them, even after the moon was cleft by the fingers of Him Who ruleth destiny, and the heaven was rent asunder, and the All-Merciful came upon clouds of light, and the heavens and earth were illumined. They rejected Him Who came with the signs of the All-Merciful, following instead the people of perdition who were occupied with their own desires and were among the losers. Turn your ears that ye may hear the call of God. By God! The Self-Subsisting calleth you from a manifest horizon, if ye be of them that know. Do ye reject Him behind your backs and turn to your own desires? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! At My call the pebbles were stirred and the atoms cried out: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Praiseworthy!\" Be fair in God's name and oppose not Him Who was promised you in the Tablets of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. Were ye to read the Bayan, ye would know what hath been sent down from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Thus doth the Pen of Revelation command you from One All-Knowing, All-Informed. O thou who gazeth upon the Face, hearken unto what We counsel thee and be of the thankful. Recite the verses of thy Lord to them that are there of the loved ones of thy Master, that perchance the breezes of revelation may cause them to be among those who are steadfast in the Cause and are firmly rooted. Should thou find objectors among the people of the Bayan, deliver unto them what We have revealed to thee from the heaven of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, that they may perchance be awakened by God's call and turn with radiant faces toward the Dayspring of the Cause. Be thou a servant of thy Master's Cause in all conditions. This will profit thee in the hereafter and in this world. He is with His remembering servants. Thou art in the House while thy Lord hath turned toward thee from this distant Prison and revealed for thee that which hath diffused the fragrances of the Beloved. Blessed is he who hath found and hath said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Wronged One of the worlds!

He honored and established the darkness of the existence of created things through the encounter with absolute existence, that all beings, both seen and unseen, might not be deprived of His all-encompassing mercy nor be excluded from the ascendancy of the throne of justice. In every existence He ordained a symbol, and from every symbol He established a command, that the pure essences of the abstract realities of all created things might move with diverse motions, so that His celestial dominion might become manifest and evident in the realm of earthly existence. Upon every thing He bestowed its season, and according to its capacity He conferred power, and thereafter He presented the command of what is permitted and forbidden, that the rebellion and faith of all might be made known, that they might attain unto the fruits of their deeds and actions, and that they might be rewarded according to what they have earned. Luqman said to his son Nathan: \"O my son! If it be but the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily, God is subtle and informed.\" How can anyone find escape or refuge? All are captive in the grasp of His power, even as the secret of destiny and the word of fulfillment - the Prince of Believers hath said: \"Every thing is captive in the grasp of Thy power, and that, verily, is easy for Thee. Glorified be He in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and Who hath power over all things.\"\n\nO my God, my Master and my Hope!

How can I behold the signs of Thy intimacy with these eyes that are blind to the perception of the garments of the Beauty of the King of Thine eternity? How can I hear Thy sweet melodies with these ears that are deaf to the warbling of the Dove of Thine everlastingness? How can I comprehend the subtleties of Thy wondrous wisdom with this mind that is bewildered before the manifestations of the designs of Thy Self-Subsisting Lordship? How gracious is Thy generosity and mercy that hath encompassed the essence of all created things! How wondrous is Thy compassion and loving-kindness that hath embraced the highest degrees of contingent being! Thou art sanctified beyond the description of every pure essence, and exalted above the praise of all that is holy and sacred. All attributes in Thy holy presence are mere falsehood, and every description in the realm of Thy intimacy is sheer deception. Thou hast ordained no path for anyone to know Thee except through utter powerlessness, and decreed no refuge for any soul except absolute nothingness.\n\nMy God! Tongues fall short of attaining to Thy praise, and minds are powerless to comprehend the essence of Thy beauty. Despite all this inadequacy and inability, I call upon Thee with the call of Thy chosen ones, saying: O my Sovereign and my Beloved! Grant assurance to the heart of this evanescent atom through its return to Thy eternal Countenance. Illumine my eyes with the vision of the beauty of Thy All-Bountiful Self. Bestow upon me drops of joy from the fountains of Thy light, and grant me crystalline effusions from Thy crystal chalices. From the pools of love, with the hand of gentleness, bestow the wine of intimacy, that my heart may find repose in the presence of Thy Beloved Self, and my mind may be thunderstruck upon the carpet of the sovereignty of Thy rapture.\n\n\\[...\\] yesterday, and in the end Thou didst deliver me into the hands of the wrathful and those wielding tyrannical might. Many a night I found no rest from the weight of chains and fetters, and many a day I had no peace from the assaults of hands and tongues. For a time they denied me the food and water which Thou, in Thy bountiful mercy, hadst made lawful even to the beasts of the field, and they permitted against this servant what was not permitted against rebels, until at last the decree of fate was fulfilled and the command was executed for this servant's departure from Iran, together with a group of feeble souls and young children. At this time, when the severity of cold makes speech impossible and the abundance of ice and snow prevents movement, some of the children, in separation from their loved ones, recite verses of parting, while others, in despair of home and country, moan like the sick and wander bewildered in the wilderness of perplexity. Through the deserts of regret we seek Thy mercy, that perchance the breeze of Thy compassion might blow and Thy ancient favor might arrive. Thine is the praise for the excellence of Thy tribulation, the abundance of Thy favors, and the manifestation of Thy trials, for verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, and we are all them that beseech Thy grace.\n\n=== END BH00951 ===\n\n=== START BH00952 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, Who is none other than Him, and He is God and hath been mighty over all things!\n\nO people of Ha!

Upon you be the peace of God, His grace, His bounty and His gifts! Thou art ever mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, nay rather thou art ever in His presence and art illumined by the splendors of the Sun of loving-kindness. The sorrows that have befallen are known and evident to you, yet worldly events leave no trace upon the tablet of the heart. We are occupied with God and are engaged in His praise and utterance. These two days are not worthy of attention. Praise be to God, most of the transgressors have been and are being recognized. All who possess hearing, sight and heart bear witness to their lies and calumnies. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make you a door for the entrance of those who enter, and a key wherewith the hearts of those who turn to Him may be unlocked, to assist you with the hosts of utterance at all times, and to exalt you through His Name amongst all religions. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower. Peace and glory and splendor be upon you and upon your son and upon those who love you and hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the One, the All-Informed.\n\nIn these days it hath become clear and evident what manner of calumnies were spread in the past. The one who reported the existence of the Qa'im was a woman. When they asked the revered Ja'far whether the honored 'Askari had any male offspring, that wronged one refused and said that there had been a child two years before who had died. Those with ulterior motives rejected and cursed him and called him a liar, but the word of that lying woman, since it accorded with the desires and base interests of heedless souls, they accepted and proclaimed. In brief, the servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His servants from the calumnies, conjectures and imaginings of the people, and to either assist the heedless to return unto Him or to seize them with a compelling force from His presence. Verily He is the Commander, the All-Wise.\n\nThe spiritual friend His Holiness Haji Niyaz, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, came and attained the presence repeatedly, and hosted feasts repeatedly, and all was accepted with honor. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, will through his presence make the heedless aware and guide the seekers. He was repeatedly the recipient of kindness and favor. Blessed and congratulations be unto him.\n\nAs for the matter of the honored beloved His Holiness Haji Ha Qabla S, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, right was with him. Before his mention and news, emphasis was given to His Holiness Ism-i-Jud, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, to write to my beloved His Holiness Nazir, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, that the mention \\[writing\\] and mention of His Holiness Haji at the Threshold is in no way permissible. However, protection has been and is in the grasp of divine power. He will protect them and there has been ordained for them that which is the cause of exaltation and ascendancy. It is hoped they will, with utmost joy and expansion and steadfastness, hold fast to that which God has willed, that there may appear from him that which shall endure with the endurance of names and attributes. May his honor beseech God to enable all to achieve that which is the cause of the exaltation of His Word.\n\nFrom all directions complaints have come about Muhammad-'Ali. From every direction money has come to him and out of pure greed and avarice he has wrongfully appropriated people's property and denied their rights. He and his companion have no equal in the world. It was not imagined such souls would appear in the world, but what was decreed was decreed. A person who considers himself a well-wisher of the world and counts himself a patriot, for a few dirhams has written that which he himself knows to be false, thinking these matters are harmful to the Cause. Nay, by the Self of God! Karim-i-Kirmani has written a book of refutation every year regarding the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, and likewise other divines of Iran have been and are engaged in cursing and execration from pulpits, and Mirza-yi-Sipihr has written in his history regarding His Holiness that which has caused all things to lament. In any case, I beseech God to aid His servants to truthfulness, sincerity, trustworthiness, religious devotion and faithfulness. Verily He has power over all things.\n\nTo the Star risen from the horizon of His Holiness the Afnan, His Honor Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be Baha'u'llah's Most Glorious Glory, I convey greetings and praise, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on his behalf for that which befits His generosity and bestowal. And likewise I send greetings to other friends in that land. All are mentioned in the presence and are recipients of favor. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and those who love you and hear your word.\n\nThe Servant\n\n21 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1307\n\n=== END BH00953 ===\n\n=== START BH00954 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise, sanctified from the world and the mention of nations, befitteth the Possessor of the Kingdom of eternity and the Creator of earth and heaven, Who through His absolute Will created the heaven and made manifest the earth. From these two the clouds appeared, and from them the rains descended, and from the rains the ocean became manifest, and from it the waves came into being. This is the station of the visible ocean; but as for the ocean of utterance, it hath appeared from the rain of the clouds of truth. Through the movement of the Will, resplendent waves arose, and these waves in one station are His manifestations of Names and attributes that have encompassed the world. Glorified be the Creator, glorified be the Educator, glorified be the Maker, glorified be the Bestower! And peace and blessings be upon the Most Great Ocean and the Lord of the world and the Goal of nations. He is the ocean of divine knowledge and its waves, and the signs and mysteries of names and attributes. The pearls of this ocean are sanctified beyond counting and exalted above all limitations. Through Him were spread the signs of knowledge and the mysteries of arts. And upon His family and companions, through whom tongues have testified to God's oneness, power, might, grandeur and sovereignty, and through whom the luminary of justice shone forth among the servants and the sun of grace dawned upon all lands - an everlasting and eternal peace.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived. This servant, thinking it was paper bearing inscriptions, upon touching it found it to be water in spirituality and delicacy - the properties of water were manifest from it. It quenched the thirst of separation and illumined the darkness of remoteness with the light of nearness. A hundred thousand praises upon the intermediaries between us, the interpreters between us, namely the pen and the ink. After attention, consideration and observation, proceeding to the station, it was presented before the countenance of the Lord - His utterance, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him:\n\nPraise be to God, it arrived without delay, hindrance or pause, giving glad tidings of humility, submissiveness, certitude and assurance. The fragrance of love is diffused at all times and the call of the heart is raised in all moments. Praise be to God, the feast of hearing is present if the people of possibility would accept it, and the feast of sight is manifest if they would attain true vision. We beseech and supplicate God that perchance His all-encompassing grace and manifest bounty may preserve the people of unity from the oppression and transgressions of the polytheists. The city of Egypt, which is now your residence, has been the seat of unity and in every age has appeared adorned with a new ornament and resplendent with the lights of arts and sciences. Now its tranquility has been transformed to agitation and its light to darkness. The polytheists have surrounded it while the unitarians are asleep and heedless of the cause and reason. We must all beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which is the cause of the deliverance of His party. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Peace be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have testified to that which God hath testified: that there is no God but Him.\n\nThe Kawthar is flowing, the fragrance of Tasnim is diffusing. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, has been and will be, God willing, all-encompassing. If there has been or will be some delay in sending supplications, the abundance of occupations and assurance are the only causes for delay. That beloved one himself is witness, and God behind him is witness.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the establishment of a primary school and that which raises the stations of man, after it was presented before Him, He said: \"Excellent is what they have undertaken.\" In the realms of knowledge and wisdom, the advancement of the world, and the refinement and tranquility of nations, the education of children holds the foremost rank. Blessed is the one who has arisen to educate children for the sake of God. Time and again, in the past and present, We have counseled the friends of God and commanded them to this firm decree. We beseech God to assist His friends in that which He loves and is pleased with.\n\nIndeed, this matter is of utmost importance, as the foundation of comfort and tranquility depends upon knowledge. Assuredly, God, exalted be His glory, will aid and assist those who act upon this, for He has power over all things. I convey greetings to all the friends in that land. In the nights and days, I beseech God that He may bestow blessings from the clouds of mercy and the heaven of generosity, and likewise grant fellowship and unity, for most of the world's affairs have depended and depend upon these two. Regarding the teaching of different languages, they should consider the opinion of the people of that land. Most in that country display complete animosity and hatred toward the English; let it not be that this matter causes any unseemly word to be spoken regarding the friends. Surely those beloved ones have considered and continue to consider the foundation of matters.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning Aqa 'Abdu'r-Rahim, upon him be God's peace, after it was presented, He smiled and said: \"God willing, may divine invisible assistance encompass all and confirm them in what is befitting. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.\"\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the honored friend Haji 'Abdu'l-Karim, upon him be God's peace and favor, who sent four bags of Sadri rice - they arrived some time ago. Indeed, he is among those who are foremost in good deeds. Praise be to God, all have attained to that which has no equal. The stations of souls that are assured, content and pleasing to God - their manifestation is among the sealed matters with God. Repeatedly has this blessed word been heard: \"Verily God does not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.\" Peace, remembrance, and praise be upon you and upon God's friends there and upon God's righteous servants.\n\nRenewed news arrived today that Aqa 'Abdu'r-Rahim has written to his relatives and mentioned his affairs. According to his writing, he preferred what he received in 'Akka to what was mentioned in that land. Regarding this, He said: \"Let 'Abdu'r-Rahim consider the balance of his affairs. If this land appears preferable to him, let him come, and if he finds that place better, let him stay.\" The purpose is that in either of these two cities, evident prosperity is apparent for him; let him choose.\n\n=== END BH00954 ===\n\n=== START BH00955 ===\n\nPraise and glory befitteth the loved ones of the Lord of all creation who, amidst the clamor of the divines and the croaking of the jurisprudents in the world of existence, acknowledged the supreme Pen and bore witness to all that hath flowed therefrom. These are they whom neither the doubts of men nor the tyranny and oppression of the dwellers of the earth could debar from the Lord of creation or deprive of the bounties of the Day of Return. They rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings through the Name of the Lord of all beings, and arose to serve the Cause with such arising as hath amazed the Concourse on high. Exalted be their stations, glorious their condition, and magnificent their steadfastness.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the oceans of wisdom and utterance have surged in the realm of creation, and through Whose most sweet call the followers of all religions have been attracted!

I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and King of the seen and unseen, to send down upon Thy Afnan, who hath been attracted by Thy verses and enkindled with the fire of Thy love and hath sought Thy presence once again, through Thy bounty and favors, the rain-showers from the heaven of Thy grace and whatsoever beseemeth Thy greatness and power and generosity and gifts. O my Lord! Thou seest him turning unto Thee, uttering Thy praise and arising to serve Thee. Aid him through Thy bounty and power, then assist him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the All-Merciful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.\n\nMy soul be a sacrifice unto your service and your steadfastness! Your blessed letter was received - such a receiving that each of the ear, eye and heart took its share, for it was adorned with the praise and glorification of Him Who is the Goal of your desire and my desire and the desire of all who are in earth and heaven. After its reading, recital and perusal, I turned my face toward the lights of His countenance and presented it before the Divine Throne. This is what the Desired One hath revealed in reply. His blessed and exalted Word: O Afnan, O Muhammad! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness. Thy cries, lamentations and anguished pleas in separation and remoteness have been heard. Thou hast ever been before Our gaze, and thy purpose, deeds and intention are clear and evident before Our countenance. The days of attainment and presence before the Wronged One are remembered. Praise be to God, the Dawning-Place of generosity and bounty hath bestowed a favor whose mention the pens of the world are powerless and incapable to describe. Every possessor of sight and hearing beareth witness to this most exalted Word that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. The smoke of tyranny and oppression hath encompassed the world, preventing those who seek from reaching their Ultimate Goal, their Utmost Purpose and their Supreme Summit, and depriving sight and hearing from beholding and hearkening unto that for which they were created. Yet they are heedless that nothing among all created things can prevent or hinder the people of God. Their hearts have found their way to the Most Great Ocean and their eyes are enabled to witness the Most Exalted Horizon. These are the chosen ones mentioned and recorded by the Supreme Pen in the books of the past and future. O Afnan! Be not saddened by thy engagement in outward affairs, for God, exalted be His glory, hath ordained that your occupation is worship itself - this is a decree revealed in the Book aforetime. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee that which will gladden thy heart and solace thine eyes, and grant thee the good of this world and the world to come. There is none other God but He, the Ordainer, the Great. Upon thee be glory from the presence of the Ancient Revealer.\n\nThis evanescent servant hath beseeched and continueth to beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, that we may once again gather beneath the shade of the divine Lote-Tree of His loving-kindness. Whenever this servant beholdeth the Mazra'ih where the Throne was established, he remembereth the days of attainment to His presence. In truth, love is a wondrous essence - its will floweth more freely than the will of all who dwell on earth, and its influence is more potent than the authority of kings. Its effects are manifest and its power evident. Great is He Who created it and through it made firm the connection of the world. I beseech God, my Lord and my Goal and the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven, to extend to your honor a blessing from His presence and draw you near unto Him once again. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nConcerning what was written about the Semnan business, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. These are the words uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: \"If settlement can be reached with spirit and fragrance, it would be well; otherwise, proceed according to what the Afnan, upon him be My Baha, deemeth advisable and make firm the partnership document. The command is in God's hands - He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth what He desireth, and He is the Commander, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant beseecheth and hopeth that the True One, exalted be His glory, may grant confirmation and success in all matters. Through His loving-kindness, a drop becometh an ocean and an atom transformeth into a sun.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the honored beloved, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm him, grant him determination, and cause his occupation to culminate in the printing of the Words of God. If, God willing, he attains to this station, he will have attained to every good. We beseech Him for confirmation in all conditions. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. That is, in this occupation and work in which they are engaged, I offer them greetings, praise, glory and splendor, and in all conditions I beseech for them whatsoever is conducive to loftiness, exaltation, and the perpetuation of name and remembrance. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bestower, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.\n\n=== END BH00955 ===\n\n=== START BH00956 ===\n\nHe is God! It is not permissible for a lover to show forth claims of existence and self in the presence of the Beloved. If he should take one step beyond this path, he would no longer be counted among the lovers. Never doth true love accept a living soul, nor doth the hawk take a dead mouse as prey.\n\nYea, some lovers have recounted their tribulations and hardships in the presence of the Beloved of all possibility, and their purpose was communion with the Beloved and attention to the Lord of their goal, not the mention of self and desire. Now a messenger has come down from the most exalted goals of glory's purpose and speaks certain words - understand who speaks and what is spoken. By God! If ye but knew and were informed of the mysteries of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, that lie behind the veil of grandeur, ye would sacrifice yourselves out of love for God, the Lord of all names. The aforementioned messenger related a tale that once when We were at the Mount of Splendor, and the Beloved of all horizons went forth intending to reach the Mount of Glory, He implored with utmost humility those who claimed to love Him, saying that though this journey and migration might outwardly seem easy and simple, yet inwardly it was severe and a gate of tests, and though it appeared to be with sovereignty and power, in reality it concealed countless trials and distresses. \"Do not present yourselves and cause yourselves hardship - let Me migrate alone.\" All the loving and compassionate words He spoke, both indirect and direct, proved ineffective. This servant and a group, claiming we desired no provision save His good-pleasure and had no purpose save His countenance, in our own estimation remained steadfast but heedless of the sincere counsel and certainty of the Friend. We resolved to journey and became fellow travelers with the Beloved's presence. After traversing some distance in the wilderness, the fire of love became extinguished and beauty's attraction became veiled. When we passed beyond that station, we counted good deeds as evil and evil deeds as good, until we arrived at the Green Isle. There the divine ark settled upon the mount of the Cause. Thereafter we traveled morning and evening upon the steeds of desire through the desert of suspicions and fancies - sometimes gathered, sometimes scattered, sometimes in love, sometimes in heedlessness we passed our days and nights. The Salsabil of utterance constantly flowed from the Merciful One's lips, yet thirst was absent; the lights of His countenance shone from the horizon of glory, yet attraction was not found. Each day we increased in fancy and conjecture while decreasing in attention to truth. And with these displeasing conditions and unseemly attributes, we became so immersed in the depths of heedlessness and desire that we grew unmindful even of our own state. Through all conditions we observed the Beloved's countenance showing complete kindness and gentleness. Some of us wondered how, if divine all-encompassing knowledge exists, we could be accepted despite these reprehensible deeds. Finally we considered the Truth heedless and ourselves wise and knowing, unaware that the Most Great Mercy prevents the tearing of veils. If we rendered any service, we followed it with obligation and injury. After that land He intended to migrate and again forbade all from accompanying Him. We neither perceived nor awakened to what was the cause of the prohibition and why. Once again we migrated and traversed wildernesses with the Lord of the goal until we arrived in another land and settled with the Friend in one place, secretly.\n\nO soul! We have become preoccupied until the fire of desire gained ascendancy and we were barred from the Most Glorious Horizon. Through the abundance of meetings, we lost sight of the value of attainment, and the veil of shame was rent asunder. Now we have imprisoned the Beloved in a place and at all times, to the extent of our ability and power, we spare Him not from the arrows of suspicion and the spears of fancy, for we have found Him imprisoned, incarcerated and solitary. Heedlessness has reached such a state that in that blessed place, to which all the Concourse on High turn their gaze and from which they seek assistance, we openly utter the most abhorrent words and engage in the most misguided and base deeds. Woe unto us! The words of God have not affected us, and yet we have not awakened. If we could not be faithful, at least let us not be unfaithful. Not a night do we spend in remembrance, nor in contemplation.\n\nIt is related that Fu?ayl of Khurasan was among the most wicked of men and a highwayman. He fell in love with a maiden and one night went to her, climbing over a wall. Then he heard someone reciting this verse: \"Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to submit to the remembrance of God?\" It affected his heart and he said: \"Yes, my Lord, the time has indeed come!\" He turned back, repented, and made his way to the Sacred House where he dwelt for thirty years until his spirit ascended to the supreme horizon. It is strange that hearing the Word of God from the tongue of one of His servants had such an effect that in an instant he returned from the lowest depths of existence to the horizon of the All-Merciful, while these servants have repeatedly and continuously heard the melodies of the All-Merciful Spirit from the tongue of power and majesty, yet they have not been affected enough to become aware even of the repugnance of their deeds, actions, suspicions and idle fancies.\n\nWhen the narrative reached this point, the heaven of utterance was thunderstruck upon the mount of speech, and the pen fell unconscious, severed from expression. \"Naught shall befall us save what God hath prescribed for us.\" We beseech God to open our eyes and make us aware of ourselves and our deeds. If we are not enabled to know His exalted Self, may we at least be enabled to know our heedless selves, and may He remove from our faces the veils that prevent us from beholding Him rising from the horizon of grace and bounty, that we may detach ourselves from all who dwell in the realms of creation and turn wholly toward Him, for He is our All-Merciful Lord. We beseech Him to enable us to turn to Him in repentance morning and evening, and to protect the Dawning-Place of His countenance's lights from the spears of His loved ones, for He seeks no helper other than Himself, and He is their source and their ultimate end, and He declares: \"There is no God but God.\"\n\n=== END BH00956 ===\n\n=== START BH00957 ===\n\nHe is the Dawning Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!\n\nThis is a Book from the All-Merciful to him whose name was mentioned before the Wronged One in this Prison, which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of Names and the Most Great Prison in the Crimson Tablet from the Supreme Pen, of which none hath been apprised save God, the Lord of the mighty throne, that the Call may attract him to the supreme heights and make him soar on the wings of certitude in this atmosphere from whose rushing winds is heard \"The Kingdom is God's, Lord of all worlds.\"\n\nThe loved ones and chosen ones of God made mention of thee. We make mention of thee with that which no mention in the world nor what the nations possess can equal. To this testifieth every just and discerning one. Blessed is he who hath attained to beholding the pearls of wisdom and utterance which We have brought forth from the treasuries of My Supreme Pen before the faces of men while We were in the hands of the oppressors. The Wronged One desireth from thee and from others naught save justice and fairness concerning this Most Great Announcement whereby the limbs of all names have trembled, the idols of vain imaginings have been shattered, and earthquakes have seized the tribes of the earth, save whom God, thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, willeth.\n\nWe beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee to return unto His traces and whatsoever hath appeared from Him. Verily He guideth thee and all upon earth to His straight path. Blessed is the strong one who hath purified his heart with the Kawthar flowing from the spring of My Pen and hath taken the chalice of immortality from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and hath drunk before all faces in spite of those who have denied God's proof and His evidence, who have disputed His signs and disbelieved in the blessing of His knowledge which was sent down from the heaven of His mercy that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nCanst thou deliver the Youth of the Cause from the pit of vain fancies and arise among the people with such steadfastness as shall not be shaken by the doubts of them that have denied the Day of Judgment? Hearken unto My call, then raise thy right hand in the name of thy Lord, the King of the Kingdom of Names, and rend therewith the veils that have come between truth and creation and the coverings that have prevented the servants from turning unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nHear the call of the Wronged One. Verily He mentioneth thee for the sake of God and remindeth thee of His signs and teacheth thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all His worlds. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Generous. When thou hast drunk the wine of revelation from the hand of God's bounty and the breezes of inspiration have seized thee in His days, say:\n\nMy God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy confirmation to turn unto Thy horizon, to hearken to the scratching of Thy Pen and to witness Thy signs. I beseech Thee by Thy fire whereby Thou didst guide them that drew nigh unto the Sinai of Thy knowledge and gave them to drink the Kawthar of proof from the hand of Thy bounty, and by the mysteries of the ocean of Thy wisdom and the pearls of the sea of Thy knowledge, that Thou wilt aid Thy servants to be fair in Thy Cause, that they may hear the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree with their ears and behold its fruits with their eyes. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I bear witness that Thou didst mention me when I was silent in Thy remembrance and called me when I was heedless of Thy manifestation, Thy dawning and Thy proof. I beseech Thee by the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom and the waves of the ocean of Thy grace to make me purified from what the people possess and adorned with the ornament of justice and fairness. O Lord! Have mercy upon me through Thy bounty and Thy mercy and aid me to be steadfast in Thy remembrance and praise. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nHear thou in the Persian tongue the Call of the Wronged One. In the past, We made mention of all and counselled justice and fairness. This is the Day wherein the Primal Point, in the Most Exalted Paradise, uttereth the blessed words \"Verily, I am the first of them that worship.\" This Revelation encompasseth all things and is not encompassed by them. None hath attained to its true understanding as befitteth its station. Behold, then recall what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Bayan, where He saith: \"I have written a gem concerning His remembrance: He cannot be indicated by My indication, nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan.\" Were there to be found justice even less than a tiny particle, this one passage would suffice the world. Today the Proof raiseth its call, and the very essence of evidence summoneth all creation to the Lord of all beings. The Cause shineth as the sun at its zenith. Beseech thou God to grant strength to the eyes of the heedless and cleanse them from rheum, that they may see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears. Today the waves of the ocean of utterance surge before all faces, and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth shine forth resplendent. Is it fitting that man should deprive himself of the outpourings of the True Bestower through the idle fancies of men? Nay, by His very Self, the True One! Today all must see with the eye of God and hear with His ear. Light and darkness are distinguished one from the other. We beseech God in all conditions to confirm thee and seek His aid that thou mayest, through celestial power, wisdom, and utterance, awaken the heedless servants and grant them sight. He is the Confirmer, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious.\n\nFor the sake of God, meditate for a moment upon the former party and the recompense of their deeds. What was their claim, and what became their reward on the Day of Retribution? The party that counted themselves the most learned and the most ascetic and God-fearing among all the peoples of the world pronounced, in the early years, such a verdict against the Truth Itself as no other party among all the parties of the world had pronounced. This matter hath been mentioned repeatedly, and if one were to reflect, he would surely pass beyond his own understanding and that of the people, turn unto what is with God, and attain unto that for which he was created. Today the Call is raised from all directions, and the Speaker of the Mount is seated upon the throne of Revelation. His proof hath encompassed the world and His evidence all creation. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of utterance and heard that which the Tongue of God, the True, the Trustworthy, hath spoken. This Wronged One hath spoken for the sake of God, and We hope that thou too wilt hearken and ponder for His sake. If thou observest with fairness what hath been revealed from the beginning until now in the Holy Writings, thou wouldst testify that whatsoever hath appeared hath been from the Wronged One from the beginning until now. We beseech God to aid thee in that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily, He is the Lord of creation. There is no God but Him, the Explainer, the All-Knowing.\n\n=== END BH00957 ===\n\n=== START BH00958 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty!\n\nFrom time immemorial the divine fragrances have wafted from the paradise of God's loving-kindness, and unto time everlasting shall the spiritual breezes blow from the right hand of the celestial Throne. The clouds of bounty and generosity have never ceased to shower their exalted bestowals, nor has the rain-laden cloud of grace and mercy ever paused in its outpouring of heavenly favors. Praised be God that the sun of loving-kindness is shining bright and the moon of generosity is rising from the horizon of glory. Yet souls that are preoccupied and confined beings remain deprived of this primal mercy and eternal blessing, and shall continue to be veiled and excluded by the veils of fancy and the shrouds of idle imagination.\n\nIt is evident to your honour that the purpose of creation hath ever been and shall remain the recognition of God and attainment unto His presence. This most exalted aim and sublime goal hath been clearly set forth in all divine Books and hallowed Scriptures without any veil. Whosoever hath been enabled to attain unto that Dayspring of guidance and Dawn of Oneness hath attained unto nearness and reunion, which is the essence of Paradise and the highest of all heavens, and hath entered the realm of \"the space of two bow-lengths\" that lieth beyond the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary. Otherwise, such a soul dwelleth and shall continue to dwell in the abodes of remoteness, which are the very essence of hellfire and the reality of negation, though outwardly he may be seated upon lofty thrones and exalted seats. Verily, that heaven of truth is able and empowered to guide all men from the left hand of remoteness and desire to the right hand of nearness and reunion. \"Had God willed He would have made all mankind one people.\" However, the purpose is the ascent of pure souls and detached essences who, by their primordial nature, attain unto the shore of the Most Great Ocean, that the seekers of the Beauty of the All-Glorious may be distinguished and separated from those who dwell in the habitations of error and misguidance. Thus hath the matter been ordained by the Pen of transcendent glory.\n\nWe hope, God willing, that your honour will not deprive himself of the wine of divine mercy, nor sully pure vision with transient means, that he may pass from the vanishing mirage to the eternal ocean. Likewise, the reason for the non-appearance of the Manifestations of justice and Daysprings of grace with outward power and earthly dominion hath been these very conditions of distinction and differentiation. For were that Ancient Beauty to appear and manifest Himself as He truly is, none would have the power to deny or turn away. Rather, all created things would be thunderstruck by beholding His lights, nay utterly annihilated. In such case, those who turn towards God would not be distinguished from those who turn away from Him. This matter hath been evident in all previous Manifestations, as hath reached your hearing. This is why in every fresh Revelation and exalted Manifestation, when the polytheists beheld that eternal Beauty and peerless Countenance in the guise of ordinary mortals like other people, they became veiled and heedless, and drew not nigh unto that Tree of nearness. Rather, they arose to oppose and uproot those who turned towards God, as hath been witnessed in this Dispensation. These ignorant ones have imagined that through killing, plundering, and banishing God's loved ones from their lands, they can extinguish the lamp of divine power and deprive the Sun of eternity of its light. They are heedless that all these tribulations are as oil to fuel this Lamp. Thus doth God change what He pleaseth, and He, verily, hath power over all things.\n\nIndeed, through the migration of these emigrants to this land, the fame and exaltation of this Cause hath encompassed all regions of earth, such that all the peoples of these parts have become aware. This victory hath been achieved by the King of Oneness through the hand of the enemies themselves, without anyone being conscious or aware of it. This is the meaning of that Persian verse which sayeth: \"Even or odd, Thou wilt win the wager.\" In all cases, sovereignty and \\[...\\] Behold the power and ascendancy of the true Sovereign, and purify and sanctify thine ears from the words of the Manifestations of negation and the Daysprings of wrath. Ere long thou shalt witness the truth encompassing all things and prevailing over all else, and shalt observe all else to be nonexistent and utter nothingness. Though, praise be to God, the Truth and His Manifestations have ever abode in the heights of transcendent glory and the summit of inaccessible grandeur - nay, all loftiness and sublimity were created through His Word, could ye but perceive with this Youth's vision. Furthermore, this servant hath ever been engaged in remembrance of that friend, and the precedence of thy friendship hath never been forgotten, nor shall it ever be forgotten, God willing, subject to certain conditions, of which I am one. We hope that this remembrance shall not be cut off by forgetfulness, nor this affirmation be followed by obliteration. We cherish the hope from the Lord of Glory that despite utmost physical remoteness thou mayest attain the heights of spiritual nearness, such that all who dwell on earth may not become a veil between thee and the Object of thy desire. For besides this nearness and remoteness mentioned, there is a nearness with God that hath no likeness, opposite, or equal in the realm of limitations and physical places. Strive thou that through the favors of the King of Oneness thou mayest enter into that station, that thou mayest be wholly purified and sanctified from the tree of remoteness with all its fruits and leaves. This is a nearness that will never be transformed into remoteness and will endure through the eternity of God. And God guideth whom He willeth unto a straight path. That which this servant desireth from thee, for God, in God, and through God, is this: that his honor Haji Mirza Ahmad - may God cause him to enter beneath the shadow of His favor - who hath emigrated with this servant and accompanied him on this supreme journey, and who hath endured the utmost hardship, should be assisted by thee with the fullest measure of effort and care in his affairs. The wealth of his honor Haji that remaineth from the plunder of the idolaters is only that which remaineth in thy care. God willing, thou shouldst ensure it reaches him, and whatsoever lieth within thy power regarding his affairs, thou shouldst not delay, for it shall not be lost in the sight of God.\n\n=== END BH00958 ===\n\n=== START BH00959 ===\n\nO Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God!\n\nHe is the Expounder, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise\n\nYour letters have each attained unto the presence of the Wronged One, and from every letter thereof wafts the fragrance of devotion, sincerity and steadfastness. Regarding what you mentioned about the printing of the Book, this matter is contingent upon consultation. In these days, wisdom dictates against printing, for should the sacred revealed Books proliferate in that city, it would surely provoke an outcry from the ignorant of the earth. Though beneficial for those possessed of true vision and spiritual hearing, such souls are few in number in any city, while most would rise up crying \"O the religion!\" without thought or consideration of consequences. Previously, Habibullah, upon him be My glory, intended to print a few limited copies and permission was granted, but only on condition that it not exceed bounds or open the gates of tumult. For nearly twenty years the Book of Certitude was printed without verification, yet until last year there was hesitation in sending it abroad, for the opposers and deniers await any pretext to create mischief and kindle the fire of sedition. In all matters one must be guided by wisdom. You have twice attained the Most Holy Court and stayed for some time, observing the conduct and behavior from all aspects. Were one to reflect upon the manners and conduct of the Truth, he would utter the blessed words \"Verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" From the days when the Light of Truth shone forth from the horizon of Iraq until now, the reins of affairs have been in the grasp of God's power, and commands and ordinances have issued forth according to the requirements of wisdom. For this reason the cities of Iran remain tranquil and the mischief-makers restrained. Had there been the slightest delay in what was manifested, the fire of corruption would have appeared from every land. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect you and His loved ones from the evil of His enemies, and to assist you and them in the wisdom that God has made a fortress for His loved ones and a shield for His party. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about Sheikh Nabil and likewise concerning the acceptance \\[of unity\\] and his eagerness, therefore purely out of grace a special Tablet has been sent down for him from the heaven of bounty. Give it to him that he may drink therefrom what will make him arise to serve the Cause, speak in remembrance and praise, and stand firm in what God, the Lord of the worlds, has willed. They mentioned the brothers and loved ones of that land - convey to all of them on behalf of the Wronged One a greeting and salutation whose light shall illumine the realm of hearts and minds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make their names among the Names, their remembrances among the Remembrances, and to make them standards of His mention amongst His servants. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about the Leaf, this matter should proceed with spirit and fragrance, meaning with the consent of the mother of the Leaf if they have intended and truly desire to proceed. Thus has shone forth the sun of permission from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's will, the Commander, the All-Wise.\n\nSome souls from the surrounding regions have been honored with the light of permission. If some of those souls accompany, it is especially acceptable for service. And from the people of Najafabad also a few are permitted - those souls are good for service. God willing, may all attain to that which leads to the reaching and attainment of the ultimate goal and the supreme height.\n\nAs to the expenditure of one hundred tumans, if possible let some give it, and after the arrival of the Trustee in this land, We shall instruct him to return it to its owners. Until then they are on their way, and in these days they shall attain to that which hath been the hope of them that are nigh and sincere. Should anything beyond the specified amount be needed, there is no harm. If funds had been available in those lands beyond what was mentioned, more would have been bestowed. In any case, God's guiding hands will manifest and execute whatsoever is needed. He, verily, is the All-Wise Ordainer.\n\nAs to what they have mentioned regarding certain souls and that which proceeded from their lips, this is undoubtedly true. Consider the days of the Seal of the Prophets: after His turning to Yathrib and the gathering of the Ansar and people from surrounding areas, each day brought fresh injury and new occurrences. In particular, one of the Ansar who was outwardly adorned with the mantle of faith and decorated with the crown of confession became tainted with theft. After it was brought to His attention, it is known what befell that Holy Being, and in view of the multitude of enemies and their gloating, He tarried in wisdom until He was addressed with the words \"and be not an advocate for those who betray their trust.\"\n\nAgain the greed and avarice of Muhammad-'Ali in the Great City blazed forth and the hidden contents of his breast were revealed, despite having received the utmost outward kindness and having attained apparent prestige and considerable wealth. Suddenly he appeared with complete arrogance, consorting and associating with enemies of every kind. Greed set his very foundations ablaze, and passion made its home in his heart. We beseech God to protect us from the evil of his teacher. He committed that which no heedless one had done, his betrayal regarding people's property becoming evident and manifest. We beseech God to aid him to repent and return, and to make him aware of his deeds and how he fell short in regard to God's justice and bounty.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me amidst the enemies of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath subdued the world, and by the light of Thy knowledge whereby Thou hast illumined the hearts of the nations, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom, to assist Thy loved ones to act with justice. Thou art He to Whose power all things possible have testified, and to Whose grandeur all created things have borne witness. There is no God but Thee, the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nMake mention of the friends of that land on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist them to perform deeds whereby the station of deeds will be exalted, and to utter words whereby the hearts of men will be attracted, and to show such trustworthiness as will cause the limbs of the treacherous among the people of error to tremble, and to manifest such chastity as will raise the banner of God's protection throughout all lands, and to shine with such light as will guide people to the court of nearness and holiness and glory and beauty. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Munificent.\n\n=== END BH00959 ===\n\n=== START BH00960 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One God\n\nO thou who bearest My Name! Upon thee be my glory! I pray that thou mayest be blessed with divine grace. The letter from the Afnan, upon him be My glory and mercy, which was sent from the land of Shin, was received. May they ever be engaged in the remembrance of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, detached from the world and all who dwell therein. That which thou hast arranged concerning he who beareth the name of Jamal, upon him be My glory, is acceptable. Indeed, they have inhaled the fragrances of the divine days, of which all are heedless today, and are gazing toward and turning to the highest horizon. This is among God's greatest bounties, that He hath enabled them in such days to recognize that which all others are veiled from.\n\nO Mahdi! The world is in upheaval while the people remain heedless. The dust of the deeds and words of the veiled ones hath obscured the luminous morn. Today every firm and mighty foundation is shaken, and every steadfast and upright foot hath faltered, save those whom thy Lord hath willed. The world's convulsions increase daily, yet its people perceive not the cause and reason, and remain veiled from what is with God by what is with themselves. The Sun of Truth is shining, the ocean is surging, the scratching of the Pen is raised, the Tree is speaking, and the Nightingale is warbling - yet deaf ears and blind eyes are witnessed. Most of what was revealed by the Supreme Pen in sacred texts and tablets hath come to pass, as thou hast witnessed, and what remaineth suspended in the heaven of God's Will shall assuredly be made manifest. Woe unto the heedless when the Great Terror comes!\n\nO thou who bearest My Name! The Cause is exceedingly great. In one of the tablets revealed in these days, this most exalted Word was sent down: \"The brocade of the Book of Creation was adorned with the word 'He'. We removed it with complete power and placed 'I'. By God's life, this is a mighty matter which none can bear save he who is the most powerful in the world and holdeth fast to the Most Great Name.\" The Hand of Complete Power hath rent asunder the veils of creation to a known measure. Now it is observed that the dawning-places of vain imaginings and the sources of idle fancies are veiled by other veils. Reflect upon the baseness of nature and paucity of understanding of the veiled ones, who have but newly returned to their original station. By the Sun of Grace which shineth from the horizon of the Prison, they are considered before God as more veiled than all other peoples. All divine Books testify to the greatness of this Day, yet the people of the Book remain unaware and heedless. Thou hast witnessed how that rebellious and transgressing sect who counted themselves the saved and blessed community \\[behaved\\]. Wait, and thou shalt see the others more rebellious and wretched than all the peoples of the earth. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. Say: He hath come with the truth and cannot be indicated by the signs of all the Books, nor doth He walk in the ways of the people of creation. He hath appeared and made manifest His Straight Path.\n\nO thou who bearest My Name! Ja'far spoke one word in truth and sincerity - for nearly one thousand three hundred years they called him a liar, and the fruit of the deeds and words of that rebellious band was that they martyred God's loved ones, who had no peer or like on earth, with the most grievous torments. And now the veiled ones of the Bayan manifest exactly the same words and deeds, as if they had no knowledge of the Day of God and had not caught the fragrance of the garment of His Manifestation. From the ocean of knowledge they remain deprived.\n\nO Mahdi, arise for God's sake and speak for God's sake and exert your utmost effort in God's path. Perchance through the Name of Truth and the Power of Truth, exalted be His glory, you may purify and sanctify the new creation from the doubts, veils and insinuations of this atheistic group. A word that is spoken for God's sake contains within it the nature and effect of milk whose taste has not changed, and it will raise the children of the age to the lofty station of maturity and give them to drink from the ocean of knowledge. Likewise in these days, in one of the Tablets this exalted word was sent down from the divine Kingdom of utterance: Until you do not become aware of the falsehood of the past, you will not bear witness to the truth of this Day. This blessed word has been and is one of the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge. Blessed are they that understand. Whosoever attains to this testimony is mentioned before God as among the mightiest of creation. This is why the Point (the Bab), may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, declares that a one-year-old seed of the Day of His manifestation is mightier than all the Bayan. O My Name! The breezes of torment for the deceivers from all parties have encompassed them, but now they are unaware and heedless. Reflect upon Alexander of this age who was entitled the Emperor of the world. The hand of powerful glory lifted up two parties, as was detailed in previous years in the divine Tablets. Blessed are they that observe, blessed are they that perceive, and blessed are they that reflect. Say: This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him. He needeth not any proof to demonstrate His Cause, nor any mention from among mentions. He hath come from the heaven of Command with clear sovereignty. Neither the hosts of the world nor the ranks of nations can frustrate Him. He hath proclaimed before all faces with the most exalted call: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Powerful. By God! My Cause is great, great! But most of the people are heedless. In these days in one of the Tablets this firm and impregnable word was revealed: Today is very great and wondrous, for the He is manifest in the garment of I and the Hidden One speaketh with \"I am the Witnessed One.\" Despite the greatness of this Cause which by the testimony of all the Books is more manifest than the sun in midheaven, no person of insight has been nor will be confused about it, for its lights, manifestations, verses and evidences have encompassed all regions. None denieth it save every remote deceiver. At the end of the Book We make mention of another Afnan and conclude with his remembrance. Verily thy Lord is He Who judgeth as He pleaseth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He came forth turning unto God until he attained the presence of the Face and heard what the Tongue of the Wronged One uttered in this noble station. God willing, may all, men and women, attain unto the fragrances of the divine days, remain firm in His Cause, be turned toward His horizon, and speak His praise. The glory from God, the Lord of the worlds, be upon them.\n\n=== END BH00960 ===\n\n=== START BH00961 ===\n\nHe is God, there is no God but Him!\n\nO servant of God! Upon thee be the Glory of God! We give thee glad tidings at the outset of this utterance that thy works have been accepted before God, the Lord of all worlds. The Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged thy turning, thy presence, and thy standing before the Gate that was opened unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. We give thee yet another glad tiding that thou mayest share it with Nabil-i-\\[Ba\\], upon him be My Glory, that the sun of permission hath dawned from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having answered my prayer! My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy favor, O Thou the Desire of the hearts of all men, past and present!\n\nWe wish to fulfill all thy needs, as beareth witness the Supreme Paradise, the Most Exalted Heaven, and the dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory in this lofty station. However, some matters proceed and others are stayed according to the requirements of God's wisdom, the Mighty, the Powerful. We give thee glad tidings again and again that We love thee and remember thee as We remembered thee before, and We reveal in thy name that which shall not cease to yield its fragrance throughout the eternity of My Kingdom, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nAs for the matter of the sum thou didst mention, thou shouldst refer it to the Nasir, upon him be My Glory. It must reach him, and the Afnan, upon him be My Glory, must deliver it to him. This year, through the calumnies of the calumniators, there befell the Nasir that which caused the greatest sorrow. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants to be truthful, to return and to turn unto the gate of His bounty. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The heedless souls have committed that which hath caused grief to the loved ones of God.\n\nAs for thy desire to visit the Nasir, upon him be My Glory, and thy request for mention - blessed art thou for We have found thee among the faithful in the kingdom of creation. O thou who art present before the Gate! God, exalted be His glory, hath loved and continueth to love faithfulness. It is the ornament of the temples of the sincere ones, the near ones, and the sanctified ones. Whenever thou desirest, present thyself and perform that for which the people of the world have been created. Blessed art thou and blessed is he! This deed was accepted even before its manifestation. When thou seest him, give him My glad tidings, remind him of My verses, and illumine him with the effulgences of the Sun of My loving-kindness. We beseech God to assist him and his son who was named Habib and his other son who was named Asadu'llah in the Book of Names, to that which will exalt the Word of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.\n\nThou didst mention 'Ali-i-Akbar, upon him be My Glory, and didst seek permission to attain his presence, meeting, and circumambulation as his deputy. This matter was illumined with the light of permission even before being mentioned. When thou seest him, stand before him and proclaim \"Allah-u-Akbar\" on My behalf and say: Blessed art thou, O thou who art exiled in the lands for the sake of God, the Lord of creation! In these days there hath been revealed from the heaven of utterance of the Lord of religions that which causeth joy and gladness to the people of the cities of justice and fairness. Whenever thou desirest, act as deputy and representative. Thus hath the decree of permission been sent down from the heaven of God's command, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThou didst mention 'Ali-i-Haydar, upon him be My Glory. We testify that he hath performed in the path of God that which the reckoners are unable to reckon. The love of him is binding upon all the loved ones of God. All must strive to discharge the debt that is due to him.\n\nO my God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant standing among Thy servants by Thy Name which was named 'Ali before Haydar in Thy Most Great Scene, and by another name which was inscribed by Thy Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. O Lord! Strengthen him with Thy sovereignty, then aid him and Thy friends and those who love Thee and are sincere toward Thee. Verily, Thou art the One with power over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs.\n\nWhenever that honored one desires \\[to go\\] on his behalf and attain his presence and meeting, before setting out recite this verse and then proceed:\n\nO my God, my God! Thou knowest and seest that I desire to turn toward Thy most exalted station and visit Thee through him who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Strengthen him with the hosts of Thy utterance and wisdom, then open before his face the doors of Thy riches and bounty. O Lord! Aid Thy loved ones and Thy friends and servants to love him and support him. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent.\n\nO servant of God! Upon thee be My glory! Blessed art thou for what thou hast mentioned, and happy art thou for what thou hast described. We testify that he is among the triumphant ones, and there hath been sent down for him that which the treasures of the world cannot equal. We beseech God to strengthen him and preserve his trusts with Him. Verily, He is the Protector, the Trustworthy.\n\nO 'Ali before Haydar! Upon thee be the ocean of grace and bounty from God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. Thou hast been mentioned in the nights and days before the face of the Lord of all mankind. We beseech God to enable all to do that which He loveth and is pleased with, and through which His Cause, the Guardian over all who are in the heavens and the earth, may be exalted.\n\nAnd We desired to mention Qasim, upon him be My glory! We have mentioned him before and at this time for his having turned toward the Supreme Horizon when mankind turned away from it, save those whom God, the Lord of the worlds, wished.\n\nWe have mentioned Our loved ones in Ba and Dal, and We have counseled and do counsel all with most eloquent utterance to trustworthiness and godliness and that whereby the station of man may be exalted in the contingent world. This Wronged One beareth witness that servants have been brought from nothingness into being for the betterment, fellowship and unity of mankind. Corruption and conflict have ever been and are condemned. The divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures have given the glad-tidings that the purpose of this Most Great Manifestation is none other than the reformation of the world and its peoples, that perchance through the power of utterance military might may be abolished, and the world be governed through the power of love. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of trustworthiness, which is the best ornament for the world. Take hold, O servants of God, of that which ye have been commanded by One Who is the Counselor, the All-Knowing. The glory that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of grace be upon thee, O thou who hast turned with all thy being unto God, the Mighty, the Praised.\n\n=== END BH00961 ===\n\n=== START BH00962 ===\n\nO Kazim, hear the call from 'Akka, for it guides thee to the supreme horizon and ultimate goal, and draws thee nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Thy letter reached the Wronged One, and We heard thy call and have answered thee with this wondrous and glorious Tablet. Beware lest the affairs of the world withhold thee from the Lord of Eternity. Set aside what is with the people and hold fast to that which is with God, Lord of all the worlds. He hath come from the heaven of proof with verses that all the world and whatsoever is therein cannot equal, and with evidences that none save every transgressing sinner would deny. Say: O concourse of the earth! The Lord of Heaven hath appeared with a Cause against which neither the armies of the world can prevail, nor can the might of any distant oppressor frighten Him. Say: Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of the Bayan, and oppose not Him but for Whom the verses would not have been revealed nor the evidences appeared. To this testifieth the Book of God, the Mighty, the Wise, which speaketh amidst the world and summoneth the peoples unto His straight path. Blessed is the servant who hath cast aside what is with the people, hoping for that which is with God, the Lord of this manifest Day. Blessed is the servant who knoweth his station and transgresseth not that which hath been ordained in God's Book, the Mighty, the Great. Verily, He Who hath come from the heaven of grandeur is the Truth, Whom minds are powerless to know and pens to describe in befitting terms. He it is by Whom the Trump was blown, whereupon all in the heavens and earth were struck down, save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willed otherwise. Say: Cast behind you your vain imaginings. By God! The horizon of proof hath been illumined with the light of certitude. Take ye the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him, then act according to what hath been revealed therein and be not of the heedless. Thus have We sent down the verses and manifested the Cause that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.\n\nAt this point We change from the eloquent tongue to the luminous tongue, as a bounty from Us, for We are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The stations of the Manifestations of Revelation and Dawning-places of inspiration are diverse, yet the universal Manifestations have been and are aware of all matters. Past and future exist not in that realm. This verse was witnessed in sleep. Blessed are they who possess understanding and they who reflect. In all things is the sign of God manifest and evident. Were eyes not veiled by the veils of conjecture and fancy and the veils of the heedless, they would attain to that which beseemeth this divine Day. Through the sanctification of these souls is manifested the sanctification of God, glorified be His majesty, and through the unity of these souls is made evident the unity of God. Should anyone make mention of aught else besides what hath been mentioned, he would surely find himself powerless to sanctify the Divine Essence from likeness and similitude. The people of the Furqan have remained deprived of true unity. Were the Supreme Pen to move in this station according to what is intended, clamor would be raised from all directions. Therefore doth it speak with measure and uttereth according to measure. These stations have culminated in this Most Great Revelation. Should anyone reflect upon the previous Books, or observe the Furqan which distinguisheth between truth and falsehood, and attain unto the fragrance of the Bayan, throughout all his days he would utter the blessed words \"I have turned toward Thee, O God of the worlds, and I bear witness that Thou canst not be known except through Thyself, nor described save by Thyself,\" and would cause his will to be annihilated in the Will of God and his desire in His Desire. O Kazim! This ocean hath other waves, and this heaven other stars and suns. Who is able to hear? Until now the Supreme Pen hath not spoken as befitteth. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden, who hath turned toward Thy most exalted horizon, clinging to the cord of Thy loving-kindness, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the throne above and earth below. He acknowledgeth the sanctity of Thy Being above the recognition of any besides Thee, and Thy Self above the mention of aught except Thee. O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord! Thou seest the ignorant seeking the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge, the hopeful the carpet of Thy good-pleasure, and the poor the heaven of Thy riches. I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy Revelation, and by Thy Cord to which have clung the sincere ones and those nigh unto Thee, and by Thy hem whereunto have held fast the hands of Thy chosen ones and Thy trusted ones and the Concourse on high, that Thou write down for me with Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall preserve me from the intimations of any except Thee and the idle fancies of Thy servants. Then make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, and upright on Thy Most Great Path and Thy Mighty News. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThey inquired about one born outside the ordinance of God, whether he would attain to faith or not. The Herald declareth: The Tree of Negation through its acceptance becometh accounted as from the Tree of Affirmation, and the Tree of Affirmation through its rejection of the Truth is recorded as from the Tree of Negation in the Book. Implore God for confirmation that the servants may attain unto faith and drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness. Those souls who in their lifetime, like Shaykh Muhammad-Hasan-i-Najafi and his like, held in their grasp the reins of the faith of the people of Iran, and who in their own estimation were occupied night and day in writing the Book of God and in rejecting and condemning all the peoples of the world - when the Morn of Hope dawned and the blessed Tree of Divine Unity sprouted forth, they assailed it with swords and finally wrought that which caused the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Boundary to weep and the Most Exalted Pen to lament. Glory be to God! Repeatedly hath this utterance flowed from the Most Exalted Pen - observe ye what hath been revealed and ponder thereon, that perchance ye may preserve the weak ones from doubts and idle fancies, for the people of the Bayan have, like the people of old, formed a sect. God protect us and you from the evil of these souls who, being ignorant of the root of the Cause, have laid claim to knowledge and have girded up their loins to lead the people astray.\n\nInquiry was made about the condition of the weak ones in these days. We beseech God to make them strong in this Revelation, lest the doubts of the people and the intimations of those who have disbelieved in God, the Self-Subsisting, the Almighty, should prevent them. The Glory rest upon thee and upon her whose mention thou didst desire, and upon Our sincere male servants and Our sincere female servants.\n\n=== END BH00962 ===\n\n=== START BH00963 ===\n\nPraise be to God Who hath caused us to hear the decisive utterance, revealed unto us the Book, made manifest unto us the mystery of the beginning and the end, and guided us to the straight path. I pray and offer salutations and glorification unto those who have cast away vain imaginings, taken hold of the divine ordinances, and arisen to aid the Cause of their Lord, the Master of all beings, Who hath appeared in these days. These are servants through whom the mystery of divine unity hath been revealed, the horizon of steadfastness hath shone forth, and the nightingale hath warbled upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord of Names, Creator of the heavens, Who hast appeared in the kingdom of creation and hast dawned from the Most Exalted Horizon! Thou knowest and seest that this servant findeth himself powerless to make mention of those who have turned towards Thee with radiant faces and have witnessed in Thy love that which hath caused the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names to lament. I beseech Thee, O my God, to ordain for them every good thing recorded by the Pen in the Most Great Tablet. Then write for them that which will honor them with the supreme martyrdom before their spirits ascend unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nAnd now, O beloved of my heart, I have attained to thy letter which thou didst send from Ha and Mim, wherein thou didst recall the days when thou wert in the Most Great Prison, thy presence before the Countenance, and thy hearkening to the call of our Beloved and thy Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. After I read and understood its contents, I approached the Presence and presented that which was therein before the Throne. When this was completed, the Ancient Countenance turned toward me and said: \"O thou servant who art present! Take the Tablet and the Pen.\" When I took them, there were revealed from the heaven of His Will, for each of the names thou didst mention in thy letter, verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of earth nor by the riches of heaven. Exalted is this great bounty, this supreme gift, and this greatest mercy! This servant beseecheth his Lord that He may enable him and thee to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance at all times. Verily, He is the One, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nAnother submission is that several days ago this servant wrote a detailed petition to Jinab-i-Ism'ullah Jamal, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and likewise to Jinab-i-Mulla 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and likewise to Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib and Jinab-i-Ibn-i-'Attar, upon them both be Baha'u'llah's glory. God willing, it has arrived.\n\nAnother submission is that for some time mention of Jinab-i-Dhabi?, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, has not been seen in the blessed handwritings of the divine friends. The request is that you meet with him and convey from this evanescent one a wondrous and exalted greeting, saying: \"O thy burning and thy longing and thy attraction and thy enchantment and thy love and thy passion and thy rapture and thy ardor in God, the Lord of the worlds!\" Although this servant is certain that all that was mentioned exists, yet since for some time the ear and eye have not been blessed with hearing his words and beholding him, therefore these petitions are expressed.\n\nAnother submission is that according to the command, several souls who are adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, religiosity, and contentment, and who possess eloquence and utterance, should turn to various regions and with perfect wisdom engage in teaching the Cause. Tablets have been revealed to such an extent that it is impossible to enumerate them. From the Persian and Arabic, whatever is suitable for these days should be gathered and the divine words should be imparted according to the requirements of the station and the souls. God willing, may the warmth of assured souls dispel the coldness and frigidity of heedless souls.\n\nAnother submission is that in these days this servant has written some of the blessed Tablets according to the command, as at certain times the Most Exalted Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - was not present. We beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that your honor be assisted in the mention of the Truth, the praise of the Truth, and the teaching of the Cause of Truth, so that through it every seated one may arise, every silent one may speak, every turning away one may accept, every blind one may see, every tongue-tied one may talk, every lame one may walk, every agitated one may be assured, every doubting one may become certain, and every wavering one may become steadfast. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever turns to Him and the Answerer of every submissive, humble, and repentant petitioner.\n\nAll those circumambulating the Throne convey greetings to your honor, and likewise the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit and the spirits of all the world be sacrificed for them - remember your honor with the most wondrous, most impregnable, and most glorious mention. Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you among the loved ones of God in that place.\n\nThe Servant\n\n15 Dhi'l-?ijjih 1297\n\nThe number of revealed Tablets sent is twenty-one. God willing, may all attain unto them.\n\n=== END BH00963 ===\n\n=== START BH00964 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, His grandeur, and His power!\n\nPraise be to God Who made the seasons manifestations of His names amongst His servants, through which He takes and gives, that all existence, both seen and unseen, may be assured that He is the Bountiful Giver and the Just Taker. We find ourselves now in a cold that tells of bitter frost, through which man bears witness to the grace of spring. Verily, He is the Unveiler of all things through His might and sovereignty, the Sender-down of His signs and the Manifestor of His traces. For this let the competitors compete. To God do we belong and to Him do we return. Blessings and peace be upon the Manifestation of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, through Whom He subdued what was and what will be, and through Whom He revealed the mysteries of His Books and what was hidden in His knowledge, and upon His family and companions whom God made the dawning-places of His power and the daysprings of His might, through whom necks were made submissive to God's command, the Lord of Lords.\n\nThe letters from that spiritual friend arrived in succession. Praise be to God, each was a truthful messenger, a blessed courier, and a beloved herald, for the fragrance of love, affection and devotion wafted from them. After reading, I approached the Sacred Threshold where, after presentation, it was said: \"O Muhammad-Rida, upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names! I was seated upon the throne, contemplating God's power, sovereignty, might, grandeur and strength, when there came one who loved Me and read thy letter before My face. From it We found the fragrance of trust in God and detachment, and thy adherence to righteousness and godliness. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having made me acknowledge the unity of Thy Being and the sanctity of Thy Self above the recognition of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O Bestower of bounties and Quickener of moldering bones, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist me to exercise justice and fairness. O Lord! Thou seest the monotheists in the hands of the polytheists who have broken Thy covenant and Thy pact and have surrounded Thy cities and lands. O Lord! Ordain for me and Thy servants the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne and earth, and in Thy grasp is the reins of all things. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.\"\n\nThis evanescent one begs his Everlasting Lord to rain down upon you from the clouds of grace the showers of His bounty, and to adorn you in all conditions with the ornament of health, well-being and favor. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Mention was made of His Eminence the Effendi, may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him. In truth, from his name joy appears in the heart. This is naught but a divine hidden grace deposited in his innermost being. Then, according to his desire, he attained the presence, and after presentation of his mention, it was said: \"We beseech God, the Lord of all beings, the Lord of the Sacred House, the Sacred Monument and Station, to ordain for him every good that He has sent down in His Book, to open before his face the gate of munificence and generosity, and the gate of blessing, glory and wealth among the nations, and to give him to drink, at all times, from the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Gracious.\"\n\nPraise be to God that they have been mentioned in this most exalted remembrance. Verily this Tree of Remembrance hath had and shall ever have its traces and fruits, which shall be made manifest in due time. This is a great glad-tiding. This servant also beseecheth God and imploreth Him to ordain for his honor that which will exalt him amongst His servants and make him a sign of His glory amidst His creation. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer, and the Fulfiller of the needs of every penitent supplicant.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Regarding what was repeatedly mentioned in the letters about journeying to Syria during the season for the sake of certain trees which are the source of goodness in the world - I express my gratitude for this matter even before its execution and am truly thankful, for whatsoever that beloved of the heart hath written hath been and is from the depths of the heart. In this case, journeying to that direction is not necessary. And concerning what was written about His Honor the Afandi - may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him - having willed to send quince from that direction to this direction: yes, quince is good and is also available in this city. And if distinguished trees from there can be sent without trouble, and likewise the Mastaki apricots that were mentioned, it would be beloved. And this too, considering that it is a good deed done in his name that shall remain and endure in a place specifically arranged for the recreation of the monotheists, is assuredly acceptable before God and before those near to Him. For one of the primary reasons for the creation of the world is what was mentioned - namely, that beneficent and charitable works from assured souls should be remembered and all should attain unto them. This is why God, exalted be His glory, hath mentioned in His Perspicuous Book, which distinguisheth between truth and falsehood, the mention of paradise and fruits and trees. And this matter, in one respect, is purely for the education of creation, that they might act virtuously and through this blessed deed attain unto lofty stations. The servant testifieth that all bounty is in His right hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\n\nAnd regarding the matter of the Salihiyyih grapes, if without difficulty and with utmost ease, whatever amount of its branches can be sent, God willing, may it be the cause of increased reward for His Honor the Afandi - may God assist him. Whatsoever is truly the cause and reason for good works and virtuous deeds hath been mentioned and accepted in the divine books of the past and present. God willing, may the effects of these good deeds be made manifest in the material world and yield their fruits. Verily God is the Generous Giver and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nThe apple of my eye, His Honor Aqa Mirza Mustafa - upon him be God's loving-kindness - is mindful, praise be to God, and now too sendeth greetings and praise, maketh mention of you, and beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, on your behalf whatsoever is worthy of His bestowal. He is the One through Whose name the ocean of generosity surged and the sun of bounty shone upon the world. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace and mercy and loving-kindness from God be upon you and upon God's righteous servants. And praise be to God, for He is the Lord of the worlds and the Master of the Day of Judgment.\n\nThe Servant\n\n7 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1307\n\nThe Branches of the Blessed Tree and the people of the pavilion of infallibility all make mention of your honor and send their greetings, and beseech from the Lord of existence exaltation and elevation for that beloved spirit.\n\n=== END BH00964 ===\n\n=== START BH00965 ===\n\nThis is what hath dawned from the horizon of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. O My Name! Today is the day of divine assistance and, by the truth of My Being, all the realities of the exalted ones and the spirits of those nigh unto God who circle round have beseeched to appear in the outward vesture of human temples and arise to aid the Cause of God in the visible realm. It beseemeth no one to seek departure from this world in the days of the manifestation of the Lord of Eternity. Rather must all, at all times, be turned toward the horizon of the All-Merciful and beseech God that some service to this most wondrous and impregnable Cause might be manifested from him, even if it be but the mention of one of His words. This, verily, is a great bounty, a great good, and a great matter.\n\nAs to approaching the Most Holy Court in these days, this is outwardly not permitted. We have revealed in one of the Tablets: \"How many are near whom We do not confirm in their nearness, and how many are remote and, by the Self of the Beloved, are yet nigh!\" And in another Tablet: \"How many who are near are yet strangers, and how many who are distant are yet near! Blessed is he who is near and drew near!\" And in yet another Tablet: \"How many a beloved one became but a bubble, and how many a companion We found to be a flatterer, and how many who were distant are near, and how many who were near We testify are in a station remote.\"\n\nThough it is evident that no grace, bounty, station or rank can ever equal attaining the presence of God in the visible realm, I swear by the Sun of the glory of oneness, rising from the dawning-place of detachment in My Name, the All-Powerful, that nothing can equal appearing before the Throne in the visible realm, even for a moment, though one possessed all that is in the heavens and earth. Some people have been deprived of the divine spiritual wine-house. Thus have the effects of these matters and their fruits remained hidden from their sight. Therefore they remain occupied with their own imaginings and veiled from the Lord of all beings.\n\nThe purpose is this: many souls, in the very midst of nearness, are deprived of attainment, while many souls who are outwardly remote attain to the waters of reunion. This is from the bounty of thy Lord, the Giver, the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed is the soul that hath attained both, detached from all save His good-pleasure and annihilated in the good-pleasure of his Lord. By God! No deed can equal this.\n\nIf this veil were to be rent asunder by the finger of the will of the Lord of Lords, thou wouldst witness all who are on earth, both the mighty and the lowly, cast behind them poverty and wealth, sovereignty and glory, and hasten to that station whereof every atom of its dust proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.\"\n\nO Beauty of the Essence of Oneness, Who is sanctified above all limitations and purified from words, allusions, names, attributes, manifestations and revelations, hath appeared in human temple. Therefore most people, looking upon human habits manifested from the Divine Temple, remain veiled, heedless that herein lies the essence of power. Reflect that thou mayest know, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds! Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Essence of Power that calleth from behind Thee: \"Thine are the greatness and the might, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of the worlds!\" And praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Essence of Greatness that calleth: \"Greatness is Thine, O Thou through Whose manifestation the faces of those near unto Thee were illumined!\"\n\n\\[...\\] O Jamal! These humiliations that have befallen thee were for the sake of God's Cause, and this is a glory excelling all glories. By God! If thou but knew, thou wouldst find solace in humiliation and say: \"O humiliation! May my soul be a sacrifice unto thee! Where art thou? I have accepted thee all for my Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\" Thou hast attained unto far more than thou didst desire. God willing, He will cause thee to know what He hath intended for thee, that thou mayest rejoice and soar and say: \"Unto Thee be praise, O Thou Who art the Praise of all worlds!\" The head of Baha hath been adorned with the crown of tribulation, and in this doth He glory amidst earth and heaven. True glory lieth not in what the people comprehend; rather, all glory is in the humiliation We have borne for God's Cause, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. We have ordained for thee what We have loved, that thy remembrance might endure in the realm of dust amongst Our sincere servants, in the Kingdom amongst the angels drawn nigh, and in the Realm of Might amongst God's chosen ones, they who are detached from all else save Him. Can any bounty equal this which thou didst desire? Nay, by My mercy that hath embraced all worlds! O Jamal! If thou wouldst inhale from the outer meanings of what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken the sweet-scented breezes of inner significance and certitude, thou wouldst assuredly know that whatsoever hath appeared from Him shall endure as long as the dominion of earth and heaven endureth, and that it is better for thee than all that was and shall be. The fragrance of the Beloved's raiment hath been diffused through that which hath been revealed at this hour, and by it have the dwellers of earth and heaven been perfumed. Blessed are they that attain thereunto.\n\nWhatsoever We have desired for Ourselves, We have desired and continue to desire for Our sincere loved ones. By My life! Soon shalt thou find thyself in manifest glory. Be not grieved by straits and distress. Occupy thyself with God's Cause. He shall assuredly set right all things. Be thou assured and numbered among the thankful ones. As for what thou hast mentioned regarding certain differences, this is what hath been sent down in the Tablets from thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed: \"Whoso layeth claim to a Cause before the completion of a full thousand years is verily a lying impostor. And whoso interpreteth this verse differently is indeed among the most lost.\" And in another Tablet: \"Whoso layeth claim to a Cause before the completion of a full thousand years is verily a lying impostor. We beseech God that He may assist him to repent should he repent. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving. And should he persist in what he hath claimed, there shall be raised up against him one who will show him no mercy. Verily thy Lord is severe in punishment.\" For these souls have been and shall continue to be the cause of harm to the root of the Cause and the source of discord among the people. Were it to be thus, that every ignorant one might understand as he pleased, then never would the divine Tree of the Cause be established amongst men, nor would God's commandments and laws become effective and operative. Strange indeed is the lack of understanding among the people! However, some attribute certain things to others out of their selfish desires, but with thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. The truth hath never been, nor shall it ever be, obscured from Him. Verily He is the All-Knowing.\n\n=== END BH00965 ===\n\n=== START BH00966 ===\n\n\\[...\\] All praise, sanctified from peer and likeness, befitteth the Eternal, the Ever-Abiding, the Beloved Who perisheth not, Who, through the sovereignty of His Will and the potency of His Purpose, hath made this mansion the Most Great Scene of Revelation and the Seat of His Throne, and Who, through the movement of the Most Exalted Pen, hath summoned all creation unto the most sublime horizon. He hath bestowed upon all the worlds a drop from the ocean of His knowledge; some turned towards Him while others turned away, forsaking eternal stations through their attachment to ephemeral things. At all times the cooing of the doves of remembrance and utterance is raised, yet most are deprived thereof. They have clung to conjectural divines and are thus barred from the ocean of certitude. Exalted, exalted be His dominion! Exalted, exalted be His proof! Exalted, exalted be His command! Exalted, exalted be His glory above description through letters and words, or attribution through that which the peoples of earth and heaven can comprehend! The most perfect and complete antidote hath appeared through the blessing of the Most Great Name, yet most are afflicted with the diseases of ignorance and folly. The Water of Life surgeth before the faces of men, and the Sun of Grace shineth resplendent above their heads, yet all remain veiled save whom our Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, willeth. By God! Were the servants to attain unto a drop from the Most Great Ocean, surely a hundred thousand worlds and whatsoever hath been created therein would not withhold them from the Most Sublime Horizon. This servant is feeble and the degrees of exposition are beyond reckoning, yet withal he is commanded to silence. The decree belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I testify that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been and shall ever be. None hath known Him save to the extent permitted. He is the Expositor, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. My spirit be a sacrifice for your acceptance, and my soul be a ransom for your steadfastness! The servant hath attained unto that from which wafted the sweet savours of the remembrance of the Beloved - your letter which testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth, that there is none other God but Him. The sweetness of your mention seized me in such wise as can neither be described by the pen nor by the tongue, for it was adorned with the praise of God, the Lord of all worlds. When I succeeded in opening and reading it, I turned toward the Seat of the Throne and presented all that was therein before His Presence. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur - my spirit be a sacrifice for His utterance - spoke, and His sweetest of sayings was: \"O thou who art present! He hath testified to that whereunto God hath testified, and hath recognized the Revelation of God and His sovereignty, after which most of the mystics and eloquent ones remained veiled therefrom, and hath known the Day wherein the Truth shall arise and speak amongst creation. Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and his testimony unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, shall endure.\" Here ended His words.\n\nAt this point such utterances were revealed as this servant was and ever shall be utterly powerless to recount them all. Such words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of utterance that were even a fraction less than a hair's breadth of their light to be shed upon the earth, all would be freed and sanctified from their limited spans and would in all conditions turn unto the Ultimate Goal. This much glad-tidings do I give unto that honoured person, that his mention was accepted in the Most Holy Court. \\[...\\]\n\n\\[...\\] You wrote that you occasionally associate with officials for the purpose of attending to outward affairs. This was presented before His presence, and He said: \"This matter is most praiseworthy. In the Kitab-i-Aqdas, all are permitted to associate with different groups, and association with rulers and officials is permissible for several beneficial purposes. Through such association, oftentimes an oppressed one may find deliverance, or a prisoner may be freed, and perchance words may be spoken that cause awakening. Association with such persons is a hundred thousand times preferable to association with the heedless divines and theologians. Nevertheless, association with the divines has also been permitted, that perchance someone may become mindful or gain fear of God. Even as the Most Great Branch - may our souls be a sacrifice for all else beside Him - associates daily with rulers, officials and divines, and continuously maintains relations with people of every kind. Beyond these considerations, all have been commanded to pursue a trade or profession, and this station necessitates association with various classes of people. Similarly, in another instance He said: Write to them that We have given you permission for association and the pursuit of your claims. The people of God must associate with all in the utmost spirit of joy and fragrance, that perchance those lost in the valley of error may attain the lights of guidance. Jesus, son of Mary, associated with tax collectors, and most people objected. He said: I have come to associate with sinners that they might become aware and turn from falsehood to truth. Association, kindliness and the like are among the attributes of wisdom which all are commanded to manifest. We beseech God to assist Me in loving you and mentioning you in the presence of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Great, and to protect the believers from the braying of every brayer, the croaking of every croaker, the barking of every denier, and the howling of every heedless one. Verily He is the Protector, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Invincible. In the years when the Throne was established in Arabic Iraq, at the end of those days when He intended to migrate, He warned the people in most Tablets about the birds of darkness and the clamor of the croakers. Likewise in the Land of Mystery, and also in the Most Great Prison, He specifically stated that the people must again be warned so they might be preserved from such souls. And now in some lands the barking of dogs is raised, and this servant is astonished how people remain veiled from the Supreme Horizon and are deprived of the truth by the words of those who cannot distinguish between right and left. Fie upon them and their understanding and what their hands have wrought! We take refuge with God from the evil of these heedless, deceitful croakers. Under all conditions, praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds. And the glory be upon you and those with you and those who love you, from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\n=== END BH00966 ===\n\n=== START BH00967 ===\n\nPraise be sanctified above all that hath been and shall be, befitting that Self-Subsisting Lord Who, through the light of His creative Word \"Be!\", hath enabled sheer nothingness to attain the mantle of existence. The blessed word \"and it is!\" hath been and ever shall be a witness to this manifest and resplendent power. The convulsions of the world and the oppression of nations have neither prevented nor deterred Him from His purpose, though at times, in accordance with the requirements of consummate wisdom, the manifestations of grace and favor are made to pause. And since most have no access to the City of understanding of this station, they become possessed of vain imaginings.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord, and my Support! I beseech Thee by the oceans of Thy patience and forbearance, and by Thy power and might, to enable the ignorant to draw nigh unto the City of Thy knowledge, and the rulers to the court of Thy justice. Thou art verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention and utterance, your arising and your steadfastness! For some time, outwardly no news had been received from your honour, although praise be to God, repeatedly from the tongue of the Goal of the world was heard, specifically concerning your honour, that which is the cause of eternal joy and gladness. And after attaining the presence on this day, these exalted words were revealed and sent down from the tongue of grandeur, exalted be His utterance and magnificent His proof:\n\nIn My Name, the Wronged One\n\nO My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and the glory of all who are in My kingdom! This Wronged One is afflicted each day with fresh calumnies. Glory be to God! Lies and calumnies have reached such a point as cannot be recounted or expressed. Each soul who turneth toward this direction, from behind the hill arriveth word that he hath stolen large sums of money from merchants and brought it to Akka. Although these matters are the cause of grief, yet since they are for the sake of God they are the water of life and are in truth the manifestation of joy and delight. The world and all that is therein, in relation to God, blessed and exalted be He, are loved and accepted, but if this relationship be severed they are not worth a penny. Praise be to God, whatsoever hath befallen Us, its purpose is clear and evident to the Afnan of the Divine Lote-Tree, manifest as the sun and apparent to all. Deeds are the mirror of existence and the record of rank and station. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having revealed unto me that which was concealed from Thy servants and treasured up through Thy power and might. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the lights of Thy justice and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, to assist the heedless to turn unto Thee and to face the door of Thy bounty. Then open unto me, O my Master and my King, the doors of Thy mercy and Thy generosity in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.\n\nVerily each of these mentions is a key to unlock a door, and when its time cometh it shall open a matter from God, the Opener, the Bountiful. O Afnan! Upon thee be My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy. For some time now Afnan, Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, hath attained the presence and dwelt in the vicinity, and their affairs have been in upheaval. Although these upheavals are the means of tranquility and assurance, for the Afnan were created for the promotion of God's Cause - when outwardly restricted, inwardly they are engaged in service to the Cause of God, blessed and exalted be He. Your honor is aware and can testify to what was mentioned. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, first to set right his affairs through His bounty and generosity, and to ordain for him that which shall profit and enrich him, and to strengthen him in all His worlds. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous Giver. Your honor must also strive diligently to the extent possible to set right \\[their affairs\\]. I beseech the True One in all conditions for whatsoever conduces to glory, exaltation and grace. Verily He is powerful over all things. The Most Great Branch hath repeatedly made mention of your honor and sought \\[divine\\] confirmation and grace. We beseech God to fulfill the needs of His Afnan through His might, power and sovereignty. Convey greetings to the Afnan on behalf of the Wronged One. They are remembered in all conditions and are recipients of grace. We beseech God to exalt them through His Name and make them banners of His guidance amongst His creation. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you and hearken unto your words concerning this manifest Cause.\n\nThe upheavals that occurred revealed hidden matters. One who was shown the utmost favor eventually spent days and nights heeding the insinuations of the calumniators. Indeed what a strange veil hath been rent asunder. Even when the honored Afnan, Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, turned towards this direction, they telegraphed to Beirut that Siyyid Ahmad and his servant Nasru'llah had stolen a sum of cash and some banknotes and were headed to that land. Shaykh Muhammad Yazdi is engaged in such matters that his true nature and the nature of those who led him astray might be revealed. Verily God is the Expositor, the All-Wise. This is the Day when the secrets of hearts and the treachery of eyes are exposed. God, the Exalted, the Great, hath spoken truth.\n\nAttention to setting right the affairs of the honored Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God and His grace, who are determined \\[to depart\\], depends on your honor's attention, and surely you will attend to it to the extent possible. I present my utter nothingness and evanescence, and glory and radiance, to the honored Afnan of the Sacred Tree, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God. God the One is witness that they are ever remembered in the Most Holy Court. This supreme bounty hath no equal, and the divine Books, both past and future, bear witness to this. This evanescent servant hath at all times beseeched and continues to beseech from the Self-Sufficient Lord whatsoever conduces to their exaltation and elevation. Surely all that hath been and will be entreated shall be answered. With the generous no task is difficult. The Most Glorious Glory and the Most Exalted Praise be upon your honor and upon those who love you and hearken unto your words, your mention and \\[your utterance\\] in remembrance of God's Great Announcement and His manifest Cause. And praise be to Him, for He is the Beloved of all worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n9 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1308\n\n=== END BH00967 ===\n\n=== START BH00968 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who hath dominion over all who are in the kingdom of names! A remembrance from Us unto him who hath been remembered by the Mention and turned unto the Countenance when it appeared in truth, and was among them that turned, and hath been inscribed by the Pen of Command upon the Tablet. Know thou the measure of this station, then act in accordance with that which beseemeth this Day which was promised in the Tablets. Immerse thyself at all times in the seas of wisdom and utterance. Thus doth the All-Merciful command thee as a token of His grace, for verily He hath knowledge of all things. Be thou in such wise that what the people possess entereth not thy heart, nor is that which is falsely spoken among men mentioned before thy face. Among the people are those whom the winds of idle fancies have stirred and held back from the shore of My Name, the Manifest, the Hidden. Thus hath the matter been decreed. And among them are those whom the attraction of the Call hath so seized that they have cast aside all created things and turned toward the horizon which shineth with the lights of revelation. Say: The mountains have been moved by the fragrances of the Day of Return, and the Mount hath borne witness to this Manifestation which hath been known by its own Self. Say: The people's possessions alter Him not, nor doth the might of those who have been deprived of justice restrain Him. He speaketh at all times that which He is bidden by the Lord of all religions. To this testifieth he who hath witnessed Beauty from the horizon of glory. Among the people are those who have cast aside what was commanded in the Tablets and have taken their own desires for a path. And among them are those who have been veiled by knowledge from the Sovereign of all knowledge and have followed every vain imagination, having halted upon the path. Say: Beware lest the multitude of the people's books hold you back from Our Name, the Self-Subsisting. Consider the sinful one: he hath filled his house with books, yet not a single letter thereof profited him. Thus was the matter decreed, as witnesseth he who was endowed with true vision. Had these things profited him, he would not have rejected the Book of God behind his back, nor would he have opposed Him by Whose Name all religions have been sent down in truth from the heaven of revelation. Among the divines are those who write what their idle fancies inspire them, turning aside from the Pen from which have flowed the springs of wisdom and utterance. Woe unto him and unto those who follow him! Soon shall they find themselves in fires kindled by the wrath of God. O My loved ones! Be not grieved by what hath befallen you. By God, ye shall behold yourselves in a station illumined by the lights of the Throne. That which ye behold hath no permanence. All in the kingdom shall perish, and there shall endure only that which hath been ordained for you in a dominion raised up in the name of God. Among the people is he who claimeth the inner meaning and thereby holdeth back the people from a path which hath been straight in the eternal past. Say: The inner meaning is this Outward One Who proclaimeth from the midmost heart of the world that the Lord of all nations hath come - He Who was hidden behind the veils of the unseen in glory. Whoso speaketh today what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, verily he is of the people of infallibility. God hath preserved him through a sovereignty that encompasseth the worlds. Thy letter hath come before the Face, and We found therein thy passion for God, thy yearning for the ocean of His presence, and thy burning in separation from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. He beareth thee witness of attainment and hath ordained for thee the reward of one who hath gained His presence, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Blessed art thou, for thy letter hath been presented and read in a presence wherein its very dust particles proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the Lord of all worlds. God hath thereby forgiven thy mother and thy sisters and admitted them beneath the shadow of His mercy which hath preceded all things. Glorify their countenances, then mention them from Me through this bounty which hath appeared from the horizon of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have ordained for thee what thou didst desire of God's grace and mercy. Be thou assured and of those who are thankful. Make mention of My loved ones in that place. Say: Follow that which ye have been commanded in the Tablets. This is better for you, if ye be of those who know. It behooveth every soul to follow that which he hath been commanded, detached from all else in creation. This is the religion of God, from before and after. Blessed is every discerning scholar. Verily, the glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and thy sisters and upon those who have held fast to this firm cord.\n\nIn the Name of the One Friend:\n\nGod willing, through the grace of the All-Merciful, you must be the cupbearer of the wine of recognition, that perchance lifeless souls may attain eternal life through this enduring wine. The divine call hath been raised in such wise that it hath encompassed all creation; nevertheless, most weak souls remain heedless and veiled in the veils of idle fancies. By the Sun of Truth! From the inception of this wondrous creation until now, no such call hath been raised, yet through desire they have been debarred from hearkening unto it. Some are occupied with interpretation, heedless of the explicit text, while others cling to the branch, veiled from the root. Were the veil to be lifted, they would bewail their own selves - but they are among the dead.\n\nThe matter which is and shall ever be obligatory and essential is the teaching of God's Cause, as hath been revealed in most of the Tablets. Your honor must engage in this most great, most mighty cause with perfect wisdom and protect the weak from the vain imaginings of those who count themselves among the learned, that all may drink from the spring of supreme steadfastness and attain unto this station which is the most exalted summit and ultimate purpose. Should souls be found in that land who would arise to teach God's Cause in surrounding villages, purely for the sake of God, this would be most beloved. However, such souls must be the knights of the field of detachment, in such wise that they regard all save God as utter nothingness and behold the banner of \"There is no God but Him\" raised over all regions. They must move for God, speak for God, and strive in God, and journey unto God.\n\nO servant turning unto the Face! The Cause is extremely mighty, and the plotters lie in ambush with the utmost cunning and deceit. The souls must be reminded at all times, lest through the promptings of malicious souls they be debarred from the path of oneness. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions, to make thee one who speaketh in His name, who gazeth toward His direction, and who moveth by His leave. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty. And praise be to God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00968 ===\n\n=== START BH00969 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Supreme, the Most Great!\n\nHe is God, exalted is His station in majesty and power!\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for You! Some time ago, a petition was submitted in the company of Nabil-i-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God. This servant has again desired to cause trouble and occupy Your presence with these words which in truth express the limitations of this servant. Whenever one of the friends sets out for the abode of that Beloved One, this servant involuntarily clings to writing and composition, that perchance through this means he may be mentioned in Your exalted service. Although it has been long since the fragrant breezes of Your pen have passed by, nevertheless this servant has not paused for a moment, continuously and successively sending petitions and correspondence from various directions. Again in these days when his honor Amin, upon him be the glory of God, was setting out for Your presence, this petition was submitted. As commanded, it was decided that the aforementioned should remain in this land and his journey was excused. However, afterward he himself requested to make one journey to return and arrange his affairs in that direction and come back quickly. Since he departed suddenly, therefore several Tablets were sent specifically for Your presence and for those related to You and for a few of the loved ones of God. God willing, more will be sent hereafter. If you ask about the conditions of the prison, sufficient is what hath been revealed concerning it. In any case, this servant is bewildered day and night that while the ocean of bounties is manifest, the sun of favor is shining, the horizon of generosity is luminous, and verses are being revealed like torrential rain, how is it that people remain heedless and veiled, and have not been moved by the breezes of the days of God which are in truth the essence of life for all worlds and the cause of the quaking of all that is in the heavens and earth. We bear witness as God hath witnessed concerning them that they are dead, not living. Although in one sense this servant observes that just as it is, is beloved, as was said before: \"Nothing in creation is more perfect than what is.\" Blessed are the sincere ones. Today is the day of the sincere ones. Today is the day of those drawn nigh. They drink from the cups of recognition despite the people of creation, and they partake of the Kawthar of life, hidden from those who have denied the All-Merciful. Surely those souls are content with these conditions, for they stand at the highest station of jealousy and certainly do not accept unworthy rivals. Well is it with them and pleasant it is for them. My spirit and my being be a sacrifice for them. By the life of God, were my Lord and Master to permit me, I would manifest in the world through His name that which would cause every atom to dance, every created thing to be attracted, and every weighty thing to hasten. All these veils are caused by numerous souls, and they are the ignorant divines who are known among the people by the name of learning. Neither do they themselves attain, nor are they content with the attainment of others. May God protect us and the company of the monotheists from these satans. But they have conceived vain imaginings. In their fancy, each day they cling to something that might be the cause of their glory among people, heedless that the Supreme Pen has struck out the word of glory that was associated with them. Never will they find glory nor will they see it. Like Qarun (Korah), they sink into the earth at every moment.\n\nThose who are not detached and are not spiritual will never attain loftiness, even if they should cling to every means. The difference is that Qarun sank into the physical earth, while such souls sink into the earth of self and desire. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from their evil, their schemes, their deceit, their guile, their pride and their vanity. Consider that from the day the divines in Iraq rose up in opposition, most were seen to be abased and cast down, and some returned to their abode in hellfire. What more can this evanescent servant say? In truth it is a pity - nay a hundred pities - that mention of such souls should flow from the pen in such days as these. Shame upon them and their loyalty! Sufficient unto them is what hath been revealed concerning them. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Revealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nConvey greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to all the friends, and say to them on behalf of this servant: O friends! Such days as these have never been seen nor shall be seen again. Know ye their worth and, with perfect fellowship and unity, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of the Lord of the Day of Judgment, that perchance ailing souls may drink from the sea of healing and distant servants attain to the Kawthar of nearness. For whatsoever is manifested from any soul today shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. God willing, may all be refreshed and gladdened by the vernal breezes of the All-Merciful. These breezes are not like the known breezes that pass in an instant and cease. Rather these are breezes that shall never be cut off from pure and holy hearts, for they waft from the direction of the garment of the Beloved and pass from the Most Great Prison which is the seat of the throne of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath found and known! Blessed is he who hath inhaled and breathed in! Blessed is he who hath turned toward Him with his breast stripped bare of coverings! And blessed is he who hath turned wholly unto Him, sanctified from all directions!\n\nWhatever I might say is in truth little, even though it be much. Therefore brevity is best. Verily our All-Knowing Lord is the Interpreter, the All-Informed. In any case, in these days the honored Amin beareth witness that this servant hath not had and hath not the opportunity to speak, for matters have reached such a pass that I am continuously present and occupied with the revelation of verses, as petitions have arrived and continue to arrive from all directions. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist me in that which I have been commanded. Today, although there remain many writings that must be completed today, nevertheless permission was obtained from the Source of Grandeur and I became occupied with writing this letter, out of my love for your honor, O thou who hast aided the Cause of our Lord, the All-Bestowing.\n\n=== END BH00969 ===\n\n=== START BH00970 ===\n\nIn the name of Him through Whose remembrance the hearts of the Concourse on High are quickened!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! Thou dost witness and behold how I have been tried amongst Thy servants, though I desired naught but to humble myself before the door of Thy mercy which Thou hast opened unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. I have commanded them only what Thou didst command me, and called them only to that whereunto Thou didst raise me up. By Thy glory! I desired not to exalt myself above anyone in any matter, nor to glory over them through what Thou hast bestowed upon me through Thy bounty and favor. For I find within myself, O my God, no manifestation before Thy manifestation, nor any authority save after Thy permission and will. Rather, at every moment my heart doth cry, \"Would that I were dust whereupon tread the feet of Thy sincere ones among Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones among Thy pure ones!\" Were one possessed of hearing to turn unto my members, he would hear from my outer and inner being, my heart and tongue, my veins and limbs, \"Would that there might appear from me that which would gladden the hearts of those who have tasted the sweetness of the remembrance of my Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and that through my call someone might ascend to the heaven of Thy Cause and the kingdom of Thy knowledge, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of eternity and the realm of creation!\"\n\nAnd if I say, \"Unto me, unto me, O people of creation!\", I desire by this naught but Thy Cause through which Thou hast manifested me and raised me up, that all might turn unto the seat of Thy oneness and the throne of Thy singleness. Thou knowest, O Beloved of Baha and Desire of Baha, that he desireth naught but Thy love and Thy good-pleasure, and he wisheth to purify the hearts of Thy servants from the promptings of self and passion, and to bring them to the City of Eternity that they might be united in Thy Cause and gathered together under the standard of Thy good-pleasure.\n\nBy Thy glory, O my Beloved! Were Thou to afflict me at every moment with a fresh tribulation, it would be more beloved to me than that there should occur among Thy loved ones that which would sadden their hearts or cause their unity to be scattered. For Thou hast raised me up only for their unity in Thy Cause - before which the creation of Thy heaven and earth cannot endure - and for their detachment from all else but Thee, their turning unto the horizon of Thy mighty glory, and their orientation toward the direction of Thy good-pleasure. Therefore, O my God, send down from the clouds of Thy hidden grace that which will purify them from sorrows and human limitations, that the Concourse on High might perceive from them the fragrances of sanctity and detachment.\n\nThen aid them, O my God, unto the unity which Thou hast desired, which is that none should behold another save that he beholdeth in him the revelation wherewith Thou didst reveal Thyself unto him in this Manifestation, whose covenant Thou didst take in the atoms of the Bayan from all who dwell in the realms of being. Whoso gazeth upon this most mighty, most glorious station and this most great, most resplendent condition will never show pride toward anyone. Blessed are they who have attained unto this station; they consort with all in the spirit of joy and fragrance. This is of the unity which Thou hast ever loved and ordained for the sincere among Thy servants and the near ones among Thy creatures.\n\nTherefore I beseech Thee, O King of Kings, by Thy Name through which Thou didst establish the law of love and concord among Thy servants, to create among Thy loved ones that which will render them united in all things, that through them may be manifested the signs of Thy unity among Thy creatures and the evidences of Thy oneness in Thy kingdom. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThe Most Exalted Pen proclaims: O friends of Truth! The purpose of bearing these successive tribulations and consecutive trials is that souls firm in their faith in God should walk together in perfect unity, in such wise that all difference, duality and strangeness might be effaced from their midst, save within those special bounds that have been revealed in the Divine Books. The man of insight suffers no deficiency in any matter; whatsoever occurs is evidence of the greatness of his station and the purity of his nature. For instance, if one shows humility for God's sake toward the friends of God, this humility in truth returns unto God, as it regards his faith in God. In this case, if the other person does not reciprocate in like manner, or shows pride, the man of insight has attained and will attain unto the exaltation of his deed and its reward, while the harmful consequence of the opposing person's deed returns unto himself. Likewise, if anyone shows pride toward another, that pride returns unto God - God forbid! O ye who are endowed with insight! I swear by the Most Great Name, it is a pity that in these days anyone should fix his gaze upon transient conditions. Stand firm in the Divine Cause and conduct yourselves with utmost love toward one another, purely for the sake of the Beloved. Consume the veils of self with the fire of oneness, and associate with each other with radiant and joyous faces. Ye have all witnessed with your own eyes the attributes of Truth - that never did He desire that a night should pass with any of God's loved ones bearing ill-feeling toward this Servant. The heart of the world is ablaze with the Divine Word - what a pity if ye be not enkindled by this fire! We hope, God willing, that ye will make this blessed night a night of unity, that ye will all unite together and adorn yourselves with praiseworthy and excellent character. Let your endeavor be to guide a soul from the gulf of mortality to the fountain of immortality, and to conduct yourselves among men in such wise that the signs of Truth may be manifest in you. For ye are the first of existence, the first of worshippers, the first of those who prostrate themselves, and the first of those who circle round in adoration. By Him Who hath caused Me to speak what He desireth! Your names are more renowned in the Most Exalted Kingdom than your mention is among yourselves. Think not this utterance to be vain imagination. Would that ye could see what your Lord, the All-Merciful, perceiveth of the loftiness of your station, the greatness of your worth, and the sublimity of your rank! We beseech God that your selves and your desires may not prevent you from that which hath been ordained for you. We hope that ye will conduct yourselves with one another in the utmost affection, love and friendship, in such wise that through your unity the standard of oneness may be raised aloft and the banner of polytheism cast down, and that ye may outstrip one another in good deeds and in showing forth that which He desireth - His is the creation and the command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And verily He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.\n\n=== END BH00970 ===\n\n=== START BH00971 ===\n\nO Mulla Shafi', upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of utterance. This is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful to him who hath drunk the choice wine of revelation and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: that there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, that the utterance of his Lord may draw him to the highest pinnacle of knowledge and bring him near unto Him on this Day whereon all things proclaim: \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of the worlds!\" O Shafi'! Hearken unto that which My Most Exalted Pen hath voiced in this Most Holy, Most Glorious, Most Exalted Station, which God hath made the point round which circle them that are in the heavens and on earth. Thou hast been mentioned before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names. Verily thy Lord is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. Beware lest the gestures of the people sadden thee from My Self-Subsisting Name, through which My sealed wine was unsealed and all things proclaimed: \"The Possessor of all hath come and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\" O Shafi'! He hath come Who was mentioned in the hearts of the Prophets and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God. Blessed is he who hath recognized Him and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!\" Say: He hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in knowledge, and hath spoken before the faces of the world in such wise that neither the veils of the wrongdoers nor the gestures of the heedless have hindered Him. Among the people are those who turned towards Him and drank the choice wine of revelation, and among them are those who turned away in such manner as caused My Herald in the Most Exalted Paradise and Muhammad the Apostle of God in the All-Highest Paradise to lament. However, most of the people are heedless. They have cast the Cause of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies. Say: Fear God, and deny not His favor, dispute not His verses, and reject not His grace which hath encompassed all things both small and great. Behold, then mention those who denied the All-Merciful when He came with proof and evidence, and spoke that which none before had spoken. Thus did their souls prompt them to a matter, and today they are amongst the dead. Arise to serve the Cause by God's leave and His sovereignty in such wise as to cause the hearts of the people of the Bayan to tremble - they who have broken the Covenant and turned away from Him in Whom they had formerly believed. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers in God's mighty and glorious Book. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them unto thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are thankful. When thou art blessed by them and findest the fragrance of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Merciful, arise and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world and the Manifest One through the Most Great Name, for having made Thyself known unto me, shown forth Thy proof unto me, and sent down Thy verses unto me. I testify that Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\"\n\nIn the Persian tongue We make mention, that all the people of that land may comprehend the Will of God and stand firm and steadfast in His Cause. This is the Day of steadfastness and the Day of assistance through goodly deeds and pleasing conduct. O Shafi', the people of the Bayan, like unto the people of the Furqan, have clung to vain imaginings and idle fancies, and are diligently engaged in leading the servants astray. Not for a moment have they pondered what the fruits of the deeds, words and beliefs of the Shi'ih party have been. By God! They are in manifest delusion. For twelve hundred years and more they nurtured the helpless masses on vain imaginings and idle fancies, and the result was that they martyred the Purpose of all worlds with hands of hatred. All the ignorant ones of the earth - that is, the lands of Persia - pronounced their verdict to shed the blood of the Sovereign of existence, the Lord of the seen and unseen. And by the ignorant ones are meant the divines of that realm who have been and continue to be the cause of the peoples' rejection and opposition. And now the people of the Bayan are seen to be even more lost, more astray and more remote. They have cast aside certitude and taken fancy as their lord instead of God. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers in God's Book, the Lord of all worlds. The Sovereign of existence Who from the beginning of the Cause stood before the faces of all nations and spoke forth in praise and glorification, Who brought that which all the books of the past cannot equal - Him have they denied, imagining themselves to be among the people of truth, even as the Shi'ih party, despite their utter wretchedness, considered themselves more exalted, more elevated and more learned than anyone else on earth. Yet when the test came, they were found to be the basest of scholars and most tyrannical of peoples, for they martyred the Truth and His loved ones throughout all lands. Fie upon them and upon those who followed them without clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Shafi', protect the party of God and His sheep from the wolves of self and passion belonging to the people of the Bayan, that perchance vain imaginings and idle fancies may not this time seize the servants, that all may be illumined with the light of certitude and assurance and fix their gaze upon the horizon of God alone. Say: This is the Day of God, wherein none but He is mentioned, if ye be of them that know. O Shafi', until now the wayward people of the Bayan have failed to comprehend the Day of God and with the utmost cunning and deceit have striven and continue to strive to lead astray the party of God. They have gathered together whatsoever hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. The purpose of those heedless and wayward souls is clear and evident. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things preserved in a mighty Book. Through the power of the Most Great Name, take hold of the reins of souls and adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness in the name of Truth, that the satans and the wayward may witness the lights of steadfastness shining from the brow of each one of the party of God. The cawing of the crows hath been raised from the land of Kaf and Ra, and this is that news which was specifically revealed from the Supreme Pen in Iraq and in the Land of Mystery in the Most Holy Book. Blessed are they that know. Blessed are they that are firmly rooted. Blessed are they that are steadfast. Blessed are they that are firm. Gather together the loved ones of God and impart unto them the Divine Tablet, that all may discover from the fragrance of its utterance that which the tongue is powerless to mention and the pen faileth to describe. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon those whom the signs of the divines have not kept back from God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00971 ===\n\n=== START BH00972 ===\n\nIn the Name of the Nameless Friend!\n\nO Zein, upon whom be the Glory of God! Your letter was received before Us and what was written therein was noted and heard. God willing, may you remain engaged at all times in the remembrance of the Lord of all names. As to what was asked concerning the verse revealed in the Tablet to the kings, it is correct as revealed, with no word omitted. The movement of the Supreme Pen in the fields of Tablets is witnessed in different styles. In one instance, the matter is revealed with brevity - this expression is known as 'easily impossible' - and in another instance, both modes are combined. Therefore in the Surih of Kings the aforementioned verses were mentioned concisely, and this is most eloquent. \"When it is asked, 'For what crime have they imprisoned Him?' they answer, 'Indeed, they desired to renew religion'\" - meaning that if it be asked for what crime and transgression have ye imprisoned the Luminary of creation, they say these people desired to renew religion. From the Most Exalted Source the answer was revealed: If ye choose the ancient and it is preferred by you, why then did ye abandon the previous religions? At the beginning of this verse, \"Say\" is implied, so it would read \"Say: If the ancient is what is chosen...\" etc. And since the meaning of \"Say\" is understood from the utterance of the All-Merciful, it was therefore not mentioned, and this is the manifestation of perfect eloquence. In any case, this verse is not missing anything and is correct. And what you mentioned regarding the other verse, His exalted Word was \"He hath dawned from the horizon of detachment.\"\n\nAs to what you asked about the verse revealed in the Tablet to the Pope, these expressions are allusions to the words of the Son \\[Christ\\] that were mentioned. In one place He says: \"And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" And in another place it is mentioned: \"Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\" From these two passages, the allusion in the words of the Lord of Names in the revealed verse becomes clear. Some statements in certain Tablets refer to previous Books and what was written therein. In these days, Tablets have been specifically revealed for the Zoroastrian people, and what had remained hidden in their books until today has been mentioned. However, until what they possess becomes known, no one will understand the allusions in the revealed verses.\n\nWith regard to what you asked about spirits and their awareness of each other after their ascension, know that the people of Baha who are established in the Crimson Ark consort with each other, associate intimately, gather together, soar, aim for their goals, and ascend as if they were one soul - except that they are the discerning ones, they are the seeing ones, they are the knowing ones. Thus has the matter been decreed from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The people of Baha who dwell in the divine Ark are all aware of each other's conditions and are intimate companions and associates with one another. This station depends on the certitude and deeds of souls. Those souls who are at the same level are aware of each other's qualities, characteristics, ranks and stations. But souls who are below them cannot fully comprehend the levels and stations of those souls who are above them. Each has their portion with your Lord. Blessed is the soul that has turned to God and remained steadfast in His love until its spirit took flight unto God, the King, the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful. As for the spirits of the infidels, by My life, at the time of death they recognize what has passed them by, and they lament and implore. Likewise after their spirits depart from their bodies. It is very clear and evident that after death all will become aware of their deeds and actions. By the Sun of the horizon of might! The people of truth will at that time experience such joy as cannot be described. Similarly, the people of error will be seized by such fear, anxiety and terror as cannot be imagined. How excellent is the state of that soul who has taken and drunk the choice and everlasting wine of faith from the hand of the favors and bounties of the Lord of all religions.\n\nSince a promise was previously made to respond, therefore this brief message is revealed and sent at a time when the clamor of the slanderers is raised and the cry of the heedless has drowned out the sound and echo of thunder. Today the loved ones of God must fix their gaze upon the Manifestation and what appears from Him. Some previous traditions had and have no foundation, and most of what former peoples understood and recorded in their books was according to their own desires, as you have observed that most of what people possess of meanings and interpretations of divine verses has been contrary to truth. Thus after the rending of the veil some things became clear and evident and they acknowledged they had not understood a single word of God's words. The intent is that if God's loved ones would purify their hearts and ears from what they have heard before, and with complete attention fix their gaze upon the Dawning-Place of the Cause and what has appeared from His presence, this would be most loved before God. Despite these afflictions that have befallen and trials that have descended, the Most Exalted Pen has not liked and does not like aught save what speaks the truth: Verily there is no God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. For the fragrance of this word prevents the entry of sorrows, but if one becomes occupied with interpretations of previous words it will aid sorrows. We shall see what God wills and what time requires. For now this much will suffice. Give thanks and be among the grateful ones. Convey My greetings to My loved ones whom God has singled out for His love and made them among the successful ones. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00972 ===\n\n=== START BH00973 ===\n\nIn the name of Him at Whose finger's beckoning the Hour hath come and all who are in the heavens were thunderstruck! This is a Book wherein the Kawthar of life floweth from the hands of the All-Merciful, that He might quicken thereby the peoples of all worlds, that they might turn with their hearts toward the direction of the Beloved and be numbered with the triumphant. Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of these waters which flow from the Finger of Command, and be not of the heedless. Drink ye thereof and tarry not even for a moment, for were We to lift the veil from the face of the Cause, ye would sacrifice your very selves for a single drop thereof. Thus do We make mention in truth, that ye may be of them that know. Say: Through one drop thereof were the realities of the Concourse on High attracted, and through another drop the Lote-Tree of the Furthermost Boundary was raised up, then through yet another drop did the Dove of Eternity warble in the paradise of God, the Omnipotent, the Most High, the Most Great - through this remembrance whereby all remembrances were originated, trees yielded their fruits, rivers flowed, and rain descended from clouds of transcendent glory.\n\nSay: O people! We forewarned you in the Tablets of the days wherein souls would be agitated, the sun darkened, the moon eclipsed, the stars would fall, and the tribes of the earth would lament - days We designated as the days of tribulation, were ye to hearken. Yet when they came and therein appeared what was destined to appear, agitation seized you such that the Dove of Remembrance trembled in your breasts, and ye were among the fearful. Say: Do ye not desire to sacrifice your bodies in the path of God, your Lord, that God might make you sovereign in the kingdoms of the Spirit, that ye might soar on holy wings in the kingdom of My names and the empire of My perpetuity, and enter the pavilion of grandeur - the spot wherein My countenance hath been illumined with tremendous lights?\n\nSay: We made mention of the year of tribulation in the Tablets only to forewarn you thereof and to strengthen you in the Cause of God at its appearance, yet ye were heedless of it and were among the slumberers. Say: We have sent down in the Book the decree of all things, yet none knoweth it save those endowed with penetrating vision.\n\nO servant who art mentioned before the Throne! Know thou that the tablets of fire have been spread throughout all regions, yet thou, leave them behind thee and say: The Word of God is greater than whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and the earth. We have found it sufficient, independent of all worlds. Through it every tongue speaketh, every sick one is healed, every ailing one is cured, through it the ocean of knowledge surgeth in the hearts of them that are near unto God, and through it God distinguisheth between the people of Baha and the companions of hatred and transgression, sending forth holy fragrances upon the sincere ones. When the idolaters gather there, fear them not, but scatter them through My Name, the Omnipotent, the Powerful. Say: O people! This is 'Ali in your midst, speaking truth and calling you to the Supreme Horizon. Beware lest ye oppose him, for ye were created for his own self, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nSay: The Primal Point desired naught but what I desire, and I desire naught but what He desired, and that which hath appeared through Me is the beloved of His heart, if ye be of them that know. Say: He is present before the Throne and weepeth for what hath befallen Me at the hands of the people of the Bayan who recite His verses, then slay His Beloved, and are not ashamed before His luminous countenance. Say: O people, judge ye fairly by God - by what proof did ye believe in Him, and by what evidence do ye now deny God, the Lord of all worlds? Verily, from the right hand of the Throne He crieth out, saying: \"O people! Did ye not witness that in My days I made mention of My Beloved's name, spoke in praise of His Self, recalled the wonders of His remembrance, and heralded His glorious and wondrous Beauty? Have ye not seen how I sacrificed My life in His path? By God! When My blood was spilled upon the earth, there was traced therefrom the mention of His exalted and noble Name. Have ye not read what was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen upon the tablets of eternity in remembrance of this Beauty through Whose manifestation the Hidden Mystery was revealed? Blessed be God, the Best of creators!\"\n\nThat paradise wherein the breezes of His love blow not hath ceased to exist, and that earth wherein the trees of His remembrance are not planted hath sunk low, and those feet that walk not upon the path of Him Who hath appeared between the heavens and the earth have stumbled. Verily, I made the Bayan and all that was revealed therein as but a leaf from the leaves of Paradise to be present before Him, and thus was the Command revealed in the Bayan, and ye were among the witnesses. And I took from all who believed in God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Invincible, the covenant of His Self. Yet when He appeared in truth, ye denied Him and allied yourselves with those who sought to shed His blood. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people!\n\nFear ye God and look not upon Him with your eyes but with His eye. This is what ye were commanded in the Tablets, and to this testify My Self and, beyond Me, His Self, the Protector, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Therefore, hear My words, O My servants: if ye believe not in Him, oppose Him not. Have mercy upon Him through Whose will appeared the command of the Kaf and the Nun in the tablets of glory well-preserved. The denizens of the Supreme Paradise weep while ye rejoice within yourselves, and the pillars of the Throne have quaked at your deeds, yet ye remain heedless and are among the most lost people. Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in this Paradise, that perchance the people may become aware within themselves and not be among the heedless.\n\nAnd thou, O servant, hearken unto the call of thy Lord, then detach thyself from all that hath been created between earth and heaven. Then summon the people unto this Cause through which the sun of the Bayan hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's will, the Mighty, the Bountiful, and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed in this Paradise which hath appeared in the name of God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Wise. Beware lest anything prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord. Stand thou firm in the Cause with steadfastness from Us, and fear not the hosts of the polytheists. Immerse thyself in this Most Great Ocean that thou mayest discover what lieth hidden therein of the pearls of thy Lord's remembrance, the Mighty, the Generous. Strip not thy head of the crown of faithfulness, nor thy temple of the Most Glorious adorning, nor thy heart of the Kawthar of eternity, nor thy tongue of My wondrous and glorious remembrance. O Tree of humanity! Be thou enkindled by this Fire that hath been lit in the heart of this Paradise, that through thee may be ignited the hearts of Our seeking servants. Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act thou according to what thou hast been commanded, by Our decree, for this is better for thee than the kingdoms of the heavens and earth. And the Spirit and glory be upon thee and upon God's sincere servants.\n\n=== END BH00973 ===\n\n=== START BH00974 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!\n\nO Name of Bounty! The Lord of existence is seen beneath the claws of hatred. Nevertheless, We desire to make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Kazim - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - that the attraction of remembrance may draw him to a station from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of God's favor, the Lord of all worlds. This is the Day wherein the Mother Book speaketh, yet the people are heedless. They have denied the bounty of the Utterance and have committed that which hath caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise in the highest heaven to lament - a station which none knoweth save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Kazim! Upon thee be My glory! Hear in the Persian tongue: Thy mention hath ever been before the Wronged One, and the gaze of loving-kindness hath been directed towards thee. There befell Us what hath befallen Us. I swear by the ocean of utterance, had We not borne hardships in God's path, His Cause would have remained behind a veil. Fire in His path is light, and tribulation in His love is rest - nay, He is the Master of all mercies and the Sovereign of all comfort. Some time ago thou didst mention those who journeyed from the Land of Sad to that land. It was observed. Say: O my handmaiden, praise the Desired One of all worlds that thou hast been honored by His mention and distinguished by His favor. The Glory be upon thee from Us, and upon those with thee, and upon every maidservant who hath turned and believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We send greetings to the handmaidens of that land who have quaffed the choice wine and turned unto the Most Glorious Horizon, and We give them glad tidings of God's grace, kindness and mercy.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward the lights of Thy countenance and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by that which is in Thy knowledge and ordained in Thy mighty Book to strengthen me in steadfastness unto this manifest Cause. Then I implore Thee, O God of all contingent beings and desire of all things existent, by the Word through which the ocean of knowledge surged in all creation and the sun of certitude shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof, to write for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will aid me in Thy remembrance and praise, and ordain for me that which will profit me in Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Thou Who art wronged and O Thou Who art imprisoned in the Most Great Prison! Remember him whose name was present in the Most Great Scene, that he may arise to serve the Cause, detached from all that was and shall be. O Asadu'llah! The Lord of mankind remembereth thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from those who disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed. We were seated upon the thrones and speaking in praise when a new governor arrived in this city which was named with the Most Beautiful Names by the One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. When he was established in \\[the seat of\\] power, he committed that which caused the Concourse on High and the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and said that which caused the hearts of those who circle round God's throne, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, to burn. By God's life! We bore the hardships of the earth out of Our desire to manifest the Cause, but most of the people understand not. Say: Tribulation hath never hindered the Baha. He hath stood before all faces with a power that caused the feet of the mystics and the learned to slip, yet the people understand not. We have appeared and manifested what We desired through Our power, and I am verily the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. If thou findest the fragrance of My utterance, arise and say:\n\nBy Thy glory, O Desire of the world! I find none to remember me who can reach the atmosphere of the glory of Thy oneness. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word and Thy Crimson Ark and the Tablet wherein Thou hast mentioned those who turned with radiant faces toward the Supreme Horizon on this blessed and praiseworthy Day, to protect Thy loved ones from the harm of those who understand not.\n\nO 'Ali! The Countenance of the Ancient Beauty turneth toward thee from His Most Great Prison. Canst thou hear and act upon what the Most Exalted Pen commandeth thee at this moment? Put aside the world in the name of thy Lord and take with the hands of power My perspicuous Book. Neither their books nor their sciences and arts will profit the people except through turning to this Most Great Ocean which surgeth through this manifest Name. What they possess will not profit the world except through My luminous and shining Command. We beseech God to strengthen thee in the greatest steadfastness and aid thee in that which will draw thee nigh unto Him at all times. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have not broken His Covenant and His Testament, who have arisen and declared: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\"\n\n=== END BH00974 ===\n\n=== START BH00975 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!\n\nO Samandar, upon thee be My Baha! The mention of the loved ones of that land hath ever been and continueth to be before the Most Holy Court, and from the Most Great Ocean there floweth forth unto each one a gulf of bounty, and the rain of mercy descendeth. The letter of Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory of God, which he wrote to thee, was presented before the face of this Wronged One, and the servant present submitted it all. We heard his call and beheld his deeds. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAccording to what was mentioned, the deniers among the people of the Bayan have said that the people of Baha speak unseemly words regarding the martyrs and His Holiness the Proof - upon them be all the most glorious glory and all the most luminous light - and that they do not accept the Bayan. This is naught but a mighty calumny. That which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen specifically regarding the martyrs is without peer or equal. For each one, a specific tribute hath flowed from the Ancient Pen. The Tablets of Visitation exist - every letter thereof testifieth to the grace, bounty, kindness and mercy of God, exalted be His glory. These heedless souls have, through such calumnies, prevented the hapless servants from the Truth, just as previous factions prevented people from the Lord of all beings through vain imaginings. On the Day of Judgment, imaginary cities and false claims appeared as swords, and there befell the Lord of the world that which caused the atoms of creation to weep.\n\nI bear witness to this, as doth every discerning and enlightened soul. Neither the opposition of the world, nor the clamor of the nations, nor the tyranny of the oppressors, nor the injustice of the wayward, could deter Him from God's Cause. When the Cause was made manifest, the idolaters and the worshippers of vain imaginings emerged from behind their veils and, with swords of hatred, sought to assail the Lord of all worlds. Say: Where were ye when the limbs of the world trembled with fear of those days, and where were ye when the Wronged One lay bound in chains and fetters? One who was counted among the servants arose, through the instigation of certain idolaters, to oppose the Cause, and by his vain imaginings deprived the weak ones of the earth from the Most Exalted Summit, the Ultimate Goal, and the Supreme Horizon. Seventy souls were present on this journey and witnessed with their own eyes how that deluded one was unable to utter a word in the presence of God. We beseech God not to deprive hearts and souls of the light of truth. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nO Husayn! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books, in spite of those who denied God and His signs, and turned away from Him Whom they were wont to invoke by night and by day. Well is it with thee, and blessed art thou. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! All praise be to Thee for having taught me, and made me to know, and shown me, and caused me to hear, and guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty Cause. I beseech Thee by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge, O Lord of all being, to assist Thy servants to rend asunder the veils that have hindered them from turning towards Thee and drawing nigh unto the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy testimonies and the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Repository of Thy knowledge. O God of the world and Desire of the nations! I have turned toward Thee, holding fast to Thy sure handle and clinging to the hem of Thy bounty, O Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. I beseech Thee to aid Thy servants in that which Thou lovest and approvest. O Lord! Withhold them not from the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness, nor from the fruits of the Tree of Thy Cause. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the One in Whose grasp lie the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.\n\nThe Most Exalted Pen counseleth all on this dark night to wisdom and forbearance with the peoples of the earth, both learned and ignorant. Move with love, and with utmost joy and radiance set forth the revealed verses and manifest proofs. Today the helper of the Cause is the fear of God, and Its hosts are goodly deeds and virtuous character. The splendors shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My friends and loved ones who were not deterred by the clamor of the heedless nor the croaking of the croakers. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00975 ===\n\n=== START BH00976 ===\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful Herald!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath manifested that which was hidden in the eternity of eternities and concealed from all eyes and sight. When He desired to reveal His grace that encompasseth all created things and to manifest His mercy that precedeth all contingent beings, He spoke the Supreme Word whereby the Herald called out from every direction: \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Possessor of all names and attributes!\"\n\nPraise be to God Who revealed Himself through His glorious Name unto the world. Then all created things turned toward the Most Great Ocean, each drop of which \\[announceth\\] to the servants the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai and the Dawning-Place of the Light that hath shone and gleamed from the horizon of God's will, the Revealer of verses.\n\nPraise be to God Who hath made death a door to His presence, a means of attaining His reunion, and a cause for the life of His servants. Through it He hath revealed the mysteries of His Book and that which was treasured in His knowledge. Verily, He is the Almighty Whom the tyranny of the oppressors hath not weakened, nor have the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings \\[hindered\\].\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is the Dawning-Place of His glory, the Dayspring of His beauty, the Manifestation of His mysteries, the Revealer of His verses, and the Proclaimer of His evidences. He it is at Whose appearance before the faces of the world the limbs of the nations trembled and the ocean of His Most Great Name surged. Through Him the Supreme Pen moved and revealed its hidden pearls and treasured gems. Through Him the veils were rent asunder, the hearts of those endowed with understanding were set ablaze in their final abode, and all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom and Dominion, then Glory and Power belong to God, the Lord of Lords and the Commander on the Day of Reckoning!\"\n\nWith Him was a company from among the breezes of revelation and a host from among the Manifestations of God's names and the Dawning-places of His attributes, while before His face the banner of detachment was unfurled. Then from the fragrances of His love and the sweet-scented breezes of His detachment there spread abroad that which transformed conditions in the Most Exalted Station and the most sublime ranks, in such wise as cannot be expressed in words. Thus did the ocean of utterance surge in mention of him who was named Muhammad-'Ali in the Most Holy, Most Luminous Tablet. By My life! Through him the light of the Cause shone forth and the breeze of grace wafted, and the Spirit of the Cause proclaimed before his face: \"This is he who hath not broken God's Covenant and Testament, and this is he to whose steadfastness the Tongue of the All-Glorious God hath testified in the Supreme Horizon.\" The atoms themselves have borne witness to his acceptance, his turning unto God, and his spending that which he possessed in the path of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO Samandari! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. The Pen desireth not to make mention in this most grievous calamity of aught save that which may attract the hearts of men, such that the greatest joy may take hold of all people through mercy, kindness and bounty from God unto those who have uttered His praise and have attained to the reading of that which was sent down concerning his remembrance from the heaven of the bounty of the All-Bountiful. May the resplendent light that shineth and the radiant glory that dawneth from the horizon of the heaven of bounty be upon him, upon his family and his kindred, and upon those who have hearkened to his call and his mention in this News, at whose appearance all things, and the Manifestations of the Names, and the Dawning-places of Revelation in the kingdom of creation have spoken. Glory and majesty belong unto God, the Lord of all men, Who speaketh before the faces of the parties.\n\nO Samandar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Since his eminence mentioned this word in his testament - Glory be to God! Generally when anyone heareth mention of death, sorrow and dejection appear upon him, yet this lowliest of servants is gladdened by its mention and made joyous by its thought. And in another place: Although at my death friends will be sorrowful and enemies will rejoice, yet since I myself am joyful, let the friends be joyful too. Thus were the gates of mentioning tribulation, whereby the hearts of creatures are troubled, shut fast.\n\nSay: Glory be to Thee, O God, O Rapture of the hearts of those near unto Thee and Light of the hearts of the sincere! Thou seest Thy lovers taking their spirits in their hands, and Thy yearning ones their heads in their palms, awaiting Thy glorious and wondrous meeting, through which the breezes of life have wafted throughout creation. O Lord! Draw them nigh unto Thee, then grant them to drink of the water of Thy reunion at all times. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.\n\nAnd at this time We conclude Our utterance with the mention of him who hath ascended unto Us, and We say: My fragrances, My remembrance and My praise be upon thee and upon those whom neither hatred hath prevented from his remembrance nor the veils of heedlessness from his praise. It behooveth every soul to remember him as My Most Exalted Pen hath remembered him in this most mighty, most holy, most luminous, most glorious station.\n\n=== END BH00976 ===\n\n=== START BH00977 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to God Who created the Point and appointed for it four pillars, and brought forth from the first pillar an Alif which spoke of its own self and circled round it, being the mirror reflecting it in the station of Oneness, wherein the unitarians profess His unity, the sincere ones glorify Him, and those nigh unto God proclaim that He is God, there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the One. And from its second pillar He manifested that same Form in another station, and shed upon it the lights shining forth from His Most Great Horizon, whereupon it called out, turned towards Him, arose in the station of multiplicity, and proclaimed that verily there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Thus did all things appear and all names become distinct. And from its third pillar He brought forth another Alif and made it the Dawning-Place of His most exalted attributes, and it proclaimed that verily there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And from its fourth pillar He manifested that which reflected the first, third and second pillars, and it proclaimed in this station that He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Peerless.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Knower of all knowledge! Hearts and minds are bewildered in seeking to comprehend the pillars of the Point which was created by Thy command and brought into being by Thy will. How can anyone soar into the atmosphere of the knowledge of Thy Self or ascend to a station which those nigh unto Thee among Thy creatures and the sincere ones among Thy servants are powerless to comprehend? I testify that Thou art not known through attributes nor remembered through names. Thou hast ever been exalted above whatsoever may occur to the minds of Thy chosen ones and sanctified from all that may be heard or seen in Thy realm. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to accept from us whatsoever may appear in Thy love as a token of Thy grace, and to hear from us that which our tongues may utter as a sign of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Munificent, the Generous.\n\nMy soul be a sacrifice for your love! The servant hath been honored by your noble letter and your exalted words, from which the fragrance of your love was wafted to all regions and by which the hearts of lovers were set ablaze on this Day of Meeting. Joy hath so overtaken me that it cannot be described in writing. I beseech God to reward you with the most excellent of rewards, for verily He is the Rewarder, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nFurthermore, it is submitted that a year or less before the arrival of Shaykh Salman, he forwarded to the Most Holy Court such petitions from the loved ones as were in his possession, and for all that was received, replies were revealed from the Dayspring of favors and were dispatched. God willing, may all attain unto them and be illumined by their light, and be set ablaze by the fire of divine love that is enkindled in the words revealed in these blessed pages, and become firm and steadfast in the love of God in such wise that they may cause the people of the world to be set ablaze.\n\nAnd furthermore, what was with the honored Shaykh arrived, except for the rice. The honored Shaykh (may the Glory of God rest upon him) - Shaykh Salman himself will present the details of this matter. However, I give him the glad tidings that before Shaykh Salman's arrival, a Tablet specifically for him was revealed from the heaven of divine Will, and in that Tablet mention was made accepting what they had sent. Well is it with him! This servant conveys greetings to him, and likewise the funds from the honored Aqa Muhammad Husayn and what Aqa 'Ali-Akbar (upon them be the Glory of God) had sent all arrived, and this evanescent servant sends infinite greetings to each of them. I beseech God to strengthen them at all times. It is well known and evident that all that exists in the world will soon perish and vanish. Blessed are they whom the opposition of the divines and the objections of the jurisprudents - that is, the ignorant ones - have not prevented from the manifest horizon and the straight path, and who have turned with complete certitude and assurance to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Their mention shall endure in the Book of God as long as His earthly and heavenly kingdom endures - a bounty that cannot be compared with any other bounty and whose description the Pen of creation is utterly powerless to render. Today is the Lord of Days, and whatever appears in it is reckoned among the most excellent of deeds. Blessed are they who have attained the recognition of God in His days and have arisen to mention and praise Him. Although there was much delay in responding to the petitions of the loved ones - nearly two years passed as Shaykh Salman's arrival was delayed - yet response was sent to all, living and deceased, for repeatedly was this word heard from the Most Holy Tongue that the living and deceased loved ones of God have one station in the Most Great View: \"We address them in their death as We address them in their life.\" Furthermore, the rice that your honor had given to the honored Trustee (upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds) arrived. Moreover, mention of the prisoners of that land has ever been made in the Most Holy Court. Blessed are they who assisted them in their life and remember them after their ascension. I beseech God to enable all the loved ones to act with the wisdom that hath been revealed in the Tablets. Had they acted upon what was revealed until now, most of the people of the earth would have turned to the horizon of the Cause. God willing, may all be focused on what God hath desired. Some time ago, through Shaykh Salman, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet specifically for your honor was revealed and sent, and likewise in this instance, the last Tablet was given to his honor, the Name of God M.H. (upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God) to forward. Praise be to God, perfect bounty from the horizon of grace is shining upon your honor. All those circumambulating send greetings to your honor. The Glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you. This petition was to be dispatched to your presence in the company of Shaykh Salman, but due to numerous occupations it was delayed and sent from elsewhere. We beseech God to honor him with your presence. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThe Servant\n\n66 \\[of God\\]\n\n11 Rajab 1292\n\n=== END BH00977 ===\n\n=== START BH00978 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nPraise be to Him Who hath, through a word proceeding from Him, become the Sovereign of the world and hath adorned it with the ornament of His names and attributes, that all may testify that verily He is God, there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been supreme over His creation and powerful over His dominion. He is the Single One, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Praise be to God Who hath forbidden His servants to dispose of His possessions without His leave. Should He permit anyone to do as he pleaseth for a time, this would be but a token of His wisdom that encompasseth all created things. He is indeed established upon the throne. He heareth and seeth. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Praise be to God unto Whose greatness and sovereignty all things have testified. He is the One Whose mercy hath preceded His servants. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. The horizons have been flooded with the light of the Sun of His bounty, and the world hath been illumined by the radiance of His grace which hath encompassed both the seen and the unseen. I offer praise, salutation and glory unto those whom neither fear nor perturbation have deterred from God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. These are they who are the people of truth amidst mankind. Whoso gazeth upon their countenances perceiveth the freshness of the All-Merciful, and findeth their hearts firmer than mountains in the Cause of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nThereafter, the horizon of this servant's heart hath been illumined by the dawning of the Sun of your remembrance, O Thou Who art our Beloved and the Beloved of the world, our Goal and the Goal of the nations. Blessed be your heart through which flow and have flowed the rivers of the All-Merciful's love throughout all possibility. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to unite us and to grant us from the heaven of His bounty that which befitteth His greatness and sovereignty. He is indeed the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nAs to what ye wrote concerning the daughter of him who hath ascended unto God, it hath been presented before the Countenance. He hath said, and His word is the truth: It is not for her to turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon, but she may choose one from among those who have quaffed the wine of recognition and have attained the lights of the Countenance when all in creation turned away from it. Those who have made arrangements and wished to arrange the means of her journey, their reward is with God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We glorify their faces from this station and counsel them to fear God and to do that which befitteth His Cause that dominateth all who are in earth and heaven.\n\nAs to what ye mentioned regarding the House, He hath said, and His word is the most sweet: No one should speak concerning it. Its owner hath suffered that which is greater than what befell it, as testified by the Mother Book which is with Him. We have spent all that we possessed in the path of God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. He who hath disposed and disposeth of it without My leave hath indeed been heedless of My remembrance. We beseech God, exalted be He, to grant him success in returning. He is verily the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His Name, the Supreme over all possibility. Say: O My loved ones! Blessed are ye for having attained unto the remembrance and praise of God. Rejoice with exceeding joy, then give thanks to Him by night and day. Grieve not over what hath befallen the House. Be patient, for He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Patient. Consider what hath befallen the Wronged One when He was in the hands of His enemies, then remember the afflictions that encompassed Him from all directions. Thus doth the Prisoner speak. He hath in all conditions placed His trust in the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nAs to what ye mentioned concerning Haji Muhammad and his wife, it hath been presented before the Countenance. The Beloved hath said: She should follow her husband in what is right. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book.\n\n\\[...\\] And as for what they desired regarding permission for the blessed place - this was presented and the sun of permission has dawned from the horizon of utterance. I beseech God the Exalted to aid them and us in that which unifies hearts and through which the remembrance of God is exalted among His servants. And concerning what you mentioned about Jenab-i-Nasir, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]: excellent is what he has done and he has heeded what was commanded of him. I beseech God the Exalted to send down upon him blessings from the heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the Generous Giver.\n\nO my beloved and the beloved of my heart! It behooveth the people of Zawra to conceal what is sent to them, for most people are heedless and contentious. None should object regarding the letter Mim and Vav, and the loved ones should hold fast to what they were previously commanded concerning him. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is indeed the Kind, the Generous. They must maintain silence regarding him and remain calm and quiet about what proceedeth from him. Verily He doth not allow to be lost the reward of one who hath arisen to serve Him and hath spoken His praise - to this every discerning soul doth testify. Your honor should counsel the people of Iraq to patience, calmness and pure wisdom, lest there be raised the clamor of those who have taken good for evil, who have considered justice to be tyranny and oppression, and reformation to be corruption. Would that they had known and understood what their Kind and Trustworthy Lord desired for them. We beseech your honor to convey my greetings to the faces of God's loved ones in those parts. I ask Him, exalted be He, to ordain for them the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThen there reached the Servant a letter from Jenab-i-Muhammad-Ibrahim, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. He had previously written a letter to the Servant and desired to attain Our presence, but the command was issued to prevent it. I ask the Beloved to aid him in what He loveth and is pleased with. He is among those who have attained the presence time after time, again and again. He should hold fast in the Cause of his Lord to what he was commanded. In truth, he has attained the presence and drunk the choice wine of reunion, cup after cup, chalice after chalice. Today, after having attained what he has attained, it behooveth him to hold fast to that which will cause the Cause of God to be exalted, through the wisdom which the Most Merciful hath revealed in the Tablets. The Servant conveyeth his greetings to him and to both \\[of them\\] and to the faces of those who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords. I hope that your honor will convey my greetings and my sincerity to him, and what I have written in his name, that he may rejoice in God's grace and mercy and act according to what hath been commanded by the Wise Ordainer.

We praise and thank Him for having made known unto us His path and for having taught us that which was hidden from all who dwell on earth. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful Who desired to quicken the world through His Most Great Name. Yet when He came with the Kingdom of Utterance amongst the peoples, every heedless one turned away, every ignorant one waxed proud, and every learned one objected, save those whom the veils of names withheld not from the Creator of heaven, and whom the cawing of the crows drove not away from the Most Exalted Horizon. These arose and stood firm in service to the Cause, giving voice to the praise of their Creator and Fashioner amidst all peoples. These are honored servants upon whom no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they, for having fulfilled their covenant and their pledge, for having cast behind them the books of idle fancies and taken hold of the Book of God, the Sovereign, the Just, the True, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd then, your letter reached Me, and when I had read and learned of its contents, I repaired to the station and laid it before the face of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful throughout all creation. He spoke, exalted be His majesty and magnificent be His sovereignty: O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! There hath come before the Wronged One that which thou didst send in the name of My servant who is present, and We have learned what was contained therein. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is the face that hath turned unto His Face, and the heart that hath turned towards Him, and the tongue that hath spoken His beauteous praise. Bear thou witness to that which God did testify before the creation of the heavens and earth - that there is none other God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Give thanks for His having aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His signs and the Dayspring of His Cause, when every renowned scholar remained heedless thereof. The grace is in His hands - He singleth out whom He willeth through His command. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancies and taken hold of the Book of God with clear certitude. Act thou in accordance with that which hath been enjoined upon thee by God - this is better for thee than all that hath been created in the heavens and earths. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. God will soon manifest the stations of His loved ones on earth. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Hold thou fast to the hem of the robe of thy Lord's grace, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest riches hold thee back from the ultimate goal, or earthly concerns grieve thee on this Day wherein the ocean of joy and gladness hath surged in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Kings and subjects, rich and poor, shall all perish, but that which hath been sent down unto thee from the kingdom of thy Lord, the Kind, the Merciful, shall endure. God willing, may ye speak, purified from worldly things, in remembrance of the Lord of Names, and be turned towards His horizon. These are the final days - strive ye to attain the divine bounties. Praise be to God that ye have heard His call and turned towards His horizon. Now must ye hold fast to the cord of steadfastness, for mighty indeed is this Cause. At all times take refuge with the True One, that He may protect you from the harm of the barking ones, the opposers, and the deniers. The barking hath been raised and shall continue to be raised. We have informed all of this beforehand. Verily He loveth His loved ones and hath informed them beforehand of all that hath appeared from afar and shall appear hereafter. Should anyone come unto you with the book of the nethermost depths, leave him behind you and place your trust in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, the loved ones of God must be observed to be so steadfast that all who dwell on earth shall be powerless to prevent them. We counsel you to manifest supreme steadfastness and that whereby the Cause of God is exalted between earth and heaven. He, verily, is the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing. Today the Cause must be assisted through deeds and goodly character. By the life of God! Goodly deeds and praiseworthy character are sharper than swords and more penetrating than the essence of steel. By these two must ye render assistance. Thus doth God counsel you as a favor from Him. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus ends the blessed verses that have been sent down. The favor of God is manifest and evident. God willing, may ye ever gaze towards His horizon and attain His grace. By the life of God! This is the Day of mention and utterance. Blessed are they that attain.\n\nConcerning your questions about Huququ'llah and endowed properties: endowments revert to the Truth, as hath been revealed in the Book of God. However, in view of the wisdom which all are commanded to observe today, such funds should be spent on the same purposes as before, lest the clamor of the heedless be raised. As for Huququ'llah, it is the source of blessing and the manifestation of bounty and loving-kindness for the servants. He, verily, is independent of what hath been and what shall be. Until two years ago, the matter of Huquq was concealed, and even after it was revealed, this was due to grace. Should anyone be enabled to act in accordance with what hath been revealed in the Most Holy Book, this would assuredly be best, most exalted and most befitting for him. This ordinance is binding when possible. He, verily, speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about your parents and brother, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. Praise be to God, they were adorned with the ornament of divine mercy. Mention of your sister was also made at the Most Exalted Presence. His word, exalted be His grandeur: \"God willing, may they act in accordance with what God loveth and speak that which He desireth.\" This station is most lofty. Blessed is he who attaineth unto it, and blessed is he who drinketh from the ocean of the utterance of his Lord, the Generous, the Bestower.\n\nThis servant's humble request is that you convey to the friends in that land mentions of glorification, praise and the sincerity of this evanescent servant.

Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the Ancient Scene, the seat of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. O thou who art the remnant of what was left of the family of Husayn in the land of ?aff! Arise to promote the Cause between the heavens and the earths, then let the herald call out that he may summon the servants in these grievous days to the Manifestation of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Verily, those who today are veiled in heedlessness - these have forgotten the remembrance of their Lord, and their souls have suggested to them a course of action, but thy Lord, the Help in Peril, is independent of them and of all created things. Say: O people! Fear God and deny not Him through Whom every wise command hath been made manifest, and unto Whom the Cause shall return in the hereafter and the former times - a promise binding upon Us; verily We are they who cause all to return. And whoso is not detached today from all things shall never be able to enter the Kingdom of God, thy Lord. Thus hath the command been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: O people! Follow that which hath been revealed in the Book and be not of the ignorant. Purify yourselves through the remembrance of God and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Say: By God! We have sanctified Our soul from all things and have veiled Our countenance from the gaze of all peoples, and were silent from all remembrances and from every new remembrance, and We witnessed that the people were veiled from the Cause of God, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing. And there was none to remind the people and draw them nigh unto Paradise and guide them to the path of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Thereupon We arose to promote the Cause and manifested the Face with clear sovereignty until the Cause reached the East of the earth and its West, and the power of God was made manifest and encompassed all peoples, and the hearts of the troubled were set at rest, and the sun of assurance shone forth from the horizon of might with manifest and glorious lights. \\[...\\]\n\nO My loved ones! Nothing has profited them, nor will anything ever profit them, and they are at this hour in manifest loss. Say: O people! Turn unto God Who created you and fashioned you and sent down unto you the Tablets of His Cause through His messengers, that they might give you glad tidings of the paradise of His mercy and convey unto you that which would draw you nigh unto a most exalted and holy seat. When the days were fulfilled unto this Day, then did He manifest Me in truth and send Me unto you with all the signs, were ye of those who recognize. And among the people are those who say that naught hath passed of God's days save a numbered few and certain known years, and therefore it behooveth not that anyone should appear. Thus have they limited God's Cause by their own limitations, even as did those before them, and were among the idolators. They say what the people of the Furqan said when God came in the temple of His name, the Most High, the Most Great. These have left not a letter of what was uttered by the people of the Furqan; nay, We find them more veiled than the peoples of old, as ye would testify were ye among those who ponder the verses of God and what issueth from their mouths. Such as these have denied all God's bounties and have made His signs into fragments. Thus do We recount unto thee the tale of the idolators, then do We expound unto thee the tale of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: O people! Judge fairly within your own selves which of the two parties is nearer unto God and His way. Set forth, O concourse of the Bayanis! And thou, turn aside from those who have openly denied God, even though thine eyes \\[behold them\\]. Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful commanded thee when He was encompassed by sorrows from the manifestations of Satan and was in evident grief. By God, O thou who art assured in God! When the deniers witnessed that the verses had been sent down from the heaven of Command and had encompassed the worlds, they arose to slay Me. When the hosts of victory descended and God preserved Me from their evil, they arose with another plot through what Satan had whispered in their hearts, and thus was the matter, wert thou of them that hear. They fabricated against Me that which beseemed their own selves and attributed unto Me that which their own souls and hands had committed, that they might cast the fetters of the Youth into the hearts of the unitarians. By God, the Truth! Whoso hath drunk from this cup will never turn unto all who are in the heavens and the earth and will be independent of all the worlds. Thus have We expounded the matter unto thee and bestowed upon thee yet another favor that thou mightest thank God, thy Lord, and be of the thankful ones. And the mercy that hath no beginning and no end be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon those who hearken unto thy words concerning God, thy Lord and their Lord and the Lord of all creation.\n\n=== END BH00980 ===\n\n=== START BH00981 ===\n\nHe is God - Exalted be His Station, to Him belong Greatness and Glory\n\nThis evanescent servant, whenever he attempts to offer praise and thanksgiving, it is as though he hears from all his limbs and members the cry \"it cannot draw nigh unto me, for God hath placed it beyond the comprehension of all creation.\" And when he turns away and sets down pen and paper, it is as though spirit, heart and soul cry out: \"O heedless one! Art thou in despair, even though thou hast heard from the Tongue of Grandeur 'Despair not of God's mercy'?\" He stands between light and fire - His light \\[...\\] and His fire strikes fear, yet this servant circumambulates both, for the light is a gleam from the effulgences of the Sun of His Countenance, and the fire is a flame from the burning of the Tree of Grace. Glory be to God! The Ocean of Life surgeth, and the horizon of grace and bounty is manifest, evident, dawning and resplendent. Nevertheless, all are heedless of Him save whom God willeth. In the Qur'an the All-Merciful saith: \"None shall touch it save the purified ones.\" Now this evanescent servant declareth concerning the manifestations of grace which \"none behold save those who are brought nigh\": O my God, O Thou the Generous One! Thy Name of the Beloved hath attracted the world, and Thy Name of Bounty hath adorned the nations with the ornament of prosperity. The people of the world, despite their heedlessness and ignorance, seek the wonders of Thy grace, and the wayfarers, despite their weakness and poverty, are in search of the gems of Thy bounty. Thou art He the rejection of Whose grace by the ungrateful hath not withheld the rain of Thy mercy and bounty, and the ignorance of Whose servants hath not concealed the manifestations of Thy knowledge. The swords of princes and the chains of the mighty have not prevented Thee from Thy purpose. Thine is the power and the strength, and Thine is the might and the choice. I beseech Thee to adorn Thy faithful servant, who is designated by the name of Hasan, with the lights of Thy Most Great Name amongst the world and the nations. O Generous One! Through Thy conquering power and Thy prevailing might, preserve him from the evil of the heedless and idolatrous souls. Make manifest in his heart the light of steadfastness and kindle in his being the fire of love, that he may be wholly occupied with Thee, in such wise that his name may be exalted under the shadow of Thy Name and his station may be elevated beneath the canopy of Thy station. Thine is the bounty and the generosity, and Thine is the grace and the bestowal, O Thou the Bestower of favors! Thy grace took his hand and delivered him from the doubts and vain imaginings of men. Verily, this servant hath laid hold on the hem of Thy bounty and the cords of Thy generosity and favors, that Thou mayest make him a servant of Thy Cause, standing firm in Thy service, and speaking forth Thy praise and glorification with wisdom and eloquence. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all religions and the Ruler of all existence.\n\nThereafter, this evanescent one, after reading 'Ali's letter and reviewing it, turned his attention until that which was in the letter was presented before the presence of the Countenance. He said: Praise be to God! Through the confirmations of the Blessed One they have attained, and by the radiant lights of the Sun of divine knowledge they are illumined and adorned. All the peoples of the world count themselves among the faithful and assured, yet when the test came and the light of recognition shone forth from the direction of Mecca, all the divines - whether idol-worshippers, Jews, or Christians - arose in opposition, though that Holy Being called all to the word of unity. Glory be to God! The ears of the polytheists were deprived of His call and the eyes of the heedless were prevented from beholding the splendors of His beauty. Finally they issued the decree for His death and arose with utmost hatred and malice to shed His most pure blood. The more they opposed, the more manifest became the light of His Cause, and the more complete their objections, the more intense grew the fire of His Cause. His is the command and the creation, His the grandeur and the majesty. Verily He is the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens.\n\nThe servant present read thy letter. Praise be to God, the fragrance of steadfastness and the sweet-scented breeze of love were inhaled therefrom. We beseech God to ordain for thee the good of this world and the next, and to exalt thee through His Name in the kingdom of creation. There is no God but Him, the Omnipotent over His will. Within His grasp lie the reins of all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and in His right hand are all who abide in the dominion of command and creation. He is the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.\n\nHis is the praise and the bounty, His the majesty and the grandeur. He is the King Who has honored His loved ones at all times with mention and utterance among all possibilities. He deposited the seed of divine knowledge in the soil of hearts through His hands of mercy and watered it with the rains of His grace. Praise be to God, it has sprouted forth in such wise that neither the poisons of the world can harm it nor the afflictions of the nations can alter it. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThis servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee to promote the Word with wisdom and utterance and to become the cause of spreading divine knowledge in those regions. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. I convey greetings of peace to the friends in that land. It is hoped they will recognize the worth and station of this time, will in all conditions drink from the cup of bounty, and will gaze toward the highest horizon. Praise be to God, the lights of the Sun of favor are shining and the ocean of grace is surging. Blessed are they who in this transient world acquire an everlasting station. This servant is occupied with the remembrance of the friends in the nights and days. God willing, may all hold fast with utmost strength, power and assurance to the cord of the favor of the Lord of religions. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThe sweets that were sent arrived. In truth, the fragrance of love wafted from them all and the palate of God's loved ones was sweetened thereby. After they were presented in the Most Holy Court, they were accepted and with a smile it was said: \"They arrived at a good time.\" According to command, some were distributed and some preserved so that others might gradually partake thereof. Peace be upon you and upon those with you and upon God's righteous servants.

We have heretofore spoken in eloquent language that which betokened pure grace and everlasting remembrance. Now We speak in the language of light that it may draw thee to the Dawning-Place of thy Lord's grace, the All-Informed Speaker. By the life of God! From the earliest days until now, by night and by day, the Pen of counsel hath been in motion, and in the first rank and station Its purpose hath been naught but to quench the fire of hatred and rancor which blazeth in the hearts and breasts of the diverse peoples of the world. Thou art well aware of the differences among the people. We have forbidden conflict, corruption and strife, and have commanded all to that which giveth rise to justice, equity, refinement and grace. God the All-Knowing beareth witness that We have had no purpose for Ourselves, and the tribulations We have suffered in this path are beyond reckoning. Every fair-minded soul hath testified and doth testify to this. Neither the opposition of the divines, nor the might of the powerful, nor the sovereignty of rulers did deter this servant. Were the possessors of majesty, wealth, bounty and glory to ponder, even briefly, upon that which hath been mentioned before and after, all would hasten toward the ocean of divine generosity, and would find themselves purified and sanctified from the dust of idle fancies and the darkness of vain imaginings of men, and would utter the blessed words \"Now hath the truth become manifest.\"\n\nThis Wronged One hath spoken only for the sake of God, and thus did We acquaint all kings and cities of the world with that which is the cause and source of true bounty, heavenly sustenance and everlasting life, that they might arise to assist the Cause of God and remove hatred and rancor from their midst. Should the possessors of insight regard with fairness the pearls of wisdom and utterance which have emerged from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen by the command of the Lord of all beings, the tongues of their realities and essences would testify that Baha hath not spoken of His own desire, but rather by that which He was commanded by God, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names.\n\nConsider the Shi'ih sect! Now all their divines mount the pulpits to curse the Desire of the worlds. What hath been the cause of this wrong and the reason for this heedlessness? By the life of God! It hath been naught but imitation and limitation. That which is befitting and conducive to the salvation, prosperity and reformation of the world and its peoples is but one thing: that the servants should observe and hearken with their own eyes and ears.\n\nO thou who art mentioned before the Face! Today the waves of the ocean of utterance are manifest before all faces, and the blessed Tree is adorned with new, wondrous and goodly fruits, and the splendors of the Sun of Truth are shining from the horizon of will, visible and manifest. Blessed is he who hath shown justice in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds, and joy be unto him who hath witnessed and seen and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the News mentioned in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy!\"\n\nIt is hoped that his honor will strive to exalt the Word of the Lord of all beings and shatter the idols of suppositions and fancies through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Today is the day of endeavor and service, that perchance through the efforts of steadfast souls the world may attain to that which is befitting and worthy. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. Strive, that perchance ye may, through celestial power, transform the abasement and heedlessness of people into elevation and glory. The day before, these special words were revealed from the heaven of divine wisdom to one of the wise ones, and are mentioned here that they may increase his honor's resolve: O Wise One! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The power and structure of faith have weakened; the supreme remedy is needed. The darkness of the peoples' base metal hath seized them; the greatest elixir is needed. O Wise One! Hath the crown of victory possessed such power as to transform diverse and differing elements into a single thing, raising it to the station of pure gold? Though its transformation appeareth difficult and complex, yet in the sight of this Wronged One the transformation of earthly power into celestial power is possible. That which transforms this power is greater than any elixir. This station and this power are specially reserved for the Word of God. It is the essence that transforms fear into assurance, weakness into strength, and abasement into glory. One drop from the ocean of divine wisdom struck Badi' and like a globe of fire he sought martyrdom. His moisture was transformed to fire, his weakness to power, and his sluggishness to swiftness. At this time, what is needed is to seek healing from the Incomparable Almighty for the diseases of ignorance, heedlessness, and vain imaginings. We beseech God to assist thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His chosen ones. God willing, thou shalt be assisted to take hold of the reins of wisdom. Verily God is the Almighty, the Powerful. The glory from Us be upon thee, and upon the learned one whom knowledge hath not veiled from the Known One, and upon the mystic whom mysticism hath not veiled from the Recognized One, and upon the unlettered one who hath broken the chains of limitation and believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nAt the end of the book, these words, which are the cause and means of the greatest attainment for the peoples and the cause of deliverance in these days, are mentioned: If it becomes possible and the means of movement and permission are provided, let his honor, for the sake of God, journey to these parts for a while and spend some days in association, that he may become aware of the reality of the Cause. This will become the means of deliverance for some of the servants. Now the objectors among the people of Bayan are tormented by fancies similar to the fancies of the previous party, but after meeting both parties, that which is now hidden will be revealed and they will attain to true understanding. This is a great undertaking and among the good deeds that had and has no likeness or equal. It is hoped that his honor will be assisted in what was mentioned and become the cause of deliverance for a number of the deluded ones. This is not difficult for God. We beseech Him to open through thee the door of understanding to all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and through thee to raise the standard of utterance to the highest heights. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.\n\n=== END BH00982 ===\n\n=== START BH00983 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise, thanksgiving, remembrance, glorification, peace and splendor, in the highest degree, befit the most holy and sublime threshold of the Desired One, Whose Pen of Will moves by day and night in remembrance of His chosen ones and near ones. Through the Kawthar of utterance which flows from Him, hearts and minds attain unto a wondrous new life. What pen could ever prove capable of giving thanks for this supreme benevolence and praise for this mighty gift? The waves of the ocean of bounty have appeared in such wise that those who wield the pen are powerless and incapable of enumerating them. His mercy has taken precedence, adorning nothingness with the ornament of existence. Blessed is the soul that in His days has attained, and has become possessed of but one word from His presence. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower, in the beginning and in the end.\n\nThereafter, O beloved of my heart! A few days ago brief replies were written to your detailed letters, and these were sent along with wondrous and exalted Tablets, that perchance assured souls might drink from the depths of the ocean of oneness concealed within the words of the Desired One of all worlds, and attain unto fresh life. Your letter, together with the letters and petitions of the friends, reached the Most Holy Court, and that which was specifically revealed for each one bears witness to the Day of God and all that hath been made manifest therein. As bidden, give the glad-tidings unto all and deliver whatsoever hath been sent, both past and present. Despite the world's upheavals and its incidents, and the hatred of the former party - namely the Shiites - the Most Exalted Pen hath not ceased from remembrance, and with the most loud-sounding call hath summoned and continueth to summon all.\n\nIn these days, praise be to God, the friends arrive continuously; no space remaineth. In two days, nineteen souls with radiant faces and illumined hearts arrived and attained. Though space is limited, by God's grace their hearts are vast. In hardship they are patient, holding fast to beautiful patience. The servant beseecheth his Lord to ordain for them the good of this world and the next. Papers numbering the numerical value of Bahhaj (11) were sent. In all cases, beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid all to that which is the cause of eternal remembrance and everlasting life. One Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for Haji Hassan (M.S.), upon him be the Glory of God, and one blessed Tablet specifically for Aqa Muhammad Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, in response to his petition. And specifically for the son, wife and uncle of Aqa Ali Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, sacred and luminous Tablets were revealed and sent; these will reach them. Indeed, what that beloved one wrote regarding their being set ablaze with the fire of love and their arising to serve the Cause is the truth, in which there is no doubt.\n\nAs to what was mentioned concerning the other loved ones, upon them be the Glory of God - all was presented at the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of His hearing. His blessed and exalted Word: \"O Amin! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness.\" The letters from your honor, both previous and recent, which you sent to this servant arrived and were presented at the Most Holy Court. We made mention of each of the loved ones mentioned therein. The gaze of the Wronged One has ever been directed toward His loved ones. God willing, may they attain to such a station wherein the happenings of the world will not hold them back from remembrance, praise and service to the Cause. May they be ignited by the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree and illumined by the light of His Cause. Specifically regarding those souls mentioned from Kaf and Ra for whom your honor requested Tablets - each has attained that around which the ocean of utterance circles. We beseech God to assist them through His grace, to remind them of His verses, draw them nigh unto Him, and ordain for them the Most Great Steadfastness. God willing, it is hoped they will attain this most great and mighty station and behold all else but God as a mere handful of clay.\n\nO My beloved! The helpless servants are unaware, imagining that Hadi-i-Dawlat-Abadi and Mirza Baqir-i-Isfahani are cognizant of the Cause. Every person of insight and hearing testifies that all were and are utterly ignorant and move in absolute darkness. That most grievous calamity was never with the Truth but appeared through a deception that had and has no likeness or equal. The Tablets of God which the late Aqa Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, carried upon first arriving at the prison fell into the hands of that deceitful oppressor, who gave them to Mirza Hadi, son of that illusory person. He copied them in his own hand in Yahya's name and sent them to certain places. Where has fairness gone? What happened to justice? They have turned away from the Truth which, from the beginning of the Cause until now, has openly and without any veil summoned the peoples of East and West to the Supreme Horizon, while they cling to idle fancies and idols. Leave them to their vain desires and leave them in their idle discourse, for they neither perceive, nor recognize, nor know. Glory be to God! Verses have been revealed and descended like rain, yet the heedless ones of the world claim knowledge and, like the former party, have strived and continue to strive to mislead the servants. In that dispensation, a few souls deprived the helpless servants of eternal bounty, everlasting sustenance, and the recognition of God, exalted be His glory. This evanescent servant beseeches and implores God to raise up servants who will protect people from former superstitions, break the idols of falsehood and fancy, and turn toward the station of truth and certitude. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Lord of the Throne and earth.\n\nConvey greetings from this evanescent servant to the loved ones in every land. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to cause all to attain that which leads to the reformation of the world and the life of nations. Verily, He has power over all things. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you and hear your word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\nIn the sacred month of Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1305\n\n=== END BH00983 ===\n\n=== START BH00984 ===\n\nQuestions were submitted concerning the divine ordinances, and from the Dayspring of grace this answer shone forth and appeared, these are His words, exalted be His glory: O Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! God willing, may you be successful through God's grace in all worlds. Your questions are accepted before the Throne, for in them lies benefit for all creation. We have specifically commanded you to inquire about the divine laws and verses. We have made you a source of good for the servants. You must at all times enjoin the people to observe the divine ordinances, that perchance they may attain to that which God has commanded and that which benefits their own selves. Although few souls are observed to be obedient to the divine commandments - for instance, while many in various lands have attained to the light of faith, only a few have as yet succeeded in acting according to that which has been revealed by Him - We had previously written to you that had the people of that land paid the Huququ'llah, they would have found comfort. Prior to its being decreed, none were bound by it, and the Supreme Pen had, for a number of years, paused in the revelation of ordinances and commandments, and this was due to divine grace. Were the people of the world to recognize the fruits of that which the All-Merciful has revealed, all would arise to fulfill His bidding and act according to what He has ordained. However, in light of the wisdom revealed in God's Tablets, there is no harm in foregoing certain laws which today cause commotion among the people and become cause for their veiling. But as for those deeds which do not cause aversion and notoriety, such as prayers, payment of rights, and the like, all must surely act upon these. Regarding Zakat, We have commanded that they should act as was revealed in the Qur'an. God willing, in these days some verses of the Most Holy Book will be explained in Persian, and within them mention will be made of certain laws that have not been revealed. Verily thy Lord, in all circumstances, desires the good of His loved ones and teaches them His straight, clear, and right path.\n\nWhen a person acquires ownership of one thousand mithqals of gold and pays its Huququ'llah, no further Huququ'llah is payable on that property unless it increases through trade and business dealings and reaches the amount subject to Huququ'llah - that is, on any profits derived therefrom. In such cases, one must act according to what God has decreed. However, if the property passes into other hands, Huququ'llah becomes payable on it again as it was the first time. At that point, the Right of God must be paid. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to enable His loved ones to partake of the ocean of His good-pleasure, which is the cause and means of salvation for all peoples of the world, and to willingly act in accordance with that which ensures the purification and preservation of existence. The Primal Point has stated that Huququ'llah must be paid on the value of all things that one possesses, but in view of His supreme bounty, We have exempted household furnishings and one's residence - that is, such furnishings as are needed.\n\nAs to the question that was asked regarding which takes precedence - Huququ'llah, the debts of the deceased, or funeral expenses - God's decree is that funeral expenses take precedence, followed by payment of debts, and then the payment of Huququ'llah. Verily, He will discharge the debts of His loved ones, and who is more capable of this than He? He is the Fulfiller, the Payer, the Generous One. If the estate is insufficient to cover the debts, whatever is available should be distributed proportionally, whether little or much. The matter of debt is of great importance. In the Book it is written: \"Blessed is he who ascendeth unto God, and hath no debt to any one, nor any Right of God or of His servants due from him.\" It has been known that the Right of God takes precedence over all other rights; however, purely as a bounty, the Manifestation of Revelation has decreed what hath been set down in this Tablet by His life-giving and all-knowing Pen \\[...\\] regarding inheritance, that if there be no offspring, their shares revert to the House of Justice, and when any of the other categories are not present, such as father, mother, brother, sister, or teacher, whether their shares also revert to the House of Justice or are otherwise disposed - this matter hath been revealed in the Book of God. He saith, exalted be He: \"Should one die and leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice\" and so forth. And: \"Should one leave offspring but none of the other categories specified in the Book, two-thirds of what they leave shall revert to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice.\" Thus hath the All-Mighty, the Most Exalted, decreed with grandeur and majesty. If there be offspring but some or all of the other souls - father, mother, brother, sister and others - are absent, the shares of those souls shall be divided into three parts: two parts shall revert to the offspring and one part to the House of Justice. The meaning of the blessed verse is thus: one who hath offspring but none of what is below it, that is, none of what is below offspring among those specified in the Book - namely the aforementioned souls of father, mother, spouse, brother, sister and teacher - two-thirds of the shares of the aforementioned souls from what the deceased hath left shall revert to the offspring and one-third to the House of Justice. And this decree applieth whether all or some of these categories are absent.\n\n=== END BH00984 ===\n\n=== START BH00985 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nThe throne hath been established and upon it hath been seated the Ancient Beauty, Who hath called out in the most exalted voice among the nations: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Thereupon did the Nightingale of Immortality warble upon the branches of the Tree of Utterance: \"The appointed time hath passed and the Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty.\" How excellent is he who hath heard, turned unto, and answered his Ancient Lord! He is assuredly among those who are brought near in a noble Book.\n\nThereafter, when I heard the whistling of the bird of thy longing and yearning, and was drawn by the mention of the Beloved and the praise of the Desired One which thou hadst made as a crown for thy letter, I repaired to the Most Exalted Goal and the Dayspring of the signs of our Great Lord. When I attained His presence, I presented what was in thy letter. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His glory: \"O Husayn! Rejoice that the face of the Beloved hath turned toward thee from this Station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names and with that which none hath known save God, the Lord of all worlds. The servant present hath brought thy letter and presented its contents. Thy Lord verily is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. Be thou assured through thy Lord's grace - He hath forgiven thee as a bounty from His presence. He verily is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Preserve thou this most exalted Station and place thy trust at all times in the One, the All-Informed.\"\n\nWe have desired in this Station to make mention of him who ascended unto Us and attained the Supreme Companion, the Station whereby the eyes of those brought near were solaced. He was named Lu?f-'Ali in the Kingdom of Names, and there was revealed for him from the Most Exalted Pen that which hath perfumed with its fragrance the heavens and the earth. Blessed art thou, O Lu?f-'Ali, in that the Desired One maketh mention of thee from this luminous horizon. The mercy that floweth from the chalice of thy Lord's benevolence be upon thee, O thou who didst believe in God and turn unto Him when every heedless one turned away. Thou art he who remained faithful to God's Covenant and His Testament, and answered His call when it was raised amongst the servants. Thy Lord is verily the Faithful Witness. Thou art he whom the veils withheld not from the Lord of Lords. Thou didst turn unto the Most Exalted Horizon and didst attain unto the knowledge of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who remembereth thee after thee even as thy Lord, the Speaker, the True, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, hath remembered thee.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Turn Thy face unto him who was named Najaf-'Ali, then make mention of him in such wise that his remembrance may endure in God's Kingdom, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thou art he who shattered the idol of fancy and took hold of the Book of Certitude in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. I bear witness that thou didst believe in God when He appeared with the truth and didst drink My choice sealed wine. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who visiteth thee purely for the sake of God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom. Rejoice in that the Most Exalted Pen hath testified for thee in His praiseworthy station. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto this mention, which nothing on earth can equal, yet most people comprehend not.\n\nO Husayn! Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto divine bounty. Thou must at all times act in a manner befitting the Day of God, and what befitteth this Day is steadfastness in the Cause of Truth, for the cawing ones have been and are lying in wait. This is a Day wherein all must fix their gaze upon the Truth itself, for verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee that wherefrom thou dost find the fragrance of His favor, which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. He hath, of a truth, forgiven thy sin and those of His loved ones who ascended there, as a bounty from His presence. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe give glad tidings to Our loved ones there of Our attention to them from this glorious station. O friends! The Most Exalted Pen is moved to mention you, and the Tongue of Grandeur speaks your names. Strive that ye may preserve this greatest bounty in the name of the Lord of Eternity, for the adornments of the world are the source of heedlessness and the wellspring of pride. How many souls counted themselves among the most learned, yet when the divine Word - which was the true touchstone - appeared, all returned to their stations save whom God wished. The people of the Bayan are seen today to be more veiled than the people of the Furqan, for they cling exactly to the same tales as before and have not inhaled the fragrance of the Day of God. The dwellers of the Crimson Ark - namely the people of Baha - have, with Abraham's strength, shattered the idols of vain imaginings and idle fancies. Blessed are they, then blessed are they! God willing, the friends of Truth in that land and other regions have attained and continue to attain to this lofty, most exalted station. The glory of God, the One, the All-Informed, be upon them.\n\nThis evanescent one requests that you convey expressions of utter nothingness and self-effacement to each of the loved ones of God. The servant beseeches his Lord to grant them success, to strengthen them, to draw them nigh, to exalt them, to honor them, to ordain for them the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to make them among those whom no blame of the blamer, nor the gloating of the polytheist, nor the oppression of the oppressor, nor the transgression of any froward tyrant can turn away from God.\n\nThe evanescence of the world is evident and clear, requiring no proof or argument. Therefore, the possessor of insight does not deprive himself of the Most Great Vision on account of it. O friends! Time has passed and days have gone by, and the Day of God, through the infinite bounty of the Lord, is present and you have attained unto its recognition. Strive that ye may be assisted in that which befits this blessed Day. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath said that all exist that their names might be mentioned but once in the Holy Presence. Praise be to God that ye have attained this greatest bounty and reached this most great favor. God willing, ye shall be successful in preserving it as well. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is no God but He, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Glory, mercy, majesty and grandeur be upon you and upon the fruits and leaves of the Tree of Knowledge in that place and in all regions. And praise be to God, the Revealer of verses.\n\nThe Servant\n\n27 Muharram 1298\n\nRegarding what was written about the letters, news of this had already arrived from the Land of Ha and continues to arrive, and praise be to God, it was adorned with the ornament of acceptance.\n\n=== END BH00985 ===\n\n=== START BH00986 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!\n\nYour letter hath come before Our presence and the gaze of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath been directed towards it. I have apprehended its contents and understood what thou didst desire concerning that matter whereby the eye of certitude was gladdened. O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and standeth before the Throne! Hearken unto the call from the Most Glorious Tree which hath risen through its own power in the Cause, and which neither the heedlessness of those who remained unmindful nor the oppression of those who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, could impede.\n\nO Mustafa! By My life! Whoso heareth My call with the ear of the heart, verily he soareth in the atmosphere of My love and subdueth all who are on earth through My Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. He who hath found the sweetness of the utterance which hath proceeded from the mouth of the All-Merciful hath adorned his heart with the ornament of faith in such wise that the very essence of certitude proclaimeth from behind him: \"Blessed art thou, O thou through whom the temple of tranquility hath been adorned with the raiment of love for the mention of the Name of thy Lord, the Glorious, the Most High, the Mighty, the Wondrous!\"\n\nGrieve not at anything. Put thy trust in God at all times. Verily, He will help thee as He helped thee before when thou wast heedless of the Cause. Then did We unveil the Beauty and manifest unto thee that which is better in thy Lord's sight than all that hath been created in the heavens and earth. We took thy hand with the hand of grace and power and delivered thee through Our sovereign might. Verily thy Lord's mercy hath preceded all creation.\n\nBe not disturbed by what the tongues of the people utter. The Sovereign of the Day hath come, and now He calleth unto thee from the horizon of the House: \"Be at peace through thy Lord's favor and say: 'Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!'\" Blessed art thou for having heard the call and having said: \"Yea, yea, O Beloved of the worlds!\" Rejoice thou in thy Lord's gladness in such wise that thy joy may influence Our servants whom the stupor of sorrows hath overtaken because they followed vain imaginings. Rend asunder the veil of idle fancy through My Name, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God! He Who is known hath come with great sovereignty. We have commanded the people to follow what is known and forbidden them from what is imagined. Some have attained to what their Lord desired, while others have clung to their own desires - these are verily among the lost.\n\nO Mustafa! By My life! Thou art beneath My wing and within the stronghold of My protection. Preserve this station through the remembrance of My Name, the Guardian over the worlds. Let not the clamor of those who have committed what they were forbidden grieve thee. The winds of passion have stirred them. Among them are those who have returned and repented. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hands of his Lord, the Mighty, the Most High - he is assuredly among the triumphant.\n\nHow many are the servants who claim with their tongues what is not in their hearts, and God revealeth it through one means or another. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We bear witness that thou hast turned unto God with pure sincerity for His radiant and luminous face. From whomsoever thou perceivest the fragrance of aversion, in whatever land he may be, avoid him, then turn with thy heart to the Qiblih of them that know.\n\nSay: O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Name, through which what lay hidden in hearts and breasts was revealed, to make me content with what Thou hast ordained for me and to fix my gaze upon Thee under all conditions. Verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful. O my Lord! Preserve me within the shelter of Thy great mercy, then cause me to speak Thy praise amidst the concourse of creation in such wise that I may become forgetful of myself and evanescent in Thy Name. Verily Thou art He in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things. Thou ordainest what Thou pleasest and doest what Thou desirest.\n\nO Mustafa! Thus has the Tongue of Eternity spoken in the Most Great Prison. Read thou and be of the thankful ones. Then remember wherefore We named this Prison the Most Great, after We had formerly been under chains and fetters. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Believe not what thou hast heard and hearest. Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty hath spoken in this station wherein the Kingdom crieth out: \"My spirit be a sacrifice to Thy dust,\" then the Realm of Might: \"My soul be a sacrifice to Thy air,\" then the Kingdom of Names: \"All my being be a sacrifice to Thy prison,\" O Thou at Whose finger's beckoning every wise decree is suspended! Be thou at all times directing thy gaze toward the court of thy Lord's will. When the Sun of His Command dawneth from His horizon, say thou with submission and contentment: \"My soul be a sacrifice to Thy command, O Thou Who art the Desire of the sincere ones!\" We have chosen thee and adorned thee with the garment of My love. By God! Soon shall the tongues of all things speak forth thy praise and the praise of those who have cast away their idle fancies and have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Glorious Horizon. These, verily, are of them that are nigh unto God. Through My remembrance is every matter established. Be thou assured by that which hath flowed from My tongue in thy praise, and by thy mention from the Lord of the Pens, through Whose movement the hearts of them that are detached have taken flight.\n\nO Mustafa! When the Tablet was read before Our face a second time, We added to it another word. Know thou that aforetime it was revealed: \"Soon shall the prison door be opened, and he that entered shall go forth and he that went forth shall enter,\" and in another Tablet: \"Soon shall that which was closed be opened and that which was joined be severed, and he that was forbidden shall enter and he that was gathered shall be scattered, and that which was difficult shall be made easy, and that which was hidden shall be revealed.\" Ponder, O ye who are endued with discernment, that ye may recognize what hath been inscribed of the mysteries.\n\nO Mustafa! By My life, every matter hath been revealed in the Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. They who were not present before the Throne yet claim inner presence - these have followed vain imaginings, by thy Lord, the All-Knowing! He who hath attained the presence of the Countenance in the manifest outer realm - this is better for him than the worship of both humans and jinn. Around this outward manifestation revolve the worlds of the inner reality, yet the people remain in evident obscurity.\n\nIf thou seest the letter Nun before ?a', say: \"Look unto thy Lord and not unto thyself.\" Thou wilt not see the raven as a dove - thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. Blessed is the soul that hath attained the presence of the Throne and to whom We have testified reunion - he is the best of men before thy gracious Lord. How many who were near, to whom We testified not nearness, and how many who were far, for whom the decree of nearness was revealed from the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Impregnable! Blessed is he who hath attained and recognized both excellences - he hath outstripped all others. Verily thy Lord confirmeth what He willeth. How many who were near are in the highest paradise, and how many who were near are in the lowest fire. Thus hath the decree shone forth from the horizon of the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in this mighty Prison. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained, and been blessed, and been present, and have drunk, and have heard, and have said: \"Here am I, here am I, O Lord of the worlds!\"\n\n=== END BH00986 ===\n\n=== START BH00987 ===\n\nWhoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let\n\nhim stand up and turn unto God, and,\n\nas he standeth in his place, let him gaze\n\nto the right and to the left, as if awaiting\n\nthe mercy of his Lord, the Most\n\nMerciful, the Compassionate.

I implore Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy and the Day-Star of Thy grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and pleasest. By Thy might which is far above all mention and praise! Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved of my soul. O God, my God!

Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to his most exalted home beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within the precincts of Thy mercy; and this transgressor seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly one the court of Thy glory; and this poor creature the orient of Thy wealth. Thine is the authority to command whatsoever Thou willest. I bear witness that Thou art to be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behests, and to remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.\n\nLet him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name. Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God --blessed and exalted be He -- and say:\n\nThou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath been stirred up within my limbs and members, in its longing to worship Thee, and in its yearning to remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth to that whereunto the Tongue of Thy Commandment hath testified in the kingdom of Thine utterance and the heaven of Thy knowledge. I love, in this state, O my Lord, to beg of Thee all that is with Thee, that I may demonstrate my poverty, and magnify Thy bounty and Thy riches, and may declare my powerlessness, and manifest Thy power and Thy might.\n\nLet him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:\n\nThere is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

Thou seest, O my Lord, this wretched creature knocking at the door of Thy grace, and this evanescent soul seeking the river of everlasting life from the hands of Thy bounty. Thine is the command at all times, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names; and mine is resignation and willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the heavens!\n\nLet him then raise his hands thrice, and say:\n\nGreater is God than every great one!\n\nLet him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground, say:\n\nToo high art Thou for the praise of those who are nigh unto Thee to ascend unto the heaven of Thy nearness, or for the birds of the hearts of them who are devoted to Thee to attain to the door of Thy gate. I testify that Thou hast been sanctified above all attributes and holy above all names. No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.\n\nLet him then seat himself and say:\n\nI testify unto that whereunto have testified all created things, and the Concourse on high, and the inmates of the all-highest Paradise, and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from the all-glorious Horizon, that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, and that He Who hath been manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the letters B and E (Be) have been joined and knit together. I testify that it is He Whose name hath been set down by the Pen of the Most High, and Who hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.\n\nLet him then stand erect and say:\n\nO Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and invisible! Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter, and hearest my groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart. By Thy might! My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto Thee; and my sins have held me far from the court of Thy holiness. Thy love, O my Lord, hath enriched me, and separation from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness from Thee hath consumed me. I entreat Thee by Thy footsteps in this wilderness, and by the words \"Here am I. Here am I\" which Thy chosen Ones have uttered in this immensity, and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and the gentle winds of the Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may gaze on Thy beauty and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book.\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands resting on the knees, and say:\n\nPraise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast aided me to remember Thee and to praise Thee, and hast made known unto me Him Who is the Day-Spring of Thy signs, and hast caused me to bow down before Thy Lordship, and humble myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge that which hath been uttered by the Tongue of Thy grandeur.\n\nLet him then rise and say:\n\nO God, my God! My back is bowed by the burden of my sins, and my heedlessness hath destroyed me. Whenever I ponder my evil doings and Thy benevolence, my heart melteth within me, and my blood boileth in my veins. By Thy Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world! I blush to lift up my face to Thee, and my longing hands are ashamed to stretch forth toward the heaven of Thy bounty. Thou seest, O my God, how my tears prevent me from remembering Thee and from extolling Thy virtues, O Thou the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below! I implore Thee by the signs of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to do with Thy loved ones as becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of all being, and is worthy of Thy grace, O King of the seen and the unseen!\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name\n\nthrice, and kneel with his forehead to\n\nthe ground, and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou hast sent down unto us that which draweth us nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good thing sent down by Thee in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures. Protect us, we beseech Thee, O my Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginations. Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nLet him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:\n\nI testify, O my God, to that whereunto Thy chosen Ones have testified, and acknowledge that which the inmates of the all-highest Paradise and those who have circled round Thy mighty Throne have acknowledged. The kingdoms of earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of the worlds!\n\nLong obligatory prayer, to be recited once in twenty-four hours.\n\n=== END BH00987 ===\n\n=== START BH00988 ===\n\nI testify that there is none other God beside Him. He has ever been and will forever be. He spoke when He ascended the throne, and through Him the sincere ones proclaimed that there is none other God beside Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Then He spoke another word, whereupon the earth and heaven were shaken. Among them were those who, having heard His sweet call, arose from the slumber of vain fancy and, detached from all created things, turned toward the Supreme Horizon. And among them were those who heard the Call yet turned away and joined with the dead, as though they had never found the fragrance of the Beloved nor were stirred by the breeze that wafted from the direction of the throne of their Lord, the All-Merciful. Alas for those who witnessed yet denied, who heard yet remained heedless. By God! They are among the basest of creatures. They have deprived themselves of the water of everlasting life, their ears of the call of the All-Merciful, and their eyes of that which hath shone forth from the horizon of possibility. Praise be to God Who hath made known to us that which appeared in those days and informed us of that which was hidden in His knowledge, from which no thing whatsoever can escape. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect us by His sovereignty and to ordain for us that which is best for us. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice unto your remembrance. This evanescent one hath been blessed by your mention, which was illumined by the lights of this Day and perfumed with the love of God. When I received, opened, read and became acquainted with it, I presented its contents before the Throne, and there appeared from the Beloved that which I am powerless to describe. All things bear witness to His favors unto you and His attention toward you. We beseech Him to send down for you that which will exalt the Cause of God and gladden the hearts of them that are endowed with understanding.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the sending of Tablets, it is evident that your honor has ever been and will continue to be confirmed in service to the Cause. And regarding what you wrote about the Holy House, it was presented in the Most Holy Court. He spoke, and His Word is the Truth: We have sent down all matters with wisdom, and We have taken their covenant from those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and believed in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing. O My Afnan! Hold fast unto them in all conditions. This is that which the All-Merciful hath permitted as a grace from His presence. He, verily, is the Ever-Bestowing, the Ancient.\n\nAny matter which today causeth the people to shun, or which giveth rise to clamor among the multitude, or causes agitation of hearts and perturbation of souls - to engage in such is not permissible. All must abide in the calmness of God and His dignity, serene and assured. I swear by the Subduer of the world that whosoever today ariseth to serve the Cause, though it be less than an atom, and acteth according to that which God hath revealed in the Book, shall assuredly be rewarded for it in this world and in all the worlds of God.\n\nThe balance of justice hath ever had and shall have two scales: the reward of the righteous and the retribution of the wrongdoers. This is the true polity whereon depend the order of the world, its stability, and the tranquility of the servants. However, today the Eye of Bounty regardeth the beginning, for the All-Loving, the Munificent Truth hath manifested Himself. By My life! The Pen is powerless to describe a single day of this time. Whoso becometh aware of the mysteries of the Books which We have sent down aforetime unto Our Messengers would be astounded and would cry out: \"This is the Day whose light illumineth the Concourse on High and the faces of those near unto God!\"\n\nWere it not for His grace and other wisdoms, verily those souls who have caused the least harm and injury to the loved ones of God would have been cast into the lowest depths of hell, and the earth would not have borne them for a moment. This applieth to the weak, heedless, and ignorant souls. As for those who arose in utter opposition and who stood against the Dawning-Places of God's love and the Daysprings of His remembrance in this Most Great Revelation with rejection and protest, they have been and shall be seized by the hand of power. Verily, thy Lord is the Avenger, the Mighty Wielder of Authority.\n\nFrom this most exalted station, We make mention of the Most Exalted Leaf and send Our blessings upon her countenance and upon the countenances of those who have believed in God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Know thou that thou hast been beneath the shadow of thy Lord and under the gaze of thy Master, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Rejoice thou in what hath been ordained for thee in the Most Glorious Kingdom and in what hath flowed in thy praise from the Most Exalted Pen, through which every hidden matter hath been revealed. Look thou in all circumstances unto wisdom. This is what God hath sent down in His preserved Tablet.\n\nVerily, the people are intoxicated with the wine of their own desires to such an extent that they know not what they utter. They speak as their desires command them and purchase with their souls and their wealth the wrath of God, yet today they comprehend not. Grieve thou not over anything. By My life! Thou art within the precincts of My mercy, the pavilion of My protection, and the tabernacle of My exalted glory.\n\nO My Afnan! Whoso speaketh against you shall soon find himself in manifest loss. Erelong shall the tongues of all created things speak forth your praise and your nearness unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We counsel you to preserve that whereunto ye have attained, that there may appear from you that which shall attract the hearts and tranquilize the souls of those who have recognized God. O My Afnan! Behold, then remember what befell My house in Iraq, when people entered it without My permission. Verily, thy Lord is the Oppressed One, despite His sovereignty, and the Ruled One, though His Pen commandeth all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nSend forth the words of thy Lord unto Mine Afnan in the land of Shin that they may rejoice in God's bounty and act in accordance with that which hath been made easy and simple for them. We have revealed in the Tablets the preservation of Mine Afnan and We do preserve them in truth, despite those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. Nevertheless, We bid them to act with wisdom, lest there should arise that which would cause the barking of the polytheists to be raised. Whatsoever hath been and is revealed from the Supreme Pen hath been and is for the good of all. The Sun of Truth hath been the Divine Word, and the education of all is dependent upon it. God willing, may all act with joy and fragrance in accordance with that which hath flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful. All the pilgrims present their pure devotion, utter effacement, complete nothingness, and most exalted greetings in service to that Holy Being.\n\nIn Safar 1295.\n\n=== END BH00988 ===\n\n=== START BH00989 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and dispatched the Messengers and revealed the Books in demonstration of His generosity, grace, gifts and favors, and Who hath ordained for every land a portion of the effulgent lights of His Revelation and the Sun of His knowledge and wisdom, until the appointed time had come and the hour of the Hijaz arrived. Then from that land was diffused the fragrance of His Revelation, and the Light shone forth from its horizon, and the treasuries of knowledge were made manifest therein, and the signs of power appeared therefrom, and the breezes of revelation encompassed its cities, its regions and its environs, whereupon the sacred vale trembled and swelled with longing and ardent desire for the meeting of the Manifestation of the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. The world was moved by its movement and the celestial spheres by its yearning and desire. He it is through Whose manifestation the Dove of Utterance warbled upon every branch in diverse melodies: \"O people of creation! There hath come unto you the Dawning-Place of your Lord's revelation, the Most Merciful, through Whom the Sun of Names hath shone forth and the Stars of Attributes have gleamed, and through Whom that which was hidden in His knowledge and treasured in the repositories of His protection hath been made manifest. He it is through Whom the celestial spheres and all within them, and the earth and all that is thereon, have been ennobled.\" And when the dawn of His manifestation broke forth, the breezes of the Most Merciful wafted over all lands, whereby every one that was seated arose, and every tongue that was mute spoke forth, and every stagnant water began to flow, and every blind one saw, and every thirsty one was refreshed, and every troubled one found peace, and every seeker attained his goal, and every remote one drew nigh. Upon Him be the peace of God and His prayers and the mercy of God and His light, and upon His family and His companions whom God made the Hands of His Cause in His lands and the manifestations of His power amongst His servants. Through them did every one that had turned away return, and every denier acknowledged the unity of God, and every proud one was affrighted. Through them were emperors humbled and pharaohs and tyrants thrown into confusion. They were those at whose lights of unity the very foundations of polytheism trembled, and by whose steadfastness and uprising in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Kingdom and of the Realm of Glory and Might, the mountains were scattered.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest the warriors under the grasp of the transgressors and the unitarians between the fangs of the idolaters. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power which encompasseth all created things, and by Thy might whereby all possibilities are rendered powerless, to protect Thy unitarian servants from the idolaters and their cannons and rifles and swords. O Lord! Thou seest Thy party among the parties and beneath the claws of a pack of wolves. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Lords, by Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers and Thy Books, and by Him Whom Thou hast established in Thy stead in the kingdom of creation and chosen from among the Prophets to manifest Thy hidden mystery, O Creator of heaven and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names! O Lord! There hath befallen the unitarians that which hath caused the pens to cease their flow and the tongues their utterance. Thou seest, O my God, my Beloved, my Purpose and my Adored One, the sighs of Thy chosen ones and the tears of Thy loved ones. Have mercy, then, upon Thy servants and deliver them from every anguish and calamity and from every torment and hardship. O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward the horizon of Thy grace, hastening to the ocean of Thy bounty, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and the unseen! My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy triumph wherewith Thou didst aid in the earliest days Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, to aid in these days Thy servants who have arisen to strive in Thy path and who have stood with supreme courage before the faces of Thine enemies. O Lord! Preserve them, then, through Thy protection, exalt them through Thy power and might, and assist them with the hosts of the seen and unseen. Verily Thou art the Guardian of the world and the Educator of the nations, and art powerful over all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful. O Lord! Send down upon Thy warriors from the heaven of Thy bounty the rains of Thy mercy and blessing. Then strengthen, O my God, their hearts, make their faces radiant, and illumine their eyes with the lights of Thy knowledge and recognition. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, and Whom the hosts of earth and heaven cannot frighten. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy might. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd furthermore, O my dear son, upon thee be my peace. What hath reached me hath brought me glad tidings of thy health and the soundness of thy constitution, and of thy standing up for the sake of God in the face of those enemies who desire to extinguish the light of God with their mouths. But God will not allow aught but that His light be perfected, though the idolaters be averse. This servant beseecheth God, his Lord and your Lord, to assist those who strive among our monotheistic brethren, to aid them with the hosts of the unseen and the seen, to grant them victory through His might and His power and His sovereignty, and to manifest through you what He hath sent down in His perspicuous Book. The hosts of God shall be triumphant. We praise Him and thank Him in the nights and days that He hath made our brethren among those who hasten to holy war in His path and who act according to what He hath revealed in His Book. Verily He heareth and answereth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech Him, exalted be He, that all may return to their homelands, enjoying the victory of God which is nigh. Verily He is our Lord, our Goal, and our Object of worship. Nothing frustrateth Him and no matter preventeth Him. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Lord! Aid those who strive in Thy path with the hosts of earth and heaven, and through Thy might whereby the backs of the princes were broken among the Pharaohs of the earth and its tyrants - they who denied Thy signs and turned away from Thy proof and shed the blood of Thy loved ones and seized Thy cities and Thy domains. O Lord! Thou art He before Whose power the essence of might hath bowed down, and before Whose strength the very reality of force hath submitted. I beseech Thee to protect the people of unity from the fire of polytheism and hatred. Verily Thou art He through Whose Name the gates of victory were opened before the faces of all created things. O Lord! Ordain for every face that hath turned unto Thee and advanced to aid Thy Faith and Thy Cause the best of this world and the next, and that which Thou hast ordained in Thy Book, O Lord of all humanity and Sovereign of the throne on high and of the dust below. O God, my God! Send Thy blessings upon those whom no blame of the blamer nor mockery of the mocker hath kept back from Thee, who have advanced toward Thee with radiant faces to serve Thy Faith, O Lord of all things! There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest.\n\n=== END BH00989 ===\n\n=== START BH00990 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!\n\nPraise be to God Who has caused all things to speak forth His remembrance and praise, and has chosen from among them His servants whom He has made mirrors of His names and attributes, and has manifested from them one who summoned all to His path and guided them to the standard of His justice, the heaven of His grace, and the luminary of His bounty. Prayers and peace be upon the Lord of the Prophets, the Sovereign of the Chosen Ones, and the Beloved of the saints, through whom His verses were spread abroad and the fragrance of His Revelation was diffused and His commandments and laws were brought forth--He who was named by the Most Beautiful Names among the Concourse on High and the people of the kingdom of creation--and upon His family and companions, through whom the pavilion of glory was raised among the nations and the breeze of divine knowledge wafted over the world, and through whom God revealed what was hidden in knowledge and veiled from sight. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that heart's beloved came as a Kawthar of love and faithfulness, quenching the thirst of separation and bestowing the rest of reunion. After its reading and perusal it was presented before the face of the Master and achieved the honor of His attention. He--may our spirits be sacrificed for Him--said: \"O Rida! The Wronged One sends His greetings to you and beseeches God to strengthen you in His remembrance and praise, and in acting according to what He has revealed in His Book, and to give you to drink, at all times, of the choice wine of divine knowledge, and to enable you to perform good deeds and to manifest praiseworthy characteristics. Verily, He is the Lord of creation. He counsels you with that which brings joy to the eyes of the sincere ones and gladdens the hearts of those who are near. Through deeds are the stations of men made manifest. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest the affairs and events of this world prevent you from the bounty of the next world and its effulgences. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Neither the might of His servants nor the power of those who have denied the Day of Judgment can prevent Him from what He desireth.\"\n\nIn truth, this servant was greatly gladdened by the letter of that spiritual beloved, for it was adorned with the mention of the people of divine unity. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, on behalf of each one, for that which is the cause and means of enduring remembrances and eternal attributes. Once, when I was in the presence of the Master, He said to write to Rida to \\[recite\\] this blessed verse. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\n\"And whosoever feareth God, He will make for him a way out, and will provide for him from whence he expecteth not. And whosoever putteth his trust in God, He will suffice him. Verily, God will accomplish His purpose. Indeed, God hath set a measure for all things.\" O Rida! Hold fast unto fear of God. Verily, it will guard thee from all that God loveth not. The fear of God is a blessed and beloved garment that preserveth man from the darts of Satan and guardeth him from every rejected deed and forbidden mention. Praise be to God that you are mentioned and are holding fast to the cord of love. Blessed be you!\n\nIt was not permissible to mention in letters or recite in the presence of the monotheists, upon them be God's peace, for the understanding of the servants falls short of comprehending certain divine verses. This may give rise to controversy, as the Shi'ih sect's imaginings have led to suspicion and doubt - they may infer from a word that which never crossed the mind of the speaker. O Rida, hold fast to the hem of silence, for therein lies safety. In the tradition it is stated: \"O Abu Dharr, for everything there is evidence - the evidence of intellect is contemplation, and the evidence of contemplation is silence.\" And likewise it is said: \"The most excellent worship is silence.\" The virtues of silence are many. In truth it is a mighty fortress for the protection of the servants. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist us in what He loves and is pleased with.\n\nLet this matter not escape the notice of that spiritual friend. The perfect mystics, mature scholars, and those possessed of protection and preservation have complained of speech and praised and extolled silence. The servant beseeches his Lord to adorn His servants with the ornament of silence and protect them from the spark of speech.\n\nRegarding what was written about breathing the air and strolling in gardens and open spaces - this brought joy and gladness. However, I beseech the Truth to confirm you and this servant that we may discern the signs of divine craftsmanship in all things and increase in thanksgiving and praise. This is our blessing and His table of bounty. May it remain and endure. Every mighty matter is easy and simple before His favor. He brought His servants into being from the ocean of generosity, and its traces are inscribed and recorded by the manifest pen on the tablets of the servants' existence. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to preserve us from the evil of the polytheists who have surrounded the abodes of the monotheists. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of the mystics and the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nAnother glad tiding is that the fruit of that spiritual friend's labor has appeared, and the signs of freshness and delicacy from the spring rain of divine mercy are evident in the sent wood. I beseech the Truth, exalted be His glory, to bless and favor that friend with its manifest fruits, and to adorn the true trees, which are the manifestation of human realms, with wondrous, delicate, and novel fruits, that all may benefit and utter the word \"Grace and mercy belong to God.\" Truly this is cause for thanksgiving, for His bounty has become manifest and the work has borne fruit. The servant bears witness that He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nRegarding the fruits of that garden which were mentioned, this is correct, for God has named those lands the Holy Land. Although the actions of Yazid lowered its station in the eyes of some, yet in the sight of those endowed with true knowledge it was, is, and ever shall be the Holy Land. This is a robe of honor bestowed by God, exalted be His glory, and none can strip it away from it. Nay, by His very Self, the Truth, no one has been or ever shall be able to do so. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Mighty. If it be possible, and can be arranged with the utmost joy and fragrance, let them send several grafts from each of those two varieties of plum that were described, as well as from the peaches that were sent and the other trees that were mentioned, though their fruits are not yet known. Now is the time for this. This too is truly a service that benefits all. That honored one knows well that whatever has been and is being done is for the sake of God, that it may become a place to delight the eyes of His loved ones and a spot where the manifestations of true love may find recreation. Since this work is for the sake of God, its effects will certainly become manifest. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

It was as though I beheld therein lofty trees, each bearing the fruits of inner meanings and utterance, and upon every branch thereof the birds of divine knowledge were singing their various melodies, for it was adorned with the mention of God, the Lord of all possibilities and the Revealer of all religions. After reading and becoming acquainted with its contents, I approached the Praiseworthy Station and presented what was therein before the face of our Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. He spoke, and His sweetest utterance is this:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient, the Most Great\n\nO 'Ali! The servant present here hath brought thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One, through Whom the various parties have become divided - some turned away, some denied, and some pronounced judgment against Him without any proof or Book.

Take hold of the Book of God with a strength from Us, then recite it in such wise as to attract the hearts of those possessed of understanding. We have mentioned thee before, and at this time when the Wronged One walketh in this place which God hath made the most exalted of stations. Grieve not over anything, nor over what people say. Leave them to themselves and trust in God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken while in the Most Great Prison, surrounded by every heedless doubter.

God willing, thou wilt attract hearts and souls through the warmth of the Divine Word. By My life! We have mentioned thee with a mention whose fragrance shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure. Rejoice and be of those who are thankful. The manifestations of Satan have been and are lying in wait, and cawing and croaking have been and are being raised in every land.

It is well known and evident that he speaketh according to the Book. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid him in all conditions to serve Him and praise Him, for verily He is the Guardian of those who are nigh.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the Blessed Festivals, asking whether there are specific Tablets that must be recited for each of these Festivals, or whether any of the divine Tablets may be read - the recitation of verses during those days is beloved. The commandment of its obligation hath not been revealed, but the recitation of divine verses is assuredly beloved. Although specific Tablets have been revealed, the recitation of others is also beloved, for they have all been sent down from the presence of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the shroud, five full-length cloths have been ordained to be wrapped one over another, and in this Most Great Dispensation, a concession hath been granted to the poor, that they may use perfume and rose water in place of cedar water and camphor. These ordinances must be carried out with wisdom, and in the Holy Land, due to wisdom, these matters are still conducted according to the previous Law, for were it otherwise, the clamor of all would be raised, and this would be contrary to wisdom. In all things, observe wisdom. The law of prayer was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will some years ago, but it hath not yet been dispatched anywhere, lest it become a cause of trial for sanctified souls. The preservation of devoted souls taketh precedence with God over all deeds.\n\nI beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to assist you and to number you among the sincere ones in the Perspicuous Book. Furthermore, convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one to the friends and say: Today requireth a man of steel and a heart and vision that are illumined, lest he stumble in the Cause of God and be deprived of recognition and witnessing. Stand firm in the Cause through the All-Conquering, All-Powerful Name - a standing that all the world shall be powerless to prevent.

Today is the day for the manifestation of service, the manifestation of steadfastness, and the manifestation of remembrance. Deprive not yourselves of everlasting fruits. Strive that ye may attain unto the remembrance of God and His Word.

I ask of Him and beseech Him to answer, by virtue of His sovereign might, as one of His servants who was related to the Son had beseeched Him, that He may strengthen us in the face of oppressive onslaughts, for verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and that He may shelter us in the fortress of His favors, bounties and grace, and so forth.\n\nThy Lord hath answered all of this even before thy supplication, inasmuch as He hath aided thee to serve Him, to promulgate His Cause, and to mention His Name amongst His servants, and hath protected thee from the insinuations of the sinful and the doubts of the deniers, and hath made thee steadfast in times of trial and test. For such a Lord befitteth glorification, magnification and praise. He is, verily, the Mighty, the Peerless.\n\nThat which you had written concerning the circulation of copies of the Tablets was most pleasing. In truth, the divine Word is like the vernal breezes of God's tender mercy for all creation - the more it bloweth and passeth by, the sweeter and more excellent it becometh. This is of God's grace unto them. Previously certain Tablets were revealed to you wherein were recorded from the Pen of the Most High explanations regarding the revelation of certain verses of the Qur'an and some of the stories of the first believers. Those Tablets, nay rather all that hath been sent to you, should be dispatched to all lands, for they will prove most beneficial. Some of the servants are aware of what hath come to pass but know not what shall come to pass, therefore such Tablets will prove beneficial. Those to whom copies are sent should make copies thereof and send them to other regions. Although this wondrous Cause is one that hath no likeness in all that hath gone before or shall come after, blessed is he who beholdeth it with his own eyes, detached from all that he hath heard aforetime. In any case, befitting service to the Cause is expected of you; whatsoever you have done hath been and is acceptable.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about sending to the land of KH-R-T, by My life, We love to hear their call at all times. We have not forgotten them, but rather remember them as befitting and proper. Verily your Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. God willing, after the way is truly opened, We shall send to them that which will cause their spirits to soar and their eyes to be consoled. And regarding what you wrote about F-A-R-S, his book was presented at the Most Great Scene and an answer was revealed and sent. However, they must act with perfect wisdom. They must never explicitly speak of the Revealer and Sender. Most people are immature and as infants. When a child is born from its mother, it must be given milk, not meat and heavy foods, so that step by step it may be nurtured and reach a stage where it can partake of various fruits and manifold bounties. You must greatly emphasize concealment of the Cause, wisdom, and tolerance with people. Although teaching was commanded in the Tablet, this is not intended or desired in these days. They must act according to people's capacity. The more matters remain concealed in these days, the better. Previously a Tablet was specifically revealed for them but was not sent. We beseech God that he remain firm and steadfast. The ultimate bounty regarding him is that his mention was recorded by the Eternal Pen in the Divine Tablet. Blessed is he, again blessed is he. If at any time he intends to turn towards this land, you must surely prevent him. The explicit command is that no one should turn towards this direction except with his Lord's permission. Convey greetings from the True One to N-S. Say: God has seized him who cast you into the well. Verily He is the Deliverer of the lovers and the Destroyer of the idolaters. Likewise convey sublime greetings to Khalil of the land of S and Darvish and other loved ones of God, and especially to Aqa Muhammad-Rida who burns in the fire of separation, and convey countless greetings to his family. The Glory be upon you and upon those with you and your family.\n\nMay my spirit be sacrificed for You! A petition was submitted on Friday the tenth of this month, along with a copy of Your Tablet which had been sent previously, and likewise the sublime Tablet which was revealed and presented the night before the incident, a copy of which was written by Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, is being sent. The original Tablet was dispatched and the details were presented. God willing, it will reach Your most pure and luminous gaze.\n\nThe servant 66 \\[Allah\\].\n\nDated Thursday 16 Safar H.A.A.\n\n=== END BH00992 ===\n\n=== START BH00993 ===\n\nHe is God - exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!\n\nPraise be to God, and peace and blessings be upon the Prophets and Messengers, whom God made the manifestations of His Self, the dawning-places of His revelation, the recipients of His knowledge, the treasuries of the pearls of His recognition, and the repositories of His precious trusts; and upon their friends, their loved ones, and their children. Then effulgent, radiant, resplendent and brilliant blessings be upon their Lord, their Source, their Seal, their First and their Last, and upon His children and companions who forsook the world for the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nAnd then - my spirit be a sacrifice to your remembrance - the letter of that loved one was a lamp, bright and luminous to the heart, and through its contents joy and gladness were attained. After its reading and perusal it was presented before His presence. Likewise the letter of the beloved heart, his honor S.M., upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and also the letter of his honor Aqa Mirza Huda, upon him be \\[the Glory of God\\], which they had sent, were honored to be heard. May he, through divine grace, be blessed and may the Euphrates of mention and utterance in praise of the Beloved of the worlds flow and stream forth from the dawning-place of his words.\n\nHow many souls there are from whom whatever is imparted unto them is seen to be like an impenetrable rock, without effect or fruit; and how many souls there are who, upon merely hearing the rustling of the Divine Tree, are observed with sighs ascending and tears flowing. This is why He says: The companions of the right hand and the companions of the left hand are all seen today struck down by the blast of the trumpet, save whom God willeth. The effect of the trumpet has encompassed the world and all are observed as hollow palm-trunks. Beseech ye God that the Israfil of the spirit may breathe into the prostrate, lifeless temples a breathing whereby all may be adorned with the new and wondrous garment of life and may speak forth \"The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of all worlds.\"\n\nThis is the day when intoxication hath seized all. Blessed is the soul whom human conditions have not deprived of the Most Sublime Vision. Say: Remember thou Huda on behalf of the Wronged One and say: Blessed art thou in that thou hast turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon, and hast sought the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Summit, and the hosts of the heedless and the clamor of the turn-aways did not prevent thee. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: O my God! By Thy might and Thy majesty and Thy beauty and Thy tenderness and Thy mercy and Thy sovereignty, wert Thou to be mine I would be independent of the world, and were Thy glance to turn toward Thy servant I would ward off from me the oppression of the peoples. Thou art He Who created me and provided for me and made me manifest and nurtured me until Thou didst give me to drink, by the hands of Thy bounty, the cups of Thy recognition, in such wise that I turned unto Thee with my heart and my tongue spoke Thy praise and my face was set toward the horizon of Thy manifestation. O my Lord! Thou seest me cast out for Thy Name's sake and wandering through the lands in Thy path. I beseech Thee to confirm me in all conditions upon that which I have been, O Thou Possessor of Glory and Majesty, and Sovereign of Power and Grandeur! There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.\n\nThe End\n\nPraise be to God, they have attained His grace - glorified be His majesty - and have been mentioned at His threshold with such mention that every letter thereof testifies to His bounty, mercy and grace. God willing, may they attain unto this and be quickened by a new spirit from its breezes. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nThe beloved verses from the heart and soul of His Honor Shaykh, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, were presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold. He said: \"We have heard his prose in praise and remembrance of God, and likewise his poetry.\" The true lover hath at all times a state whose mention transcendeth the utterances of the people of the mortal realm. Praise be to God, the Euphrates of remembrance floweth from him and the nightingale of utterance warbleth upon the Lote-Tree of his heart. Verily We have remembered him with gracious mention and have sent down for him that which cooleth the eyes of the mystics. From this station We pronounce Our glorification upon him and send Our blessings upon those who have attained in the days of God and have held fast to His firm cord.\n\nThe poetry of my beloved, His Honor Haji Shaykh - upon him be the Glory of God and His grace - was in truth adorned with perfect joy and fragrance. It is as though the servant perceived from it the sweet-scented perfume of his sincerity unto God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. He beseecheth God for his assistance and success in the affairs of this world and the next. Verily He is powerful over all things. Blessed be he and joy be unto him.\n\nAnother matter to present is that there is a sum written somewhere which according to His command must reach His Honor S.M. - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - that they may deliver thirty (30) thereof to His Honor A., upon him be the Glory of God and His grace, and twenty (20) to His Honor Aqa Muhammad-Taqi \\[upon him be the Glory of God\\] to deliver to his father, making fifty tumans in total. Whenever received, let it be delivered.\n\nThe mention of His Honor A. and the loved ones - upon them be the peace \\[of God\\] - who are imprisoned for God and in His path, was made during nights and days at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold. This servant conveyeth his glorification and greetings unto them with the utmost humility and reverence. For God's sake is their essence, and for God's sake their acceptance, and for God's countenance their imprisonment. Blessed are they and blessed is he who remembereth them and loveth them in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nIn this blessed year, whosoever hath been subjected to hardship and tribulation hath been reckoned among the imprisoned ones. From this matter the divine favors toward the imprisoned ones are evident and manifest. Blessed are they that perceive and blessed are they that discern, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nIf answers to some of the loved ones have been or are delayed, there is no harm, for that eminent one is present and aware of the multitude of occupations, and above all is the consideration of wisdom according to the command of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, in these days that which is as antimony of jewels for the eye of the world and as a heart for its temple shall be sent. The command is God's, the Lord of creation.\n\nThe Servant\n\n17th of Muharram al-Haram 1301\n\n=== END BH00993 ===\n\n=== START BH00994 ===\n\nHe is the Most Wondrous in the Most Glorious Horizon!\n\nO My Name! Hearken unto the Call of God from the Dawning Place of every tongue: \"I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of the worlds!\" Then listen to that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of utterance by My Self, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate: \"Verily, there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Wise.\" Arise, then warn the servants of what they have neglected in regard to the Cause of God, then gladden them with the good pleasure of God, the Most High, the Almighty, the Great.\n\nSay: O people! Do ye marvel that the Beauty of the Most Exalted One hath come unto you once again in this radiant and luminous raiment? Say: In this Revelation are signs for those who are endued with insight, clear proofs for them that are near, and tokens for those who are possessed of discernment.\n\nO My Name! Turn thy face toward the Sacred Precinct. By God! This is verily the Sanctuary of God amongst you, the Sacred Domain in your midst, and the Scene of His Command between the heavens and the earth. Cast behind thee all names, place beneath thy feet all titles, and leave sovereignty to its people, for thy Lord desireth to behold thee stripped of all garments that He may attire thee with the ornament of His Cause amidst all the worlds.\n\nKnow thou that between Us and the servants there hath been set up a ladder having three steps. The first is associated with this world and its adornments, the second with the next world and what hath been ordained therein, and the third with the names and their kingdom. Whoso transcendeth these stations will attain unto the Sovereign of Names and Attributes more quickly than the twinkling of an eye. O people of Baha! Let not yourselves be detained at these waypoints, but pass beyond them as a cloud passeth by - thus doth it behoove Our near servants. And whoso passeth beyond them while remaining steadfast in My love, should he lift his head toward the heights, he will witness My Kingdom and hear My melodies, and be numbered among the successful ones.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Deprive not yourselves of the bounties of these days. Seize them, then await My Cause, the Dawning, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: Free yourselves, O people, then purify your souls from turning to aught else but Me. Through My remembrance is everything purified, if ye be of them that know. Say: Today, were all things to free themselves from the veils of self and desire, God would attire them all in the garment of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" in the kingdom of creation, that the sign of His sovereignty might be manifested in all things. Exalted be this Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nO servant! Read what hath reached thee of the signs of God with myriads of those who are nigh, that thou mayest be attracted thereby and attract through thy melodies the hearts of all created things. And whoso readeth the verses of God alone in his house, the angels that spread the divine fragrances will waft their perfume in all directions, and every pure soul will be transformed thereby, even though he may not be conscious of it at the time. Yet this grace will become manifest unto him in one of the days to come. Thus have the hidden mysteries of the Cause been ordained by the Ordainer, the Wise.\n\nO Khalil! By God! Even now doth the Pen move upon the Tablet, yet it weepeth and crieth out within itself, and with it doth the Lamp before the Throne lament by reason of what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty at the hands of those who were raised up through His Will - and God is witness unto this and knoweth it. And whoso purifieth his ears from the clamor of the idolaters and turneth toward all things will hear their wailing and their outcry at the tribulations We have suffered from Our idolatrous servants. Thus have We imparted unto thee a mention of Our tribulations that thou mayest become aware of what hath befallen My Self and be of them that are patient in what befalleth them. Aid thy Lord in every circumstance and be among the helpers. Then remind the people of that which the Spirit hath spoken in this luminous and perspicuous Tablet.\n\nSay: O people! Spread not corruption in the earth, nor wage war with anyone. Be patient in all things, place your trust in God, and be of them that trust in Him. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, with the swords of wisdom and utterance, for this befits human dignity. Naught else is worthy of God, the Glorified Sovereign, yet the people are heedless of this and are numbered with the negligent. O people! Open wide the portals of your hearts with the keys of remembrance through this All-Wise Remembrance. God desires naught from the earth and all that is therein save the hearts of His servants, which He hath made the throne for the manifestation of His revelations. Therefore, sanctify them from all else, that there may be impressed upon them that for which they were created. This verily is a great bounty.\n\nSay: O people! Adorn your tongues with truthfulness and your souls with trustworthiness. Beware, O people, lest ye act treacherously toward anyone. Be ye God's trustees amongst His creatures and be of the beneficent. They that commit oppression and wickedness - their efforts shall be brought to naught and they shall be numbered with the losers.\n\nStrive, O people, that your eyes may be directed towards the court of God's mercy, your hearts be mindful of the wondrous remembrances of Him, your souls be assured through His gifts and bounty, and your feet traverse the paths of His good-pleasure. This is My counsel unto you, if ye be of them that act. Whoso faileth to manifest the fragrances of the Cause and the traces of his Lord shall not be mentioned before God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nSay: In this Day, none shall be accounted as belonging to God and the Manifestation of His Self unless he becomes a standard of guidance among His servants, such that through his deeds the seekers may find guidance, the radiance of the All-Merciful may be witnessed in his countenance, and the remembrance of God, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, may be heard from his heart and tongue. Thus doth the Mighty Cause instruct you on this night wherein the Dove of the Cause warbleth sorrowful verses.\n\nKnow then, O thou who art assured of God, that thy Lord hath chosen thee for His love and hath favored thee in many ways. He hath delivered thee from heedlessness, aided thee to recognize His Self, preferred thee above many of His creatures, and made thee among them that know. He is aware of what hath befallen thee in His path and what hardships thou hast borne for His love and good-pleasure. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and not an atom's weight of the deeds of all creation escapeth the Tablet of His Decree. Well is it with thee for having shown patience in the days of God, for having attained unto them, and for being among them that comprehend. Therefore, strive within thyself to remain steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the utterances of the world cannot cause thee to slip. Then arise to praise thy Lord, convey His messages unto them that have believed in God and His signs, make them steadfast in His Cause, and be thou of the steadfast.\n\n=== END BH00994 ===\n\n=== START BH00995 ===\n\nObserve what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"No Messenger cometh unto them but they did mock Him.\" Likewise He saith: \"When Our clear signs came to them, they said: 'This is plain sorcery.'\" Adam came, and they denied Him. When it came to Moses' turn, the Pharaohs rejected Him. The Son of Mary appeared, and the learned among the idol-worshippers and the Jews objected and denied that Supreme Grace in such wise that were it to be mentioned, the lamentations of the world would be raised. And when the sweet savors of the All-Merciful wafted from the direction of Hijaz and the Day Star of Manifestation - the Seal of the Prophets - dawned from the horizon of Batha, the Jewish, Christian and idolatrous divines rose up in opposition and issued the verdict for the shedding of His most pure blood. In every age and cycle when the Sun of Truth hath shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, all have striven to extinguish its light, save whom God wished. And afterwards came the Herald, Who gave the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God to all. And when the appointed time arrived and the hidden, treasured Secret, which had been recorded by the Supreme Pen in all the divine Books, descended from the heaven of the Command with the banners of verses and standards of clear proofs, all denied Him. And the divines of Persia - the Shi'ih sect - perpetrated that which no other sect had ever done, and committed that which caused the clouds to cry out and the heavens to wail. From the beginning until now, He hath been in the hands of His enemies - at times imprisoned in the land of Ta under chains and fetters, at times in other lands under the claws of the wicked. Finally, they carried Him as a captive from land to land until they assigned Him to this Most Great Prison and Most Mighty Stronghold. I swear by the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance that in all conditions We have been and are thankful. Divine love transformeth hardship into ease and severity into relief. Tribulation in His path is acceptable and beloved by the lovers and the eager ones. The sincere and near ones have freely sacrificed and continue to sacrifice their lives in the path of the Beloved of the worlds.\n\nReflect upon his honor the martyr who was named 'Ali in the Kingdom of Names. By the life of God, he proceeded to the place of sacrifice with such joy and eagerness that the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the Highest Garden all proclaimed \"Well done, O 'Ali!\" The holy ones of Paradise came forth to welcome him, and all remembered him, saying \"Enter, enter, O 'Ali!\" Were this station to be revealed, all would abandon the world and whatsoever is therein, and would turn unto that which is with God.\n\nO Siyyid 'Ali, upon thee be My glory! Thy name hath been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and this perspicuous Tablet hath dawned for thee specifically from the horizon of the grace of the Lord of the worlds. Give thanks to the Desired One of the world for this great bounty. Convey My greetings and praise to the loved ones of God and say: O people of God! Today the call of the Divine Lote Tree and the trilling of the Supreme Pen are raised. The ocean of utterance surgeth before the faces of all peoples, and the sun of knowledge shineth from the horizon of will. Hold fast unto truth and be free from all else. The opposers and barking ones have intended to lead the servants astray. Protect yourselves through the name of Truth. It may well be that from this land too there will arise one who barketh. We beseech God to set ablaze the friends of that land with the fire of the divine Lote Tree and illumine them with the light of His Cause, that all may attain unto supreme steadfastness and pass by all else save God like unto lightning. O people of God! The Shi'ih sect counted themselves as the most learned, the most enlightened and the most excellent among all the peoples of the world, yet on the Day of Judgment they were seen to be the most lost among the nations. This loss proceeded from the divines, for in ages past they educated the people in vain imaginings, and even now they await the emergence of an imaginary one from an imaginary city. Such is the state of the divines of the past. O Siyyid 'Ali! When thou hast received My Tablet and inhaled the fragrance of My utterance, say: My God, my God, my Goal, my Beloved, my Worshipped One, my Hope, my Desire and my Refuge! I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which the ocean of knowledge surged in the contingent world and the horizon of utterance was illumined by the sun of proof, to aid me in Thy remembrance, Thy praise and the service of Thy loved ones. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy most exalted horizon, acknowledging Thy oneness and Thy singleness, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! I testify that through Thy manifestation the decree of resurrection was revealed, the Hour came to pass, the mountains were moved, the Trumpet was blown, and all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save those whom Thou didst deliver through Thy bounty and shelter beneath the pavilions of Thy grace. O Lord! Separation from Thee hath caused my death, and my liver hath melted from remoteness from the court of Thy nearness. I beseech Thee by the power through which Thou didst transform remoteness into nearness and darkness into light, to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones. Then cause me, O my God, to be so set ablaze with the fire of Thy love that Thy servants may be enkindled thereby. O Lord! Thou seest mine eyes fixed upon the horizon of Thy bounty, my outer and inner hands raised toward the heaven of Thy mercy, and my heart turned toward Thy direction. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Abraham prevailed over Nimrod, Moses over Pharaoh, and Muhammad over Abu-Jahl, to enable me to do that which befitteth Thy days and beseemeth Thy Cause. Then forgive, O my God, Thy loved ones whose hearts were troubled in adversity and who were seized with fear in times of trials. Then adorn them with the ornament of Thy pardon and bounty, and ordain for them the reward of what they have wrought in Thy path and that which beseemeth the heavens of Thy favors and the suns of Thy gifts. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At the end of the Book, We counsel the friends of that land to love the kindred of the Martyr, upon him and upon them be the glory of God, His light, and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00995 ===\n\n=== START BH00996 ===\n\nThis is what was sent down to the noble one from the land of Mim who was martyred in the land of Ta with a martyrdom at which the Concourse on High was amazed and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise lamented, and to the noble souls who spent what they possessed and their very lives in the path of God, the Lord of earth and heaven. In the name of the Most Holy, the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nThe first fragrance wafting from the garment of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness, the first sweet savors diffused from the gardens of divine knowledge, and the first breeze that stirred from the right hand of the Throne be upon thee, O Mystery of Names and Hidden Secret of the Cause in the Kingdom of Eternity! I testify that thou didst turn to the Supreme Horizon when the people of creation turned away from it, and the call of the Creator of Heaven attracted thee in such wise that thou didst seek the ultimate goal and the highest summit, and didst attain unto that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an on the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of all religions. I testify that thou didst find the fragrance of the Days and didst drink the choice wine of divine knowledge from the hand of bounty of Him in Whose grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, and didst attain unto that which was recorded in the Books of God and hidden in His knowledge. Blessed is he who seeketh to attain thy station, turneth toward thy direction, and visiteth thy resting-place. Thou art he who attained the presence of the Day wherein was heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the scratching of the Supreme Pen, and thou wert among those whom God had formerly given glad tidings through His words: \"Lead forth the people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.\" I testify that thou didst hear the call of the Trumpet when it was sounded, and didst see the earth when it was illumined by the light of its Lord, and didst hear its call when it told of its tidings. Thou art he whom the signs and portents of the Hour did not frighten; thou didst comprehend them, attain unto their sweet savors, and turn toward them when those on earth turned away from their Manifestation, save whom God, their Creator and their Sovereign, willed. Thou art he who attained unto the flowing waters of mercy when their murmur was raised, and unto the call of the Lote-Tree when its rustling was heard, and remained steadfast when the limbs of all beings trembled with fear of the Days, and responded when God's call was raised on the Day of Resurrection. Thou art he through whom the lips of utterance smiled in the realm of possibility and the pavilions of grandeur were raised upon the highest standards. Thou art he who attained unto the lights of the Sun of inner meanings when it shone forth from its horizon and unto the Living Waters when they flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, and stood firm when the dwellers of the graves arose and witnessed when the decree of resurrection was manifest. I testify that thy foot did not slip, thy countenance did not change, and thy heart was not troubled when earthquakes seized all the tribes of the earth, save whom God, the Lord of Names, willed. Thou wert successful in attaining the ocean of certitude when the people wandered in the wilderness of idle fancies. Thou art he who found the sweet savors of the Supreme Word and the Most Exalted Paradise before all things, and saw what was veiled, and knew what was hidden, and believed in Him Who was promised in God's Books and recorded in His Scrolls and Scriptures. Through thee and thy like was opened the door of grace unto the face of the world and was raised the standard of justice among the nations, and through your submissiveness did necks bow down on the Day of the Covenant and the horizons became illumined with the light of unity. Through you appeared God's straight path and His firm and mighty Command, and through you surged the ocean of utterance amidst all possibility and the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted over all lands. Ye are the dawning-places of the light of oneness and the treasuries of God's conclusive wisdom and the keys to the doors of knowledge and the Law. Ye are God's party and His hosts and God's balance and His justice. Through you did lights shine forth and mysteries were unveiled and the clouds rained down and the decree of the Book was established. Ye are God's Books among His creation and His Scrolls among His servants, and ye are the pearls of the ocean of knowledge and the dawning-places of the Cause amidst all possibility. Through you was adorned the preamble of the Book of munificence and the opening of the gates of munificence upon all in the unseen and visible realms. Alas, alas, for what hath befallen you at the hands of the most loss-laden on the Day of Judgment. By your tribulation did the Faithful Spirit lament and chosen servants cry out, the leaves of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing turned yellow, eyes in the Most Exalted Paradise wept, the pillars of the Primal Word were shaken, and the hearts of the dwellers of the pavilion of glory were disturbed upon the luminous spot. Through what befell you were the pillars of the Throne shaken, the companions of the Crimson Ark upon the sea of names were struck with terror, and darkness seized all who dwell on earth and in heaven. In grief for you did the Maids of Paradise leave their chambers and turn toward you, and we lament for you. In sorrow for you wept the eyes of the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and those who dwell in the canopies of grandeur beyond the sea of glory. Through your tribulation did every possessor of a homeland become a stranger, every station was brought low, every tranquil soul was troubled, every patient one cried out, every knower was thunderstruck, and every life was transformed. I testify that through your afflictions was the mountain of generosity swept away from among the world, and the Manifestations of eternity were cut off from life among the nations.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Thou seest the temples of them that love Thee cast upon the dust, with none to comfort them save the breezes of Thy mercy that pass over them at dawn and lament for them in such wise as to melt the very stones. The sweetness of Thy call so transported them that they detached themselves from the world, turning to Thy most exalted horizon. These are servants who remained faithful to Thy Covenant and Testament, who hastened to the station of sacrifice in hope of what lieth with Thee, and in whom Thy most exalted Word had such effect that their hearts were melted thereby, their eyes shed tears, and their necks bowed before Thy grandeur. These are honored servants who strove in Thy path with true striving and aided Thy Cause with true aid. The hosts of earth prevented them not from turning to Thee, nor did the might of kings frighten them from manifesting Thy sovereignty among Thy creatures. They arose and spoke that which made the skin of the oppressors shudder and the pillars of the transgressors quake.\n\nO Lord! I beseech Thee by them, by their sighs and tears in their longing and yearning, that Thou forgive me and my parents and whosoever hath turned unto Thee, O Lord of the Covenant, on the Day of Separation. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by this most pure sepulcher and this hallowed and purified dust, that Thou ordain for this servant of Thine, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiver, the Munificent, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\n=== END BH00996 ===\n\n=== START BH00997 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the One, the Single!\n\nO friends of the Beauty of the All-Merciful! Without concealment or veiling, He hath risen from the horizon of creation, manifest and evident, in such wise that none possessed of sight hath any excuse to deny Him, save such as are unworthy to behold the Most Great Countenance. Even as is witnessed, the Sun shineth resplendent, yet the blind one remaineth deprived and bereft of beholding it. How blessed, then, are they who in this Day gaze upon the Most Pure Station and the Most Great Countenance. By the lights of the Morn of sanctification! These are they who are accounted more precious than the most precious ruby.\n\nThe winds of trials and tests have ever blown, and shall continue to blow, from the dawning-place of the justice of the All-Merciful, that the one who turneth away may be distinguished from the one who advanceth. Yet blessed are they who remain unperturbed when these winds blow. We did aforetime warn all people of the days of hardship and their tribulations, that perchance when the winds of destiny stirred they would not be deprived of turning toward the Friend, and would protect the lamp of divine love with the glass of trust and detachment from diverse winds. Nevertheless, when they descended, most people were heedless, save whom thy Lord willed, to such extent that broken glasses, extinguished lamps, troubled hearts, and wavering souls were witnessed.\n\nYet this is most evident, that the beauty of the spirit and its worth lie in its being spent in the path of the Friend. Blessed is the soul that spendeth and the Friend accepteth. Since the eye of the heart remaineth veiled by the veils of self and desire, it hath therefore been deprived of perceiving this station. Were a soul to gaze with the most pure vision, it would gladly sacrifice a hundred thousand lives.\n\nGod willing, all must remain so steadfast in the path of God's Cause that the opposition and objection of all on earth shall not cause them to slip. In times when the winds of tests blow, the lovers of the Beauty of the All-Merciful are distinguished from the people of loss, and they who remain steadfast in these days are accounted before God among the people of the shadowless Paradise and are so recorded.\n\nThis Sublime, Most Exalted, Most Holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful's Will specifically for the people of the village of Zirak. The Leaf of Paradise, that is, the Sister of the Bab, should seek out Mulla Muhammad and the companions of that village and read it to them.\n\nO ye beloved of God! Hearken unto His call from the Prison, and seek at all times refuge in God, that ye may be protected from the evil of these days and from that which appeareth therein from the manifestations of Satan. The glance of God's loving-kindness hath ever been and shall ever be directed towards you. Be not grieved during these few fleeting days, but occupy yourselves with His remembrance and praise, and be joyous in His remembrance. Move amongst men with godly qualities, that all people may inhale His fragrances from your deeds, acts and words, and turn towards the Friend. Every tree must yield befitting and worthy fruit, for if a tree beareth no fruit, it is fit only for the fire, and so shall it ever be. Therefore must the trees of human souls in this divine springtime bring forth wondrous fruits. The fruit of these trees hath ever been and shall ever be the knowledge of God and goodly deeds that are pleasing unto Him. God willing, ye must all be adorned with the ornament of detachment, and in this springtime of the All-Merciful be honored with the robe of acceptance, and remain not deprived of the Salsabil of His grace and favor. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings that a gate of Paradise hath been opened such as was not opened before and shall not be opened hereafter. Therefore know ye the value of these days and be ye detached from all save God, in such wise that none shall be able to exercise influence over your hearts. For in these days the holy and divine Manifestations appear with utmost sanctity and detachment, and likewise the manifestations of Satan are visible with the utmost deceit and guile, moving among men in human form. Therefore turn ye unto God, that through His grace and mercy ye may be protected from the evil of such degenerate and whispering souls. If ye apprehend the realm of existence and immortality, ye will not be disturbed and shaken by the outward non-existence and extinction in the path of the Friend. Set not your hearts upon this narrow, transient space; soar in the unlimited atmosphere of the spirit, until ye arrive at a station wherein ye shall behold the entire world and its people as non-existent and extinct. The breezes of grace are wafting from the right hand of the Throne of the All-Merciful with such power that were the peoples of the world to turn to them but slightly, all would be purified from the defilement of this transient world and would return to the Most Pure Horizon. How unfortunate are the souls who in these days remain heedless and deprived! And ye, O friends, praise ye the Beloved of all creation, in that the winds of His grace have passed over you and guided you to the City of His Oneness. Know ye then the value of this bounty and be ye occupied at all times with His praise. All matters are visible in His presence, and He is aware of the hearts of His loved ones. He is, verily, knowing of all things. We beseech God to protect you from the evil of those who have disbelieved, and to give you to drink from the cup of His love at all times. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! These are Thy servants who have turned to the effulgent rays of Thy countenance and who are illumined by the manifestations of the glory of Thy divine unity in Thy days. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which trembling seized the whole creation and intoxication overtook those servants who were heedless of Thy remembrance and Thy meeting, and by which the sincere ones arose to celebrate Thy praise and glorification, not to deprive these souls of the breathings of Thy revelation and inspiration, and the manifestations of the glory of Thy divine unity and the evidences of Thy holy oneness. Moreover, O my God, guard them from the darts of doubts and the arrows of allusions, and purify them with the Kawthar of Thy favors and the Tasnim of Thy gifts, that they may move only by Thy leave and command, and speak naught except in praise of the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted and Most Glorious Self. Verily, Thou art the One Who doeth whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Compelling, the All-Glorious, the All-Choosing.\n\n=== END BH00997 ===\n\n=== START BH00998 ===\n\nHe is God - exalted be His glory, to Him belong greatness and majesty!\n\nPraise sanctified above the comprehension of all the first and the last befitteth the Lord of the Day of Judgment, Who hath spoken forth the Most Exalted Word, and through that Word raised high the banner of knowledge in the world of existence and unfurled the standard of being, and through that Word made manifest the ocean of divine knowledge and caused the waves of utterance to surge, upon which dependeth the existence of the world. None hath ever attained to the true understanding of that Word as it truly is. From but a single point thereof hath appeared the knowledge of all the first and the last. He is the Dawning-Place of the divine Books, the Day-spring of the revelation of the Lord of Oneness, and the Source of divine laws and ordinances. His are the four pillars, in each pillar lie hidden mysteries and treasured bounties. And when that Point bowed down before the effulgences of the lights of the Most Great Name, the Hand of His grace adorned it with the ornament of nearness and reunion, and from it appeared \"B\" which was joined unto \"H\", and through this Point all things proclaimed \"The Truth is come!\"\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Creator of the Point, its Ordainer, its Adorner, its Protector and its Helper! I bear witness unto that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath testified when Thou wert seated upon the throne of divine expression in the midst of all possibilities, and I acknowledge that which hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen amidst all created things. I beseech Thee by the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge and the verses treasured in Thy tablets, and by Thy Command through which the limbs of all names trembled while the hearts of the people of Baha were assured, to send down upon him who hath turned unto Thee and held fast unto Thee, from the heaven of Thy mercy, the rain of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and King of eternity, by the fragrant breezes of Thy verses and the lights of the dawn of Thy Manifestation, and by Thy breezes through which the dwellers of the graves arose, and by Thy signs through which was revealed the decree of resurrection and the trump was blown, to make me steadfast in Thy remembrance and praise, firm in Thy love, seeking refuge in Thy presence, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. Thou art He Whom neither the happenings of the world nor the doubts of nations have hindered. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nMoreover, I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, to assist the people of Baha to remain steadfast in Thy love, such that neither the oppression of the tyrants nor the rejection of the transgressors who have ascended the pulpits in Thy name and uttered concerning Thee that which caused the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy majesty and the tabernacle of Thy glory to lament - after Thou hadst created them for Thy remembrance and praise - may frighten them. Thou art He Who hath seen and heard what they have spoken thereon in Thy days, and Thou didst forbear despite Thy power and conceal despite Thy might. O Lord! Aid Thy heedless servants to behold that which hath appeared from Thee and to turn unto Thy horizon. Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all and Whose grace hath encompassed all, and Who hath named Thyself the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nO Lord! Ordain for Thy loved ones the good of the hereafter and of this world. There is no God but Thee, the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below. Then forgive them through Thy bounty which hath preceded existence itself. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Lord! Thou seest Thy male and female servants turning unto Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by Thy name, the All-Forgiving, to forgive them through Thy bounty and generosity, and by Thy name, the Most Generous, to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nO Jalal! We have heard the call of My loved ones, both men and women. Convey My greetings to them and remind them of My verses, and give them the glad tidings of My mercy which has preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Jalal! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nYour letters, both past and present, have been received. Every word thereof testified to your acceptance, devotion and steadfastness. O Jalal! This Day is unlike other days and its utterance unlike other utterances. Whosoever attains unto the fragrances of the Most Exalted Word which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the prison of Akka, and recognizes it, will become detached from the world and all that dwell therein, and will cleave with heart and soul unto the Truth. Blessed are they whom the veils of the world have not hindered and whom the doubts of the nations have not prevented from turning towards and accepting the Truth.\n\nPraise be to God that thou hast sought the Most Great Ocean and hast attained unto that which hath been revealed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days in the Books of the nations. Thou didst arrive, thou didst see, thou didst hear the Call, thou didst behold the horizon, and thou didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Blessed art thou and blessed are My friends in Nun and Ya who have not broken My covenant and My testament, who have drawn nigh and have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hands of My bounty. We have remembered them before and remember them now that this remembrance may attract them to the Greater Steadfastness, lest their feet slip from the Path of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nConvey My greetings to all and give them the glad tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Today the call of the servants hath been heard, and the answer is at all times being revealed from the horizon of the Kingdom of utterance.\n\nThe honored Ismu'llah, upon him be My glory, hath repeatedly mentioned both thee and Mulla Shafi', and in each instance he hath been blessed with the revelation of the Supreme Pen. This Wronged One hath ever remembered and will continue to remember His loved ones. I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of Revelation that every name that is mentioned in the presence of this Wronged One is blessed with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. The world hath not been, nor is it now, capable of manifesting the stations of His loved ones. Great is the endeavor and mighty the steed, but the field is not spacious enough. We beseech God - and ye should likewise beseech Him - not to deprive His servants and to grant them a portion of the bounties of these days. He is the Generous One Who hath created the world for His servants. It behooveth the tongues of them that are nigh unto Him and are sincere in their love to be engaged day and night in His praise and glorification. This is meet for those who have turned unto Him and have perceived the fragrance of His utterance and the sweetness of His remembrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\n=== END BH00998 ===\n\n=== START BH00999 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory in greatness and power!\n\nPraise be unto the Desired One, whose purpose hath ever been the salvation and protection of His servants, and whose laws and commandments have each been, in the eyes of them that are endowed with insight, a vigilant guardian that slumbereth not - each a mighty fortress and an impregnable stronghold. Exalted be His favors, all-encompassing His dominion, and manifest His grace, His mercy and His loving-kindness! And peace and blessings be upon the Source of existence, through whom were illumined the realms of hearts and minds and the cities of justice, and without whom neither would the world have come into being nor would laws and ordinances have been established among the peoples. Through Him did the river of mercy flow, the sweet savors of grace were wafted, and the waters proclaimed: \"He Who is the Lord of Names hath come!\" and the dust proclaimed: \"The Lord of all men hath come!\" and all things proclaimed: \"The kingdom belongeth unto God, Creator of heaven!\" And peace be upon His family and companions, through whom appeared the proof and was made manifest the way, and through whom shone forth the light of unity amongst kings and servants, and through whom all things were given the glad-tidings of victory and triumph, and the limbs of every polytheist who turned away and denied were made to quake.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Thy letter, like a spiritual fragrance, bestowed spirit and joy upon the carpet of the soul and transformed the gloom of these days into gladness. Praise be to God that the effects of thy spirit-stirring pen proclaim \"verily, I am ever in communion.\" God knoweth that its appearance, its arrival, its perusal, and its influence are each a perfect bounty and an outpouring mercy, for every letter thereof is a volume in praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory. And afterward, having sought audience, it was presented before the face of the Lord, Who said: \"O Muhammad, upon thee be the peace of God!\"\n\nThere hath befallen this Wronged One that which hath no end to its sorrow and which hath prevented the pen from writing and the tongue from speaking. Night and day have the rains of counsel poured down unremittingly from the heaven of love, yet no trace was seen from what was spoken nor fruit from what was sown. How many seeds of mature wisdom were imprisoned in barren soil! In that great city there were two souls, one \"M\" and one \"S\", each counting themselves among the people of knowledge, faith, certitude, steadfastness and detachment. But in the end the opposite became evident and manifest, and they became the cause of the waste of the Cause in that city. Some imagined that a door of bounty had been opened and a place of justice and fairness established, the result of which would be the manifestation of human qualities and praiseworthy spiritual characteristics. But that which appeared caused the form of justice to tremble and the tears of fairness to flow. More than this cannot be said. In any case, the true cause and reason was a single soul. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to make known to them that which harmeth and benefiteth them. Verily, He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer.\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones of that land. Praise be to God that from that company wafteth the sweet fragrance of love and spreadeth pleasing perfumes. We beseech God to increase each day their unity, harmony, humility and submissiveness, that all may become as one soul in educating the servants and refining the people of the land. Verily, He is the Answerer of prayers and the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nWhat can this servant say? In these days a sorrow has come to pass the like of which has never been seen. One for whom the utmost love, favor and grace was shown, and for whom the means of trade were arranged, has been so consumed by the fire of jealousy that day and night he has devoted all effort against his own brother. They see no one without whispering evil words about his brother into their ear. In short, to the learned and ignorant, those within and without, friends and strangers, he has said that which has caused the servants to withdraw and avoid. Thus order in affairs has been scattered and total loss has become manifest. In one of the Tablets these blessed words were revealed from the tongue of the Master: \"He made peace with the enemy and assailed the friend, and did not manifest the name of the Concealer.\" End quote.\n\nThis servant beseeches God to raise up in that city one who will make amends for what has been lost and wasted. Glory is in His hand and power in His mighty grasp. Verily He is the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about Aqa 'Ali, upon him be God's peace, that a portion of his money should be taken out and put in the name of the house door - after submission they said: \"We have accepted his love and kindness, but if it reverts to himself it would be better, since until now no profit has appeared from the trades. Therefore it is best that it revert to him until God brings His grace, generosity and bounty.\" And likewise regarding what you wrote about the funds, as commanded, whatever way they deem advisable to act is acceptable. However they said that now all attention must be on external affairs, meaning endeavoring to pay external debts. I beseech God that His grace may encompass and His bounty become manifest. He is the Hearer and the Powerful.\n\nTo each of the friends in that land I offer greetings. Praise be to God, until now they have been the cause of exaltation and elevation, and this matter has certainly been and will be the cause of the descent of grace, blessing and mercy. Verily He is with His sincere servants, His righteous servants, His detached servants, those who are certain, those who are steadfast. And peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you and upon those servants whom nothing whatsoever has prevented from drawing near unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Exalted Seat.\n\n=== END BH00999 ===\n\n=== START BH01000 ===\n\nThe Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted\n\nThis is a remembrance from Our presence to people who hear, and wisdom from Us to people who understand, and light from the horizon of the Cause to people who see. This is the countenance of God, if you would turn to it. This is the Temple of the Cause, if you would accept it. This is the horizon of Revelation, if you would behold it. This is verily the Dawning-Place of inspiration, if you would perceive it. Say: This is the Fire through which all things were stirred and ascended unto God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. This is the Word through which was created what was and what will be. This is the fragrance through which the world was perfumed, if you would discover it. These are the winds through which the gardens of hearts were made verdant, if you would know. This is the Hand which emerged from the bosom of grandeur and power and encompassed all that is seen and unseen. This is He Who cannot be known through aught else - behold Him, O people, through His own eyes and follow not every rejected liar.\n\nSay: This is the righteousness of God which you were promised in a hidden Tablet, and this is the Temple built by the hands of your Lord's power, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: This is He but for Whom the verses would not have been revealed nor would every decreed matter have appeared. This is He Whom the Desired One of the world intended, while you are as dead. This is He to Whom the tongue of grandeur calls out, indicating: \"This, verily, is the Beloved of God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.\" Yet ignorant servants denied Me and broke God's covenant - verily they are bewildered. They cast aside the All-Knowing and took hold of vain imaginings - verily they are a people who deny. They turned away from the ocean and approached the pond - they do not understand. Thus has the Most Exalted Pen raised its cry between earth and heaven. Blessed is he who turned to it with the ear of innate nature - verily he is of the triumphant ones. Arise to the Cause through God's might and power. Say: O people! The veil has been rent asunder and the Bestower has come with a manifest proof. All that appears from Him is evidence, if you be of those who know. He calls, at all times, all who are in the realm of possibility, yet people are in a mighty veil. Among them is he who was veiled by remembrances until he opposed the Chosen One and was of the opposers. And among them is he who clung to tales of the past and spoke that which caused the hearts of those near to God to burn. And among them is he who said \"He has not yet thus revealed Himself in those days\" and was of the heedless. Say: I have not revealed Myself, but God has revealed all things, if you be of those who know. Say: Were you to ponder what you oppose, you would find it a proof and evidence for Him Who has come with the truth by a clear command. Can the clamor of these people prevent Him? No, by His own Self, the Truth! He speaks what He is commanded by One knowing and wise. Say: He has come with power and sovereignty that none in the worlds can prevent. Through Him has shone the sun of Will and through Him has appeared God's decree, the Mighty, the Generous. Thus have We recounted to thee the conditions of the servants that thou might become aware of what has befallen Us from the hosts of the polytheists. They hasten to the fire while supposing it to be light. Say: No, by His sovereignty which encompasses all in the heavens and earths! This is the Manifestation which you were promised in the Tablets. He has come at an hour none among the people perceived, and thy Lord is witness to what I say. Say: It is the Hour at which the Hour was shaken and the Resurrection wailed, if you be of those who hear.\n\nThe Cause is mighty, mighty! None can bear it save the people of Baha who have cast aside the world and are of the detached. When thou hast attained unto God's verses and known the conditions of the leaves, say: Praised be Thee, O Thou Who didst remember me when I was in the prison of the idolaters. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist me to arise to serve Thy Cause, to stand firm in Thy love, and to turn towards the horizon of Thy favors. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nConvey my greetings unto My loved ones who have stood firm in the Cause and abided by that which was enjoined upon them from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: By the Lord of the Great Throne, ye are the triumphant ones, and by the Lord of the Exalted Seat, ye are the spring breezes. Ye are they who have quaffed this pure wine which was unsealed in the name of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Ye are they who speak that which your Ancient Lord hath desired, and ye are the witnesses this Day, while all others are in strange concealment. Thus doth the All-Merciful testify for you, and nothing created on earth can equal this. Every discerning soul beareth witness thereunto. Verily, they who are remote this Day are among the dead. They have not drunk of the water of life and they abide forever in the graves of ignorance.\n\nArise to assist the Cause of your Lord in such wise that the affairs of men shall not grieve you, nor shall the doubts of the heedless hinder you. Be ye the helpers of God in His lands and the emblems of His might amongst His servants, that the people of the earth may find in you that whereby their souls may be assured and the hearts of the hesitant ones be set ablaze. Remember God in your homes, and He will remember you in this mighty Prison.\n\nBe not disturbed by those who have wronged Us. Soon shall We seize them as We seized the transgressors before them who transgressed against God in those regions. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Determiner. He who pronounced judgment against Us hath been seized by the breaths of chastisement from every direction. He is, verily, the most severe of revengers. Thus was it revealed in the Tablet of the Heart when the Ancient Beauty arrived at the Most Great Prison. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Were it not for thy Lord's mercy, thou wouldst find those on earth as a handful of dust, but My mercy hath preceded My servants; therefore have We left them to themselves until the appointed time.\n\nSay: Glory be unto Thee, O God, in Whose right hand are the reins of all created things, and in Whose grasp is the kingdom of earth and heaven. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance, whereby the horizons were illumined, to send down upon us from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw us nigh unto the ocean of Thy favors and make us to be of those whom the blame of the blamer hath not kept back from turning toward Thy face, nor hath the clamor of the infidels deterred from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. I beseech Thee not to withhold us from that Ocean which hath surged through Thy Name and been exalted through Thy Command. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of names. There is none other God but Thee, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\n=== END BH01000 ===\n\n=== START BH01001 ===\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of the world and the Ruler of the nations! I testify that Thou hast from eternity been sanctified above the mention of all created things and exalted beyond the loftiest descriptions of Thy creatures. Whensoever Thy devoted servants sought to ascend unto the station of Thy recognition, the hosts of Thy knowledge barred their way; and whensoever Thy near ones desired to gain admittance to the heaven of Thy nearness, the overpowering majesty of Thine utterance kept them back. We bear witness that the loftiest of the divine names are but servants at Thy door, and that their most glorious manifestations bow down before Thy countenance and are humbled in Thy presence. Thou art, in truth, He Who can neither be described in letters, nor evoked by words, nor even contained within the hidden meanings they conceal. For these are all circumscribed by the inherent limitations of speech which characterize all the utterances of the peoples of the world.\n\nExalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the mention of every soul and the understanding of every heart! Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the description of anyone save Thyself and beyond every conception of Thy creatures! Were Thine own Manifestations to soar upon the wings of the seen and the unseen, yet would they fail to attain unto the first effulgence shining from the horizon of Thy most exalted Countenance and the dawning-place of Thy most sublime Revelation. And were the Exponents of Thy Lordship enabled to ascend for as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven endure, yet would they be forever powerless to draw nigh unto the Day-Star of Thy beauty.\n\nBlessed be the one who comprehendeth Thine enduring reality and the evanescence of all else but Thee, and who acknowledgeth Thy sovereign authority and the powerlessness of all save Thyself. And as the evanescence of all things is established before the surging ocean of Thy remembrance, O King of all names, it likewise becometh evident that their every mention and description falleth short of Thy might and grandeur and ill beseemeth Thy loftiness and power. And yet in spite of this, O my God, Thou hast, out of the wonders of Thy grace and munificence and as a token of Thy bounty and Thy favour, enjoined upon all to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, and hast accepted their glorification of Thee out of Thy grace and generosity. Wherefore doth Thine own Self call on Thy Self and Thy very Essence invoke Thine Essence on behalf of Thy lovers who have borne every hardship in Thy path and every adversity out of love for Thee and contentment with Thy good-pleasure, in this blessed day which Thou hast made to be a festival for the inmates of Thy kingdom and for those who have kept the Fast by Thy command and obeyed Thy resistless decree.\n\nExalted be this blessed and glorious day which Thou hast designated by that beloved Name which is both hidden and manifest, and which, when it shone forth above the horizon of eternity, the Divine Lote-Tree called out, saying: \"By God! The Lord of creation hath come, Whom no name can describe.\" Whereupon Paradise was set astir and proclaimed with joy and fervour: \"O concourse of the world! He hath come, round Whom circle the Daysprings of the All-Merciful, the Manifestations of the All-Praised, and the Dawning-Places of inspiration.\" And all things cried aloud: \"This is that Tablet with which the kingdom of creation hath been adorned and through which the gate leading unto the Divine Presence hath been flung open unto all who are in heaven and on earth.\" Happy the one who hath forsaken every desire and hath drawn nigh unto the One Whose reality no word or utterance can convey.\n\nBy God! This is the Day whereon from the murmur of the waters can be heard: \"No God is there but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting\", and from the whispering of whose breezes can be heard: \"No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved\", and from the rustling of whose trees can be heard: \"No God is there but Him, the Most Powerful, the Ever-Giving, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving\", and beyond them, from the Tongue of Grandeur can be heard: \"This is the Day of the appearance of Him Who is manifest yet hidden, Who is visible yet concealed. Hasten unto Him, O ye who are the daysprings of the divine names, and draw nigh unto Him, O ye who dwell in the kingdom of creation, with hearts that have been purified from superstitions and vain imaginings and sanctified from the idle talk of men!\"\n\nImmeasurably exalted is the state of Thy loved ones who have clung to the cord of Thy command, held fast to the hem of Thine ordinances, uttered that which hath been permitted unto them in Thy Tablets, transgressed not the bounds ordained in Thy Book, and spoken out in Thy lands with wisdom as decreed in the scrolls of Thy bounty and the epistles of Thy grace. O Lord! Assist them to arise for the triumph of Thy Cause through what Thou hast expounded unto them with Thy most exalted Pen and what Thou hast instructed them in certain of Thy Tablets. O Lord! Leave them not to themselves, but keep them safe through Thy sovereignty and power and assist them through Thy might and bounty.\n\nO Lord! They are Thy servants and bondsmen who have believed in Thee and have drawn nigh unto the heaven of Thy bounty. Suffer them not to be deprived of the tokens of Thy tender mercies in Thy days; neither do thou withhold from them the fragrance of the roses of Thy wisdom. Guide them then, O my God, to the ocean of Thy good-pleasure, that in Thy Name they may immerse themselves therein, and that they may not be saddened by that which their own minds have conceived, nor grieved by all that they have witnessed in Thy path. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful One Whose might every powerful one hath recognized, Whose sovereignty every possessor of majesty hath acknowledged, before the waves of the ocean of Whose knowledge every learned one confesseth his ignorance, and before the evidences of Whose power every soul endued with strength admitteth his helplessness.\n\nThou art the One, O my God, to Whom every name is abashed to be related, and in Whose presence all things shrink for shame from being mentioned. From eternity Thou hast dwelt in those transcendent heights that are exalted above all mention and description. How great are Thy sovereignty and Thy power and how mighty Thy grandeur!--this, though all things acknowledge that Thou art entirely sanctified from, and immeasurably exalted above, all but Thine own Self. Thou hast subdued the entire world through a single Word that hath been related to the kingdom of Thine utterance and from which the fragrance of the robe of Thy Command hath been wafted.\n\nO Lord of all being and Educator of all things visible and invisible! Grant us ears that are pure, hearts that are sanctified, and eyes that see, so that we may discover the sweetness of Thine enthralling utterance, may fix our gaze upon Thy supreme horizon, and may come to know whatever hath been sent down through Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the King of Names! Kindle then the fire of Thy love in Thy lands, that the hearts of Thy creatures may be set ablaze thereby, that they may turn towards Thee, may recognize Thy unity and acknowledge Thy oneness. O Lord of all names! Rend asunder before their faces the veils of glory, and make known unto them the excellence of this Day which hath been adorned with Thy Name and illumined with the light of Thy Countenance. Thou, verily, art He Whom the good works of the people can never exalt nor their evil deeds deter, Whom the ascendancy of the rulers cannot humble nor the power of the mighty vanquish. Thou doest through Thy sovereignty whatsoever Thou willest. No God is there but Thee, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nSend down, then, upon Thy loved ones, O my God, from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will cause them to fix their gaze upon Thee and to act in accordance with Thy will and behest. Ordain for them, then, what will profit them and preserve them, what will draw them nigh and set them free. Verily Thou art their Lord, their Creator, and their Helper.

Whoso cleaveth unto Him hath verily cleaved unto God's mighty cord, and whoso holdeth fast unto His hem hath verily held fast unto the hem of God, the Holy, the Pure, the Mighty, the Luminous.\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Whose voice was raised from the Most Exalted Horizon is indeed the One Who conversed upon Sinai, Who is established upon the Throne of Revelation, through Whom the Trump was blown, through Whom the decree of resurrection was fulfilled, and through Whom those that lay in their graves arose. Whoso heareth His call hath verily heard the Call of God, and whoso turneth unto Him hath verily turned unto God. Blessed is the strong one whom neither the might of the oppressors nor the power of the tyrants could deter. He stood before all faces and proclaimed with loudest voice: \"O concourse of earth and heaven! The Day hath appeared wherein the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Symbol, which had been concealed in the knowledge of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been made manifest.\"\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My handmaiden and My leaf whom the rapture of the Call seized and whom the wine of the utterance of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names intoxicated, to such extent that she sacrificed herself in the path of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and His mighty and glorious Cause. Say: The peace that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the will of the Lord of Batha, and the blessings that descend from the heaven of grandeur and bounty, and the light that dawneth from the horizon of the heaven of the grace of the Lord of all creation, be upon thee, O luminous leaf who hast sprouted forth on the Mount of Sinai through the will of God, Creator of the heavens and Lord of the Kingdom of Names.\n\nI testify that thou didst answer thy Lord when His call was raised, and didst turn unto Him when most of His servants turned away. I bear witness that the Word attracted thee and the proof seized thee in such wise that thou didst detach thyself from the world and its colors, its ornaments, its pleasures, its blessings and its bounties, hoping for God's loving-kindness and mercy, God's grace and bounty, God's glory and splendor.\n\nO My handmaiden! By thy tribulation the Tablet in the hand of Baha did lament, and the tongues of the faithful were stilled from mentioning thy Lord, the Most High. By what befell thee, the hearts of the holy ones in the crimson chambers and in the Most Exalted Paradise did melt. Alas, alas, for what thou didst hear and witness in the days of God from those who broke God's covenant and His testament, cast aside His laws and His verses, and from those women who denied God and His sovereignty and turned away from approaching His court and entering the precincts of His gate.\n\nI testify that thou didst drink from the hands of thy Lord's loving-kindness the Kawthar of divine knowledge and the choice wine of utterance, and didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke from the most exalted station. Thou art she whom the veils of those handmaidens who cast aside the Book of God, the Lord of all mankind, did not hinder. By thy tribulation hearts were consumed and livers melted, and the people of the cities of unity did lament, and the Maid of Heaven cried out in the midmost heart of Paradise.\n\nI testify that the love of thy Lord inflamed thee, His nearness consumed thee, distance from His presence burned thee, and separation in His days destroyed thee. Alas, alas, for how griefs seized thee from every direction and prevented thee from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of lords. Whenever thou didst hasten, turn and approach, yearning to meet thy Beloved and thy Goal, thou didst find the irrevocable decree as a barrier between thee and the Lord of Eternity, the Object of worship of the nations. And whenever thou didst reflect in the night seasons and at dawn that perchance thou mightest find a way to meet thy Lord, lo, the wall of denial from those who disbelieved in God, thy Chosen Lord, prevented thee.\n\nI bear witness that thou didst believe in God and in that which was sent down from the heaven of His utterance and the horizon of His bounty, and in that which appeared from Him and was manifested by His command. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee at all times from the heaven of the loving-kindness of His Name, the Most Merciful, mercy from His presence and blessing from His side. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO My leaf! Rejoice in the Most Exalted Paradise in what hath at this moment been sent down for thee from the Pen of thy Most Glorious Lord. Blessed art thou for having attained unto a mention that shone forth from the mouth of thy Lord's will. The lights have shone forth in the horizons and the light of utterance hath gleamed forth from the word of thy Lord, the King of the Day of Meeting. I bear witness, O My handmaiden, to thy confession and acknowledgment, thy turning and orientation, thy remembrance and praise of thy Lord, thy Creator, thy Quickener, thy Manifester, and the Manifestation of all who are in the heavens and the earth. I bear witness that by My mention the ocean of forgiveness did surge, and the fragrance of the loving-kindness of Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, hath wafted in such wise that We have heard from the right side \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of all worlds,\" and from the left \"Glory be to the Self-Sufficient, the Most High,\" and from before Us \"The Lord of all beings hath come with a sovereignty whereby the back of vain imaginings hath been broken.\" Thus have the verses been sent down from the heaven of Our loving-kindness unto thee, O My handmaiden and My leaf, who art mentioned in My sacred court and upon My intimate carpet. The glory that proceedeth from Us rest upon thee, upon thy beginning and thine end, thy outward and thine inward being, and the mercy of God and His blessings.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Stay, my Desire and my Object of worship! I beseech Thee by them who hastened to the place of sacrifice in their longing to attain Thy presence, and by their blood which was shed in Thy path, and by the heads which were raised upon spears in Thy Name, and by the bodies which were consumed by the fire of hatred in Thy days and in Thy love, and by this handmaiden whose heart was melted in separation from Thee and whose inner being was attracted by the breezes of Thy verses and the fragrances of Thy utterance, and who was seized by Thy sweetest call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen in such wise that she sacrificed her spirit, her soul and all she possessed in Thy path, that Thou ordain for them who have turned unto Thee what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by her and by her love and her turning unto Thee and her orientation towards Thee, and by her grief in her remoteness from the carpet of Thy nearness and the Dayspring of Thy reunion and meeting with Thee, that Thou forgive me and Thy friends and Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Great. O my God, bestow Thy blessings, O my God, upon Thy loved ones and Thy handmaidens who have fulfilled Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and who have acted in accordance with what they were bidden in Thy Perspicuous Book. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Generous.\n\n=== END BH01002 ===\n\n=== START BH01003 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power\n\nThe world is illumined by the light of knowledge, yet darkened by the dust of the hearts of the transgressors. The sign of the Day when the heaven shall bring forth a manifest smoke was made manifest aforetime, and 'the Kingdom on that Day shall be God's' is delayed and postponed. With this great tribulation and mighty darkness that hath encompassed the world, how can the peoples be worthy of the effulgent dawnings of the Sun of divine favor? All have heard of the Cause of the existence of bounty and have witnessed the precedence of mercy and grace, yet have forgotten the cause of their own creation. 'I loved to be known' was the cause, yet they have forgotten the cause and reason of their own existence. They have abandoned mercy and clung to vengeance, such that naught can be heard from all directions save the clash of swords. The Tongue of Power at every moment whispereth in the innermost heart, saying: Fix your gaze upon this verse and hold fast unto it: 'Lo! though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be within a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, God will bring it forth.' Glory be to God! The cry hath ever been raised, yet they hear not, and the Kingdom hath ever been God's, yet they see not. What hath hindered them? Vain imaginings. What hath veiled them? The heedlessness of the peoples.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Creator of the world and Bestower of favors upon the peoples! Withhold not Thy bounties from Thy servants, and disappoint them not from the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy grace. Purify them from whatsoever hath hindered them from drawing nigh unto Thee and from walking in the ways of Thy good-pleasure. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Beloved of my heart! Thy letter arrived - it was an ocean of love. Thy missive reached Me - it was a book comprehensive in the degrees of affection. After it was read and perused, it attained the honor of being heard by the Lord. He said: \"O 'Ali, upon thee be the peace of God and His favors!\" Praise be to God that neither profit nor loss defiled the holy souls nor held them back from turning unto Him. Blessed are ye, and joy be unto you! The cup of love hath strange effects and wondrous properties. I swear by the Luminary of Batha that this world is not worthy of joy or sorrow, nor deserving the attention of the sincere ones and them that are nigh unto God. For were it worthy, it would have been yours and with you. The world and its adornments are, in the estimation of them that are detached, as a piece of leather paste sewn onto the finest garment - nay, even more detestable than that. It befitteth not the free - it is good only for its people. Verily, it is carrion, and they that seek it are known. We beseech God, exalted be He, to exalt you through His Name, to draw you nigh through His grace, and to make you the ensigns of His remembrance amidst His creation and the standards of His justice amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. Convey unto the believing, unified, and assured ones the greetings from the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist them, preserve them, and ordain for them the blessings of the heavens of His grace and the gifts of the clouds of His bounty. Verily, He is the Generous, the Possessor of great favor. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nEnd\n\nPraised be God! Pure intention, clear purpose, and manifest deeds have caused the fragrance of detachment, love, affection, trustworthiness and truthfulness to waft through the cities of justice and equity. Every unbiased one has perceived it and every unprejudiced one has acknowledged it. One word has been recorded in the book of divine favor which is in truth the light of knowledge and the Most Great Luminary of books: \"Whoso is for God, God is for him.\" This blessed word is, in the estimation of the mystics, beyond the stations of effacement and existence. This evanescent servant gazeth upon this word and cleaveth unto it, beseeching and imploring God - exalted be His glory - to make its effects manifest unto all His servants. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAs to your mention of him who is in truth the solace of the eyes, Aqa Mirza Mahdi - upon him be God's peace - the servant beareth witness that he is among the triumphant ones. Convey my greetings unto him. His letter was received and from it wafted the fragrance of love, affection, sincerity and devotion. In truth, his entire letter appeared to this evanescent one as a single word: \"Verily I am for God alone.\" Well is it with him! He hath drunk from the ocean and hath not contented himself with the river. He is among those servants from whom one cannot witness excessive attention from the Source, for the doors of \"Is there more?\" would open. In truth, he is worthy of a hundred thousand mentions and salutations. On this night, mention of him flowed from the blessed tongue in such wise as to attract hearts, cause bodies to soar, let alone spirits.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about the petition of Aqa 'Abbas - may God assist him - some time ago a letter arrived from the beloved of hearts, His Holiness Samandar - upon him be the Glory of God - and they forwarded the petition of the aforementioned one. A Tablet was graciously revealed; after perusing it they should forward it. The mention of this 'Abbas opened a door to the meeting with the spiritual beloved, Haji 'Abbas - upon him be God's peace and favors. We beseech God to assist him, confirm him and draw him nigh unto Him in all conditions.\n\nThe petition of Haji Yusuf - may God, exalted be He, strengthen him - arrived and one blessed Tablet was sent to be delivered to him. Convey my greetings to the friends of that land. I beseech from God whatsoever leadeth to the manifestation of praiseworthy character. In truth, the horizons are illumined and radiant through goodly character. Likewise, I seek divine confirmation that they may hold fast unto wisdom and fix their gaze upon it. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Specifically, they commanded: Write to 'Ali: \"O 'Ali! Thou art remembered in all conditions. We counsel thee to observe wisdom. Take hold of it and leave all else.\" End.\n\nAs to the mention of falling short in services - God is the witness and creation doth testify that that beloved of hearts hath ever been steadfast in service, vocal in remembrance, adorned with truthfulness, illumined with faithfulness, and embellished with trustworthiness. Praise be to God for all of this. Verily, He is the Helper, and He is the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Peace and praise be upon you and upon God's sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH01003 ===\n\n=== START BH01004 ===\n\nO Shaykh Sadiq! In the Name of God, the All-Knowing!\n\nUnto God belongs the knowledge of the heavens and earth. He has manifested Himself through His Name, the All-Knowing, unto all things. Blessed is he who has turned unto Him, for He is the Mirror of His knowledge amongst creation, and He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThe beginning of all knowledge is the recognition of Him. Whoso has attained unto this has attained unto all knowledge, and whoso is deprived of it cannot truly be called learned, even should he possess the knowledge of the first and the last ones. For the knowledge that is intended is the recognition of Him Who has appeared with the truth - the recognition of God amongst all peoples. Blessed is the learned one who has attained unto Him Who is the Known, and has cast aside vain imaginings in these days of his Lord. He is among the most exalted of beings in the sight of God, and his is a station of glorious honor.\n\nHe who has studied all branches of knowledge yet has failed to recognize Him Who is the Known is accounted as the most ignorant among men, and his name is not inscribed in the Preserved Tablet of glory. We have counseled all the manifestations of knowledge, one and all, not to hesitate in this Cause, even should they possess all the gems of wisdom and learning. Thus has the Truth decreed, and thus has the matter been ordained by God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.\n\nWhen the promised time came and the heaven was cleft asunder with clouds and the Promised One appeared with manifest sovereignty, those servants who were created by His Word rose up against Him and denied God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Say: Knowledge is a mirror of divine unity wherein are reflected the lights of His knowledge from the presence of a wise and knowing God. Through it faces are illumined, hearts are assured, the breasts of the sincere are enlightened, and the dwellers of the highest paradise and then God's devoted servants rejoice.\n\nBehold in these days how he who was named Muhammad from the people of Qaf was so deceived by knowledge that he disbelieved in God, turned away from His verses, and became a leader of the polytheists to the depths of hell, together with him who came into the presence of the Countenance in Iraq and upon whom shone the Orb of the horizons with the lights of wisdom and inner meanings, and was among the triumphant. In those days he opposed the All-Merciful, whispered into the breasts of men, and sought to refute the Truth through what he possessed, though he had acquired naught of outward knowledge save a measured portion. Thus was he veiled from Him Who possesseth knowledge of what was and what shall be. This, notwithstanding his certainty that the Bayan was revealed solely for this Cause, and that the Pen of God moved only for this irrevocable Announcement.\n\nLikewise, behold him who was named after Him from among the people of Sad, who emigrated with God yet was unable to speak in the presence of even one of Our servants. When We arrived in the Prison, he committed that which was forbidden. When We banished him with justice, he arose in hypocrisy and did what even Nimrod did not do. He united with one whom We had nurtured for numbered years, then joined with the enemies of God, each day plotting anew to extinguish the fire of God, whose roaring proclaims that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThus have We recounted unto thee what befell this imprisoned Youth, though We called all to naught but God and protected them from the harm of those who turned away on a day when the hearts of men were troubled and minds were bewildered. Blessed art thou, O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance, for having believed in God and His signs, for having heard His call, and for being among those who hasten toward the precincts of grace. The clamor of the polytheists hath not prevented thee from turning to God, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nArise then to the Cause, and convey unto men the mention of thy Lord, that perchance the slumberers may arise. Grieve not over anything, but place thy trust in God, Who created thee, fashioned thee, and aided thee to recognize His Self, when all were turning away save those who quaffed the choice wine of the All-Glorious in the name of their Lord, the Most Exalted, who detached themselves from all that hath been created in earth and heaven, and whom the clamor of the wicked prevented not from turning toward the sacred precincts of God, the Mighty, the All-Loving.\n\nStrive lest thou lose what thou art capable of in the aid of thy Lord. This is the best of all deeds in the sight of God, before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the kingdoms of the unseen and the visible. Glory be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words in remembrance of God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.\n\n=== END BH01004 ===\n\n=== START BH01005 ===\n\nMay my soul be a sacrifice for Thy imprisonment, O Thou Who art wronged in the land of ?a, and may my whole being be a sacrifice for your steadfastness, O ye through whom the pillars of polytheism were shaken, the lands of infidelity were made to tremble, the heaven of vain imaginings was cleft asunder, the sun of idle fancies was darkened, and the moons of idols were eclipsed--they who cast the command of God behind their backs and followed what their own desires bade them. Verily they are the heedless ones, verily they are the ignorant ones, verily they are the deniers, verily they are the bewildered ones. Were We to say they are but breaths, We would find them understanding nothing, nor are they aware. And were We to say they are asleep, We would find them running in the valley of base desires. The hearts of the discerning have been bewildered by their deeds and actions, their deceits and stratagems. At one time thou seest them adorning their temples with the ornament of faith and their heads with the crowns of certitude, and at another thou findest them denying the All-Merciful and following what Satan whispers in their breasts. I know not by what path they walk, to what direction they turn, to what horizon they gaze, in what atmosphere they soar, toward what goal they advance, in what valley they tread, or in what land they graze. Where are they who were not deterred by the tales of the world nor the vain imaginings of the nations, who were not frightened by the might of kings nor the clamor of subjects? And where are they whom the croaking \\[of the ravens\\] did not sadden and who remained faithful to the Covenant? Where are they who appear like firm mountains in the Cause of God, the Revealer of verses?\n\nIndeed, this poem of Rumi is most fitting for these days: \"My heart is wearied by these feeble-natured people.\" Glory be to God! Certain souls are seen to be like chaff blown by the wind, like particles scattered in the air. After all the trials they have endured, and after having, in their own estimation, rent asunder the veils of vain imaginings, they are seen clinging to even greater illusions than before. In their claims they profess all the degrees of faith, certitude, steadfastness, insight, detachment, asceticism and piety, while in reality they are observed to be more unstable than a withered leaf. In truth, such souls were and are worshippers of desire. Consider the state of the one who brought forth \"K\" and \"R\". I swear by the Sun of Truth that he addressed such petitions to the Most Holy Court that this servant is bewildered at their mention. In these petitions he claimed all manner of faith, submissiveness, humility and steadfastness, yet he possessed not the steadfastness of a blade of straw. At sunrise he believed in God, our Lord, the All-Merciful, and by morning he had denied Him.\n\nIn any case, this servant clings to the hem of His generosity and holds fast to the cord of His grace, that He may protect His servants, for most of them have been and are the prey of desire. When the tempestuous winds of passion begin to blow, they sweep all away save whom God willeth. How strange are those souls who have forsaken and continue to forsake the Truth for naught. We beseech God to assist all to be steadfast, for verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nYour numerous letters, each of which was a polish for hearts and spirits, reached this evanescent servant, and all were presented at the Greatest Scene and the Seat of the Throne of the Lord of Power. These brilliant words have risen from the Dawning-Place of verses. The gaze of favor hath ever been directed towards you, and the divine Tablets bear witness to His infinite bounties. However, you must in all conditions keep your gaze fixed upon the divine commandments and call all to follow that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. Until the entire world is illumined by the rays of light of the divine commandments, they have borne hardships and tribulations for the sake of God, and in truth, in this regard they have followed the example of the Truth Himself. However, it would be fitting that a Name of Beauty should act in such wise that none could find cause to speak thereof, for the command of wisdom hath been firmly set down in the Tablets, and God, exalted be His glory, hath made it the very foundation.\n\nThis evanescent servant testifieth and beareth witness that the divine favors bestowed upon you have been and are beyond reckoning. However, God willing, you must in all conditions keep your gaze fixed upon wisdom. God, exalted be His glory, this servant, the holy Branches, the people of the pavilion of sinlessness, and those who circle round the throne of grandeur - all bear witness that whatsoever you have done hath been for the triumph of God's Cause. However, in accordance with the wisdom mentioned in the Tablets of the Supreme Pen, there hath been a pause at this station. I hope that henceforth you will adorn the people with the ornament of wisdom and keep your gaze fixed upon it. Your imprisonment and the tribulations you have suffered have caused grief to all, but be not disheartened. God will soon deliver you in truth and will exalt what you have wrought in His path. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nOne day your mention was made before the Throne, and He commanded: Write to My Name: Verily, We shall fulfill what We have promised thee if thou fulfill what We have commanded thee. He, verily, is the All-Seeing, the All-Observing.\n\nAnother submission of this ephemeral one is that you should treat people with the utmost fellowship and kindness so that the odors of discord may be eliminated, for discord's harm affects the very root of the Cause. This matter has caused sorrow to the Blessed Heart, and the harm of no deed has equalled or will equal the harm of discord. The polytheists are waiting to find a pretext to engage in deriding and mocking the loved ones of God. I beseech the True One, exalted and mighty is He, to assist you in all conditions to teach the Cause and to promulgate what hath been revealed in the Tablets. His Holiness the Most Great Branch and His Holiness the Most Mighty Branch - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - convey their greetings, as do the people of the pavilion of grandeur and the other friends and servants, both resident and visiting. Verily the Most Glorious Glory be upon you and upon those who were imprisoned with you.\n\n=== END BH01005 ===\n\n=== START BH01006 ===\n\nIn the name of the Ever-Enduring Speaker! O My Name Jamal! God willing, mayest thou be illumined by the light of the Cause and enkindled by its fire, in such wise that the coldness of the world and its chilling trials may not withhold thee from the warmth of God's love. We have designated thee for the reformation of the world and the healing of the hearts of the peoples. Thou shouldst close thine eyes to all the world and its peoples, and fix thy gaze upon that which hath been ordained by God, exalted be His glory, acting with consummate wisdom. Reflect upon God and His tribulations, and the acceptance and rejection of the people - what they have said and what they have done. Follow then the example of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. Deal with the friends of God with utmost love and forbearance. This Most Great Revelation is the manifestation of God's all-embracing mercy. By His very Self, the Truth! If all outward power - which in truth hath never had and will never have any station with God - were to be manifested, and an executioner were to stand before Us with evil intent, We would certainly not oppose him but would leave him to himself. Hearken with the ear of thy heart to the call of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest be freed from sorrows and grief, and in all conditions remain oriented toward the Supreme Horizon and engaged in service to the Cause.\n\nSome time ago, the answer to thy letters which thou hadst sent to this servant was revealed from the Most Holy Court and dispatched. All the souls mentioned therein were honored with the Supreme Remembrance. Divine verses were specifically revealed and sent from the heaven of bounty for each one. If God willing, thine eyes shall be solaced by beholding them. From the Land of Kha certain petitions have arrived with complaints about thee. The acceptance and rejection of souls hath been and will ever be with God. Great care must be exercised in this matter. God willing, thou shalt be gladdened by that which hath flowed and continueth to flow from the Most Exalted Pen. From the divine traces a most sweet and beloved fragrance is perceived. By My life! Should any soul attain unto it, he would pass beyond himself and all who dwell in the realm of creation. This perishable earth and all that is therein and thereon is not worthy of attention. Hearken then with the ear of thy heart to the warbling of the Bird of Utterance in this holy and beloved atmosphere. It will give thee to drink that which shall make thee detached from all else besides Me. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.\n\nShould anyone commit an error, he should be reminded with the utmost joy and fragrance, and if he be not receptive to reminders, leave him to himself. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of him and of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Jamal! We have remembered thee with that which nothing on earth can equal. Hast thou forgotten the favors of thy Lord? Be thou grateful to thy Master, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. During the days of movement and travel, act with perfect wisdom. That which thou didst send to the Land of Kha was forwarded to the Most Holy Court, and likewise from the Land of Ta. Several years ago, mention was made of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in the letter of Mirza Asadu'llah which he wrote to this servant, and thou thyself wert also in agreement with him in this matter. The House of Worship was previously built in Mosul, and the Land of Kha also intended \\[to build one\\], and the Sun of Permission hath risen from the Most Holy Court for \\[its construction\\] in certain lands if they proceed with wisdom \\[...\\] is not permitted, and likewise in the Land of Ya and the Land of Shin. The details of these matters were revealed in the Sacred Tablet to Ibn-i-Asdaq, and We commanded that a copy thereof be sent. Thus has the matter been decreed by the All-Knowing Commander. You must in all ordinances fix your gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon and act in accordance with that which God hath ordained. At all times the Most Great Bounty hath flowed from the Pen of the Ancient of Days concerning you. Take what behooveth the days of thy Lord and abandon that which is unworthy of thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Wise Teacher. Fix your gaze solely upon the divine bounty. He verily will aid thee and command for thee that which shall profit thee in this world and the next. He is, in truth, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. If you truly occupy yourself with that which hath been sent down especially for you from the heaven of God's Will, and ponder upon it, the intoxication of the divine Kawthar of utterance will so overtake you that you will regard the conditions of the earth and its events as non-existent and utterly forgotten. Occupy thyself most of the time with the recitation of those blessed verses, whereby thy heart and the heart of the world will be gladdened, and thine eyes and the eyes of the nations will be solaced. Thus hath My tongue spoken in this noble station.\n\nWe make mention in this station of the Afnan who have held fast to the Divine Lote-Tree and have responded to that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered when He was established upon the throne of His Great Name. We extol their countenances and give them glad tidings of My gracious remembrance. The glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, be upon them.\n\nAnd We make mention of Husayn, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, that he may give thanks and be of those who are steadfast. O Husayn! The Wronged One calleth thee and summoneth thee to the Most Great Steadfastness in this wise Remembrance. Should a crier come unto you, leave him behind you and put your trust in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and glorify thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnd We make mention of the loved ones of God in that place who have attained unto the lights of certitude. O My Name! The bounty of the True One hath ever encompassed all and continueth to do so, but it must needs be in measure. You must appear among the servants in such wise that all may inhale from you the sweet fragrance of love. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in His bounty regardeth thee and that which hath flowed from thy pen, and is amazed and saith: \"We are God's, and to Him shall we return.\" Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Great Cause whereby the Balance hath been established and the Bridge laid down, and all on earth were thunderstruck save those whom God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, pleased to spare.\n\n=== END BH01006 ===\n\n=== START BH01007 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nThis is a Tablet wherein all spirits are gathered within temples of hidden glory, wherein are created the hearts of the Concourse on High and of those who circle round the Throne in praise, and wherein are ordained the measures of all things from the hidden and sacred Pen. Say: O people of the earth! Do ye not see how God hath created the spirits of those near unto Him through that which He breathed upon them of the fragrances of the veiled Spirit? All things have stood before God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. The breezes of might have wafted over all created things, yet ye remain far removed therefrom. The rivers of oneness have flowed from every direction, yet within yourselves ye remain athirst. The hearts of those who soar in the atmosphere of nearness have drunk therefrom, yet from all this ye remain deprived. Say: The days shall come when ye will lament within yourselves and your souls will be filled with remorse. By God! Evil regrets have encompassed you because of what your hands have wrought, and ye remained veiled from the meeting with God on His Day, even after the Sun of Spirit dawned from the Dayspring of eternity while ye remained occupied at every moment with the ornaments of the world. Woe unto you for what ye have neglected on the Day when the Dove warbled upon the twigs of the beloved glory, when the Fire of God was kindled and called out at every moment that He is God, the Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Praised, while ye remained heedless of all this and were veiled by God's Messengers after they came to you with clear proofs and scriptures which all in the heavens are powerless to comprehend. Thus have ye been seized for what ye did before and for what your hands have wrought in these days, and this is what hath come upon you from the decrees of justice, could ye but perceive the mysteries of justice with the eye of the spirit.\n\nSay then, O people of the earth: Awaken within yourselves, then return wholly unto God that He might forgive your sins and remit what ye have done in His days while ye turned away from His beauty. And thou, O one denoted by the letters Z and Y, hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from the shore of eternity in a land of hidden ruby. Know thou that We have answered thee and remember thee now at a time when Our hands are occupied with work and Our feet with walking and Our tongue speaking holy words and Our hearts suspended in the pavilions of beloved glory. We have cast upon thee these words and distinguished thee therewith in the pavilion of the Spirit, and the near angels now bear witness to what We have taught thee. Therefore, it behooveth thee to thank God at all times and to be among those who circle round the House by God's leave.\n\nThen We remind thee of what thou mentioned regarding detachment from all that ye possess in the kingdom. Say: Detachment lieth in what your hands earn and all that ye labor for and engage in for your livelihood, for this will detach you from having to beg and preserve you from helplessness and abasement in the presence of those who gather as oppressors. This is of the detachment mentioned in the kingdom and all are commanded thereby, that they might be detached from turning to the fields of the hateful and despised. As for the detachment which the people of Paradise yearn for and about which they ever ask God their Creator, it is detachment from all save God and from all that ye know today. None shall attain to the knowledge thereof except those who soar in the atmosphere of nearness and then take shelter in the shade of Beauty by God's leave. This detachment preventeth no one from bearing what they must for seeking their livelihood. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of wisdom that thine eyes might overflow with tears in love for God, the Mighty, the Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. And the purpose of detachment is none other than to raise you to a station wherein no barrier shall prevent you nor shall any rebuker's censure deter you from the grace for which the denizens of Paradise hasten to His court. Know thou moreover that detachment hath degrees that cannot flow from the pen, and were but a single letter thereof to be disclosed, all who are in the heavens and on earth would swoon away, save only those who stand before the Beauty. Therefore, sanctify the mirror of thy heart that it may reflect this detachment and that thou mayest be of those who with their hearts are turned toward the shore of holiness.\n\nAs for what thou didst mention concerning witnessing, know thou that it hath diverse degrees. We shall impart unto thee that which ye are capable of understanding. Among them is the station of thy witnessing thy Lord, wherein thou beholdest Him standing over all things, and thou art among those who with feet of steel stand firm in the valley of steadfastness. Among them is thy station of witnessing in the manifestations of all things, and this is what hath been recorded in the preserved tablets of glory, and this is what was revealed aforetime unto Muhammad in the words \"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves,\" if ye be of them that know. Among them is your presence before the Beauty and what ye witness in His presence. And among them is the degree of martyrdom when the Herald of the Spirit calleth out from behind the sacred veils: \"Arise for the victory of God, O ye sincere ones!\" that ye may strive in God's path until ye sacrifice yourselves in His love, and in this ye find delight in the innermost chambers of your hearts.\n\nAll this We have cast upon thee in truth, and for every station there is with thy Lord a place on the Day when all who are in the heavens and on earth shall be gathered together, and when all veils shall be consumed, if ye be of them that are certain. In like manner, know thou all that thou hast asked and what thou hast not asked in what We have cast upon thee in truth. Then be content therewith and ponder all that hath been revealed unto thee in truth, that God may teach thee what He hath concealed in the pavilion of power and may sanctify thee from the knowledge to which all cling and whereby they have been veiled from meeting their Creator, though all were promised this meeting in the Tablets.\n\nThus do We teach thee the paths of knowledge and the ways of wisdom, that thou mayest be well-pleased with thyself and be of those who at all times rejoice in God's grace. Then convey Our greetings unto the faces of those who are turned toward the countenance of the Spirit. Then cast upon them what We have cast upon thee, that all may be raised up in their temples with hosts of beloved holiness. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who hearken unto thy word concerning thy Lord's Cause, and upon those women who have believed in God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Luminous, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the Most Exalted, the Best-Beloved.\n\n=== END BH01007 ===\n\n=== START BH01008 ===\n\nAlthough revealed generally, He stated it was specifically meant for those opposers who outwardly claim love now but whose inner secrets will later be exposed. It was read to several of the friends while being concealed from him. All people know that certain claimants to divine love in Iraq and other cities were engaged in unseemly acts, but divine mercy prevented the veil from being rent and their deeds exposed. That oppressive soul, during his stay in Iraq, would secretly drink wine and engage in other improper acts. Toward the end of the Iraq period, he would sometimes transgress from secrecy to openness, yet those circling around would conceal it, even though words of counsel were continuously revealed from the Dawning-place of divine verses, as mentioned in most of the revealed Tablets. The acts and deeds of some followers of the Bayan at the beginning of the Cause were not hidden from anyone, yet they considered such things acceptable and divinely permitted, even though God's commandments are sanctified above evil, unacceptable deeds and His most holy court is pure of all detestable and unworthy matters. By God Himself, during the years in Iraq and the days of exile, night and day clear and explicit verses were sent down from the heaven of will, forbidding the servants from what God had not decreed, and these were dispatched to all regions until, praise be to God, some servants came to know and act upon God's will, and the fragrance of the sanctification and purification of God's Cause wafted among creation. Due to people's lack of awareness of divine commands, these words were heard from the tongue of unity as a favor to them: \"God forgives what is past. We beseech God to assist them in sanctification, purification and acting upon what they have been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nIn any case, that oppressive soul and Rida-Quli were constantly engaged in secret in reprehensible acts, and this servant repeatedly counseled both of them - in Iraq, in the Land of Mystery, and in the Most Great Prison - that perhaps they would take heed and awaken from the sleep of heedlessness. It had no effect whatsoever; the words of counsel and manifest healing utterances did not affect them, until Rida-Quli openly engaged in drinking and reprehensible acts with some Christians. Therefore God expelled him by His sovereignty and he joined with the evil ones, namely Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Jan. Some time passed, then one day he sent a petition to the Most Holy Court expressing repentance for his past sins, and likewise another petition some days later. But since he had repeatedly repented and then violated God's covenant and testament, the petitions were not accepted. Some acts appeared from him that were without precedent and caused the corruption of God's Cause among the servants. This evanescent servant does not wish to mention them, so perhaps the angels who spread news will spread word of that rejected evil one's deeds throughout the earth. Verily, God's curse be upon the oppressive people. And regarding his association \\[...\\]\n\nAnd has caused the dissipation of God's Cause among His servants. This evanescent servant did not wish to make mention of it, lest the angels who spread deeds abroad might spread throughout the earth the deeds of that rejected evil one. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! Through the connection of that evil one and evil ones, the fire of sedition and hatred was kindled to such an extent that neither pen nor utterance can reckon it. However, the All-Merciful extinguished and quenched it. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nEvery person of insight inhales the fragrance of sanctification and holiness from the Ancient Beauty's rejection of those souls, for the deeds of Rida-Quli and Aqa Jan the evil one and his sin are evident and manifest to all. We beseech God to open the eyes of the people and make them recognize from His deeds and ordinances, exalted and mighty be He, that which indicates the sanctification of His Essence, the holiness of His Self, and the purity of His Cause. Although most people are asleep, yet through divine grace there exist certain pure souls and penetrating eyes. They distinguish truth from falsehood and recognize from the fragrance of every matter that which brings tranquility to their hearts and souls. Indeed, they are honored servants.\n\nIn any case, the matter reached such a point that the Ancient Beauty secluded Himself in the house and commanded that the door be closed to all, and in no way was meeting possible for anyone. Outwardly, whatever was heard of the calumnies of the polytheists and the schemes of the hateful ones, absolutely no command issued forth from the Dayspring of divine ordinances until one day in the month of Rajab or Sha'ban, a letter from Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid, before 'Akbar, the nephew of Jinab-i-Aqayi Ismu'llah (upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory), was presented before the Countenance. After its contents were presented before the Presence, in response the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet, which God made a mercy unto the sincere ones and a retribution unto the polytheists, was revealed from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful's utterance. After the revelation of that blessed Tablet, the horizon of this land changed and appeared crimson red, increasing each day, until one day verses of favor were revealed from the Dawning-Place of mercy. After hearing it, this servant became assured that, praise be to God, the divine wrath was specific to the evil souls. Some verses of that blessed Tablet were about the longing and yearning of the lovers, and some about the wrath and overwhelming power against the people of hypocrisy. And the text of that blessed Tablet is this, His words, exalted be His grandeur:\n\n\"O My Name Mahdi! There hath come before the Countenance that which thy nephew composed in praise of his Lord, and We perceived therefrom the longing and yearning, and We have revealed for him that which will generate passion and burning in the love of God, the Lord of the Day of Meeting. Blessed is he who readeth and pondereth that which hath been revealed from God, the Almighty, the Powerful. In the Name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Great! The sincere ones have been consumed by the fire of separation\\[...\\]\"\n\n=== END BH01008 ===\n\n=== START BH01009 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nPraise be to God, the esteemed letter arrived and brought joy. The pen moves with longing at your mention and the world of creation is set ablaze thereby. The servant beseeches his Lord on your behalf for inexhaustible good, an unchanging station, unending sustenance, and unceasing bounty. Indeed, each of the blessed letters was like a cloud bestowing abundant rains of favor, refreshing the precincts of that station. This freshness seems to flow from the blessed verse \"and from water We made all things living.\" Glory be to God! The signs of grace and bounty have encompassed the world of meaning and utterance. Verily, God, exalted be His glory, is the One Who keeps count.\n\nAfter visiting, reading, and experiencing joy and delight, we approached the Sacred Spot and, having received permission, made representation before the face of our Lord, attaining the supreme honor of being heard. He said:\n\n\"The honored Afnan 'Ali, upon him be My peace and My glory, stands before Our face and has attained Our favor. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before his face a door from the doors of His grace, a door from the doors of His bounty, a door from the doors of His mercy, and a door from the doors of His might and riches. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful. We ask of the Truth to assist him and grant him perfect patience in all matters. Verily, the nature of this world is to rise and fall, and We ask Him, blessed and exalted be He, to erase the latter and confirm the former. He is the Possessor of grace, ordaining what He wishes for whom He wishes, and He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Transform hardship into ease, and sorrow into joy. Ordain for this Afnan of Thine that whereby Thy signs may be exalted among Thy servants and Thy Word in Thy lands. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Possessor of great bounty. I beseech Thee by the oceans of Thy protection, the depths of Thy power, and the laws of Thy might and wisdom, to send down upon him from the heaven of Thy generosity a blessing from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nConvey to the loved ones the greetings of the Wronged One and make such mention as will open the ears of the world and enable them to attain true hearing. For if one attains to this station, the world's events of any kind will neither sadden nor change him. The honored Haji, upon him be God's peace and favor, along with the honored Mu??afa, upon him be God's peace, have turned toward that direction. Indeed, great success was ordained for them, and they have attained and been honored by what was revealed in the Book. Blessed is he! He has taken for himself a luminous station near the House. We beseech God to ordain for him what We have ordained for the sincere among His servants and the near ones among His creation. Blessed are the loved ones of God and joy be unto them. We testify that they have attained to that which most of the servants have not attained. They are among those whom God has assisted to turn toward His House and draw near unto Him, and He has ordained for them a blessing from His side and a bounty from His presence. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Generous.\"\n\nVerily the servant confesseth that all His names have preceded existence itself, both seen and unseen, and His grace hath encompassed all things, and His bounty hath taken hold of all who dwell on earth and in the heavens, to such extent that the remembrances of the world are powerless to recount it and the descriptions of nations fail to describe it. I beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make His loved ones the manifestations of His detachment, the dawning-places of His generosity and bounty, and the treasuries of His knowledge, and to ordain for them from the Pen of His command that which will exalt them in all conditions among men. He is the Lord of the beginning and the end. This servant hath ever deemed it necessary to mention the Afnan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful. God is my witness that morning and night my tongue uttereth his praise and my heart is aflame with love for him. I beseech God to increase each day His favors, bounties, grace and gifts unto him, that eyes may be gladdened by the lights of the Luminary of His generosity, He Who made him the cause for the manifestation of existence from nothingness and of bounty amongst the peoples. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the Hearing, the Responsive.\n\nToday is post day and surely glad tidings of your good health and the arrival of travelers will reach us. Indeed, such good tidings in letters are the cause and source of joy and gladness to heart and soul. We hope that God, exalted be His glory, will transform these tidings received in absence into tidings received in presence, that we may attain the complete blessing. At this moment, your mention was made in His presence and confirmation was sought, and likewise the mention of the travelers. The apple of the eye of the heart, Aqa Mirza Mu??afa, upon him be God's peace - God willing the decree of return will not be erased from his sight. I beseech God to bring him back to his true abode, that is, to His presence, in perfect health and with the utmost joy and delight. Praise be to God, at this moment he hath been mentioned before the Intended One. God's special favors be upon him and upon those whom God hath adorned with the light of recognition. Verily He hath power over all things.\n\nThe friends in that land are each remembered and are blessed with special favors. This servant beseecheth for them fellowship and unity, and bounty and blessing, and they are indeed attaining these. Verily God, blessed and exalted be He, hath manifested His favor and fulfilled His promise. He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. The beloved of the heart, Haji, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of creation, hath resolved to journey there, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on his behalf for that which is the cause of everlasting remembrance. And I request that you convey this lowly one's greetings, praise and mention to him, and write the details of the events of his return. We beseech God to assist him and us in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is the Generous in all conditions. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\n=== END BH01009

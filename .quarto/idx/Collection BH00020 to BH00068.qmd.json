{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"=== START BH00019 ===\n\nBeloved of the heart, His Holiness Ali-Qabli-Nabil, son of His Holiness Ismu'llah Al-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, may take note:\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nThe man of insight is ever abashed and humbled, for he describes Him Who all limbs and members acknowledge through the word \"indescribable,\" and makes mention of that Station which is confessed through the word \"unmentionable.\" Every person of experience detects from description the fragrance of limitation, and from mention and praise the scent of comprehension. After hearing and being convinced of and acknowledging that the Lord of \"were it not for Thee\" hath declared \"We have not known Thee,\" in truth the station of mention and description, though boundless in the view of those immersed in the ocean of knowledge, yet in one respect it betokens limitation and comprehension, and from this word the near ones and the sincere detect the odor of pride. Therefore, I seek God's forgiveness again, I seek God's forgiveness once more, I seek God's forgiveness. Alas, alas, for my shame and embarrassment and lack of modesty, for I am certain that my mention of Him indicates my existence before the Ancient One, and reveals my station in the presence of the light-rays of the Lord of nations and the Goal of the world. Again I seek God's forgiveness.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest my weakness before the manifestations of Thy power, and my impotence before the expressions of Thy might, and my poverty before the ocean of Thy riches. By Thy glory! When I make mention of Thee, bewilderment and shame so overwhelm me that I long to hide myself beneath the layers of the earth's dust. Alas, alas, for my ignorance before the manifestations of the Sun of Thy knowledge! I testify that in this station, when I utter Thy remembrance, my limbs and members tremble from fear of Thee. Alas, alas! I see my deeds contrary to that which issues from my mouth before the kingdom of Thy utterance, and yet in one station my outer being and my inner being, my features and my veins and my very hairs cry out to me: \"Grieve not at this, for verily He, exalted be His glory, when the ocean of His grace surged and the fragrance of His bounty wafted, permitted His servants to make mention of Him and to praise Him.\" By Thy might and Thy majesty! In another station verily Thou didst create the tongue for Thy remembrance and the eyes for beholding the lights of Thy manifestation. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy Most Great Name and by the light of Thy Cause whereby the world was illumined, to transform that which befitteth Thee not and befitteth not Thy days into that which is worthy of Thy manifestation and Thy sovereignty. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have acknowledged Thy power and Thy authority, and Thy mercy which hath preceded Thy creatures and Thy servants. O my Lord! Ordain for Thy servant and for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and sanctify them from all that beseemeth not the court of Thy glory and the threshold of Thy nearness. Verily Thou art the One with power over rejection and acceptance, over denial and attainment, and verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be.\n\nAfter repeated communications from that beloved of hearts arrived, they were repeatedly honored before the Throne of the Lord. Wave upon wave of the ocean of grace appeared at its zenith, and from the Tongue of Grandeur flowed that which no pen can enumerate and no ink can fulfill. Yet the delay in response was due to the abundance of correspondence - such was the decree of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. That beloved one himself bears witness to what was mentioned, until the letters culminated in this letter dated the fourth of the revered month of Sha'ban. The realms of eternal knowledge bear true witness that whatever flowed from that beloved's pen was the source of greatest joy and the dawning-place of supreme gladness, for from each letter and word thereof wafted the fragrance of remembrance, praise, acceptance, devotion and steadfastness in the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds. After its reading, approaching the station before the presence of the Lord of all beings, it was presented. Thereupon the Kingdom of Utterance was stirred and there was revealed that which attracted the hearts of the people of the cities of knowledge and wisdom. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks:\n\nHe is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of bounty\n\nO son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Reflect upon the Wronged One's Cause and upon that which befell Him of tribulations and ordeals. In all times there shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace that which illumined the realm of seeking and longing, and there flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which raised the dead and endowed them with a new and wondrous life. O son of Asdagh! If one possessed of true hearing be found, he would hear that which the sincere ones and those near unto God heard on the Mount of Knowledge. The purpose of manifestation, remembrance and utterance is that discord might be removed and replaced by unity, and that all might be adorned with blessed and praiseworthy attributes and character that preserve and elevate. Yet in some the opposite is evident - in the station of unity, discord is witnessed, and in the station of trustworthiness, treachery. Ask God that He may enable His servants to drink from the cup of detachment and be adorned with the ornament of godliness. Some have forgotten the divine counsel and have manifested deeds that have caused God's Cause to be wasted among the heedless and the negligent. The ignorant of the world attribute to the Truth whatever reprehensible act they witness from those who claim to love Him. Therefore has My Most Exalted Pen lamented in the Most Sublime Summit and eyes have wept in the Most Glorious Paradise.\n\nConvey to the loved ones the greetings and peace of the Wronged One - greetings that will set them all ablaze and make them ready to hearken to the call of the Speaker on Sinai. Say: O loved ones of God on earth! Hear the call of the Wronged One, adorn your heads with the crowns of piety and your temples with the raiment of detachment, then help your Lord through deeds. This is what ye have been commanded by God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Today deeds and character are the helpers and supporters of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are those men who, for the sake of God, have clung to these two. Fear of God is a luminous lamp - it is the cause of the enlightenment of the world and the means of guidance for the peoples. Had those who claimed to love God held fast from the beginning to His commandments and laws, the world would now be witnessed illumined with the light of faith. In these days there hath come to pass from those who claim to love Him that which hath not come to pass from His enemies. By God's life! The Wronged One is in evident sorrow.\n\nEver-flowing have been the goodly exhortations and loving counsels which in truth are the cause of nearness and meeting and the source of infinite bounties from the Lord of all beings, streaming forth and descending from the Tongue of Grandeur - and in such measure have they descended that pen and ink are powerless to enumerate them. Nevertheless, there hath appeared from some that which would make the very eye of justice weep and hearts lament. This servant, and that loved one, and the friends must all beseech from the heaven of pardon and bounty of the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may assist the heedless to do that which beseemeth them and grant all the grace to return, that they may arise to make good what hath escaped them and not deprive themselves in this Most Holy and Luminous Day of the outpourings and favors of Him Who is the Goal of all beings. Verily our Lord is the All-Loving, the Forgiving.\n\nMention was made of turning towards different regions for the exaltation of the Word of God, and likewise of entering the place which hath been named by the Tongue of Grandeur as Furugh. After being submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these verses descended from the heaven of grace - blessed and exalted be His Word:\n\nHe is the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing\n\nO My friends in Furugh! Hearken unto the call of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving. He hath remembered you with a mention that hath set aflame the hearts and souls, and whereby all things and those in the kingdom of names have testified that there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have remembered you time and again as a favor from Us, for I am the Bountiful in the kingdoms of the unseen and the seen. And We have sent down for him whom We adorned with the distinction of being specially chosen, and his sons, and those with him, that whereby the realities of all things were attracted and faces were turned towards God, the Lord of the Promised Day. We beseech God to aid them to remember and praise Him, and to teach His Cause, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus hath shone forth the Sun of Utterance from the horizon of the heaven of the providence of God, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. The glory from Us be upon you and upon My handmaidens who have believed in God when He came from the heaven of Command with manifest sovereignty.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for the friends of God in Hisar:\n\nHe is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise\n\nO My friends in Hisar! Rejoice in that the face of your Lord, the Chosen One, hath turned towards you from the direction of the Prison and hath remembered you with that which hath attracted the hearts of the righteous. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of the Prison - verily it draweth you nigh unto God, the Lord of lords. We make mention of him who loved Me, who ascended unto Us with a light that illumined the horizons. At the time of his ascension he was met by a company from the Supreme Concourse and the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise. To this testifieth He Who came from the heaven of grace with the banners of verses. And We have remembered those who are related to him by God, and have ordained for them in the Crimson Book that which hath caused the nightingale to warble and eyes to be solaced. We beseech God to assist them in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to write for them what He hath written for His chosen ones. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nWe have desired to make mention of him who was named Mir before Hasan \\[Haji Mir Hasan Beg\\] that he may rejoice in the providence of his Lord on this Day wherein the Herald hath called out from all directions.\n\nAnd We make mention of him who was named Allahyar Beg that he may hold fast to the cord of the Chosen One and that his outer and inner tongue may testify to that which the Speaker of the Mount testified when He was established upon the throne of manifestation, and that he may circle round the Cause with such steadfastness as will not be prevented by the Pharaohs of the earth nor the tyrants of the lands.\n\nWe wish to make mention of him who was named Mahmud (Karbala'i) in the Book of Names, and verily I am the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. O Mahmud! Take the chalice of utterance in the name of the Lord of Religions, then drink therefrom by Our command, and say: O people! By God, there hath been sent down from the heaven of proof that which hath caused the dwellers of the graves to arise, and the Trump to be sounded, and all things to proclaim: The Kingdom is God's, the Cleaver of the Dawn!\n\nO Jahangir Bey! Hearken unto the call of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, from the Crimson Tree planted in the Most Exalted Paradise by the hand of the will of the Lord of all beings, and say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy path and given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance, and made me to know whilst the people were in wondrous slumber.\n\nO Isma'il! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having enabled thee to hearken unto My most sweet call, which hath been the hope of those near unto God and the sincere ones from time immemorial. I testify to Thy generosity which hath preceded existence and to Thy command whereby Thou hast subdued the factions.\n\nO My loved ones in Namiq! We have made mention of you before, and at this hour, through that which hath caused the Luminary of utterance to shine forth from the horizon of the heaven of the mercy of your Lord, the Creator of existence. We make mention of him who drank the choice wine of martyrdom in the path of his Lord before all eyes and vision, and thereby attained unto that which none hath attained save whom God, the Lord of all men, hath willed.\n\nO son of the martyr! Blessed art thou for having held fast unto My handle and clung to the hem of My mercy whilst the people were in heedlessness and error. We beseech God to draw thee nigh unto Him and to ordain for thee from His Most Exalted Pen that whereby the call hath been raised between earth and heaven. The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of the Daysprings of remembrance.\n\nO Abu'l-Qasim! Thy name hath been presented before the Countenance. The face of God hath turned unto thee from this station, and there hath been sent down for thee that which hath caused the fire to blaze forth in the trees, proclaiming: There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Protector, the Mighty, the Compelling. Remind the people of the verses of thy Lord and give them glad tidings of that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in the most exalted station.\n\nPraise be to God! In these days some have repeatedly attained unto the grace of God, glorified be His Majesty. Letters and petitions have arrived and continue to arrive successively, and in each the places and regions of those parts are mentioned, and each of the loved ones hath attained unto that which beareth witness to the grace, compassion and bounty of God, glorified be His Majesty. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who in these days have attained unto the grace of God, for the Word of God shall not be seized by extinction, nor shall change find any way unto it. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness unto this, even as it hath testified before. Verily He is the One with power to do as He willeth, in the beginning and in the end.\n\nMention was made of Bujistan. After being presented before the Countenance, these verses were sent down from the heaven of bounty. His word, exalted be His glory and mighty be His proof \\[...\\]\n\nO Bijistan, rejoice, then praise, then glorify, then give thanks for being mentioned by Him through Whose Word the heavens and earth were created! How many learned ones were not mentioned before the Wronged One, how many mystics denied the One Known, and how many men were debarred from the Living Waters in the days of their Lord, the All-Merciful! But thou hast attained the grace and mercy of God, and been mentioned by Him Who was remembered in the hearts of those near ones and the sincere ones. We have mentioned Ali in the Book and in the Scriptures and Tablets time and again, and then those who believed in God, Lord of the Mighty Throne. We beseech God to raise up from thee men who will aid their Lord through deeds and counsel people through virtuous conduct, and We enjoin upon them love and fellowship. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have heard the call of those who have turned towards Us and have answered them with a Tablet that shall testify for them in all the worlds of God, the King, the Single, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O son of My Name! Proclaim unto the faces of My servants in My lands, then recite unto them the verses of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. We have sent down for thee in these days that which hath caused the lips of utterance to smile. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for the friends of God in Faran. His word, exalted be His majesty and greatness: Praise be to God! The friends of that land have attained the light of faith. Faran is a good name from which the fragrance of love is inhaled. They may take pride in this name which hath proceeded from the mouth of God's Will, the Lord of the worlds. God willing, the effects of this name shall become manifest and evident in the friends of that land through God's will. We make mention of all at this time - those souls who intended toward the Kaaba of God and drank the choice wine of His presence from the hands of bestowal. All are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God, those souls attained mention, presence and meeting, and likewise the other friends have repeatedly been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen in these days. O son of Asdaq! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Now it is Our wish to make mention of the souls named in the letter, that thou mayest know My friends through My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and earth.\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honor Mir Aqa Husayn Beg, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! O Husayn, upon thee be My Glory! At this moment the Divine Lamp speaketh with these blessed words: O people of God! Take the chalice of success from the hand of the bounty of your Lord, the Subduer of the winds, then drink therefrom in My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Blessed art thou for having held fast to the cord of God and turned toward Him when the oppressors were in manifest darkness and rejection. We beseech God to assist thee in what thou hast purposed in His clear and straight path.\n\nThat which was revealed for his honor Haji Mirza Abdul-Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! O Abdul-Ali, upon thee be the everlasting Glory of God! Give thanks unto God for the Ancient Countenance hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and revealed for thee that which hath attracted the hearts of the nations who have fulfilled God's covenant and testament and taken hold of the Book with strength from Him. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained the choice wine of My utterance, the Kawthar of My knowledge and the Salsabil of My remembrance, the Mighty, the Luminous. The Glory from Us be upon the people of Glory who have turned with their hearts to this Great News.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Ustad Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! \\[...\\]\n\nO Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory! In the Book of old glad tidings were given, saying \"All shall be mentioned by their names.\" Praise be to the Beloved of the world Who hath enabled thee to attain unto that which the Manifestations of Glory and Daysprings of Perfection were deprived. What is meant by this perfection are matters that are acceptable in the sight of the manifestations of vain imaginings. Glory be to God! The heedless party hath made that which is repudiated to be known, and ignorance to be knowledge. We beseech God to make known to them their loss and what hath escaped them in this Day, the mention of which hath caused the leaves upon the trees to speak forth: \"The Chosen One hath come, and with Him are the streams of knowledge and wisdom. Draw nigh and be not of the heedless ones!\"\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honour Karbila'i Hasan - upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! O Hasan! Upon thee be My Glory! Hussein was condemned to martyrdom by the divines of his age, even as in this age they have condemned his Lord. The Books of God lament the oppression of the divines of that age and of this age, but ears are prevented from hearing. Preserve thou the pearl of the love of God in the treasury of thy heart, then conceal it from the eyes of the treacherous ones, and say: \"Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds and Object of worship of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\"\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honour Mir Ahmad Beg - upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! O Ahmad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Single, the One! Say: O people! This is the Day of mention and praise, for the Ancient Beauty and the Beloved of the nations is established upon the throne of bounty. Deprive not yourselves of this most great favor and supreme grace. Strive ye, that perchance ye may attain unto that which may be accepted in glory and endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. The world awaited this Day, yet when it appeared its people turned back. Blessed is he who hath recognized the Purpose and held fast unto that which is known. He is indeed of those who are nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honour Mir Ghulam-Rida Beg - upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God! O Ghulam-i-Rida! The One Purpose hath turned toward thee from the prison of Akka and maketh mention of thee, that His mention may draw thee to a station wherein thou wilt, with the hand of bounty, give the people of Baha to drink of the water of everlasting life. He is verily the Lord of creation. He mentioneth His loved ones in such wise that their names shall endure through the eternity of His names and attributes. He is the Protector of those who turn unto Him and the Purpose of those who have recognized Him. We counsel Our male and female servants to fear God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto My cord and hath spoken My praise amongst My servants. He is indeed of the sincere ones in My perspicuous Book.\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honour Muhammad-Hashim - upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is God, exalted is He! O Muhammad-i-Hashim! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Time and again hath mention of thee been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Verily He is with thee and hath heard thy call in His remembrance and praise. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, thou shalt at all times and under all conditions be enkindled with the fire of His love and illumined by the light of His knowledge. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and cause them to be set ablaze by the light of the divine lamp, that all may, with wisdom and utterance, enable the servants to attain unto the fountain of the Purpose of the worlds. This is the Day of wisdom and service, and service to God, exalted be His glory, hath been and is, in the first degree, the teaching of His Cause. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which is the cause of the exaltation of His Word and the elevation of His station. Upon thee be glory from the presence of One loving and generous.\n\nPraised be God, this is a day for the vision of the sincere ones and the hearing of those drawn nigh, for none but piercing eyes and attentive ears are worthy to behold the waves of the divine ocean of utterance and hearken to the rustling of the celestial Tree. Blessed and happy are they, for they have attained both the hearing and the vision thereof. This is the day of the friends and the time of the pure ones. In truth, the promised hour is bewildered, for this station is one that none but God knows, and none but His Will and Knowledge encompass it. The servant beseeches his Lord to ordain for His loved ones what He ordained for those who attained the Kawthar of detachment in His days. These are servants whose praise and mention adorn the tongues of the Concourse on High. Who can describe them as they deserve or know them as they should be known? These are men who have taken shelter beneath the pavilions of grandeur and majesty by the command of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nMention was made of turning toward the land of Ba and Shin and the village. After being presented before the Most Holy Court, these clear verses were revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur. He speaks, exalted be His glory and abundant be His bounty:\n\nIn My Name, through which the people of the cities of knowledge and wisdom have been attracted!\n\nThe friends in the land of Ba and Shin have been and are remembered before God. In these days their mention has repeatedly descended from the heaven of Will, and each has attained the waves of the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds. Praise be to God, they have drunk from the cup of recognition and certitude, and are recorded and inscribed before God as companions of the Crimson Ark. Verily He loves His friends there and mentioned them before with a mention through which God revived His servants, and He mentions them at this time with that which has caused the fragrances of revelation to waft throughout all possibility. He is the Mighty, the Bestower. Nothing escapes His knowledge. He witnesses and sees, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing.\n\nO My loved ones! Hear My call from the direction of My prison, then remember what has befallen the Wronged One from those who claim knowledge for themselves yet commit that which causes the Concourse on High to lament. He Who came with the truth in the kingdom of verses bears witness to this. We give glad tidings to each one among the steadfast men and women of what God, the Lord of lords, has ordained for them. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who have heard the call and said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in earth and heaven!\"\n\nWe make mention of Our friends in the Best of Villages and remind them of the verses of God, the Lord of all mankind. O Mulla Muhammad-i-Rafi', he who has arisen to serve Me has mentioned thee. We have remembered thee with a Tablet from which the fragrance of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of lords, has been diffused. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who has chosen for himself a station in the days of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Thank God for having mentioned thee through Him at Whose appearance all things spoke forth. The Treasured One has come with a Cause that surpasses all that is treasured in the lands and mountains.\n\nO Mulla Muhammad-i-Taqi! Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having mentioned me time and again and for having aided me to be steadfast in Thy Cause. I testify that Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. I beseech Thee to rain down upon me and upon Thy servants, from the clouds of Thy mercy, the rains of loving-kindness and grace. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nO Ibn-i-Asdaq! We have made mention of him who has ascended unto God, who was named Muhammad-'Ali, and then of those whom God has related to him. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bounteous. We make mention of them at this time and pronounce Our greetings upon their faces, and We ask for them that which will draw them nigh unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nWhen mention was made of each of the loved ones in the presence of the Lord of all beings, they were blessed with the Most Great Favor. The purpose of creation is that souls should be mentioned in His presence and thereby attain to service. The rain of mercy from the clouds of grace and favor descends unceasingly and without delay. No name has been mentioned but that there has been revealed for it that which shall endure through His enduring Name. Blessed are they who exist in these days and are mentioned before His Face.\n\nMention was made of the leaf who is the daughter of the beloved of the heart, H and S, and likewise the leaf who is the daughter of their sister, upon them be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, from years past until now they have been mentioned with God and have been adorned, provided for and distinguished by the mention, favor, bounties and tenderness of the Blessed Tree. In these days a Most Holy, Most Wondrous, Most Luminous and Most Glorious Tablet has been revealed for each one and sent to the beloved of the heart, H and S, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. The servant beseecheth his Lord to make them among those women who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn, and who glorify their Lord morning and evening, and to ordain for them that which shall bring delight to their eyes.\n\nIn truth, the loved ones of B and Sh have been mentioned in His presence every year, nay every month, nay every day. They are blessed with the bounties of mention, utterance, wisdom and knowledge. After mention was made of B and Sh in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, these verses dawned forth from the Dayspring of Will. His word, exalted be His majesty, universal be His bounty, and mighty be His sovereignty:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing\n\nO My handmaiden, O Leaf of Paradise! Thou hast attained unto verses through each letter of which God hath created worlds which none hath understood save Him. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou hast attained in most days unto the call of God, the Goal of them that know. We have mentioned thee and then those women who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. The Kingdom of Utterance hath turned towards thee and revealed for thee and those with thee that which the atoms have testified to through God's grace, favor, mercy and bounty. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nO Ruhani! Upon thee be My Glory and My Favor. Thou didst speak the truth when thou didst turn to God, the Goal of the sincere ones. That which flowed from thy heart and tongue hath attained unto the hearing of thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. My Books, My Scrolls, and that which hath flowed from My wondrous Pen testify to My favor unto thee. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath loved thee and mentioned thee, and blessed is the handmaiden who hath heard thy words concerning this perspicuous News. Thy deed hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. We beseech Him to aid thee in that which shall cause thy mention and His mention to endure through the permanence of My firm and unshakeable Cause.\n\nO youth named Rida! My loved ones there have attained unto My mention time after time, and in these days We have mentioned them again and again with a mention whereby the Concourse on High and the dwellers of this exalted station have been enraptured. Give thanks unto God for His having turned toward thee and adorned thy deed and the deeds of My loved ones with an ornament whereby the cities of deeds have been illumined. Reflect upon that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen that thou mayest find the sweetness of My mention and that which hath been sent down from My Kingdom and the heaven of My favor that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! My heart and My Pen have lamented at what hath come upon Me from the hosts of the heedless who attribute themselves unto My Self and wrongfully consume the substance of men. They are, verily, among the most lost in My mighty Book. They have committed in the Great City that which hath caused the rocks to cry out, the trees to weep, and the tears of them who know to flow. We beseech God to enable all to act with justice and fairness and to aid them to return. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. Praise be to God Who hath aided thee and My loved ones to serve His Cause and to exalt His remembrance. He is, in truth, the Helper, the All-Wise.\n\nO Haji Mirza Husayn! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in such wise as to enrapture the cities of remembrance. Among them are those who have said: \"O loved ones of God! Arise, then draw nigh with pure hearts, sanctified souls, radiant faces, attentive ears, and steadfast feet.\" By God! That which hath caused all things to soar hath been raised up, and that hath appeared at whose manifestation all who are in the heavens and on earth have bowed down in submission. We have sent down for thee that wherefrom the near ones perceive the fragrance of My love. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto the days of God and hath heard that which was raised up from the Most Exalted Paradise. He is among the sincere ones, as every just and informed one doth testify. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy and My grace. Thy Lord, verily, is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory from Us be upon thee, upon thy son, and upon those whom the clamor of the heedless hath not kept back from My straight Path.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Wahhab! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of all men, which hath been raised in the Return, despite every remote learned one. Say: This is the Day whereon the Lord of Eternity hath seated Himself upon the throne of His Most Great Name and hath spoken that which hath guided the peoples to His luminous horizon. Blessed is the eye that hath seen, blessed the ear that hath heard, and blessed the heart that hath turned in recognition to the Dayspring of the signs of its Lord, the Speaking, the All-Seeing.\n\nAt this moment We make mention of My handmaidens who have quaffed the wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty, who have heard the Call from the direction of My prison, who have held fast to My cord and clung to the hem of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise. O My Leaf, O Mother of Muhajir! The Wronged One doth not forget thee. He hath remembered thee and will continue to remember thee throughout the eternity of His glorious and beautiful Kingdom.\n\nWe make mention of another handmaiden. Verily, He loveth His friends and handmaidens who have cast away the world for love of Him and His good-pleasure, and who have taken that which they were bidden in His Book, before which all nations have bowed down when it was sent down. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Informed, the All-Knowing. We counsel all once again regarding the Most Great Trustworthiness. By My life! There hath appeared in the Great City a treachery which hath caused honored servants to lament. We are God's, and unto Him shall we return.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of Thy loved ones in Sarayan and give them the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all lords. O Muhammad-Qabli-?ahir! We have made mention of thee before, and of those who have believed in the cities and regions. By God! The breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted through the lands, yet most of the people are in heedlessness and error. Knowest thou what hath held them back? Say: Their vain desires. And knowest thou by what they are moved? Say: By the doubts of those who have denied the Beginning and the Return. Remind My loved ones on My behalf and illumine them with that which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the Tablet of God, the Lord of all men. The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Promised One hath come with a light that no cloud can obscure. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the world, and glorification be unto Thee, O Revealer of verses! I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested that which hath guided mankind to the straight path.\n\nO Masud! Hearken to the Call of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Thy name was mentioned before in the presence of Him Who is the Lord of Bounty, and He answered thee with mercy from His presence - and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Every secret hath been revealed, every matter hath come forth, and every tongue hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to the Lord of all being. Thy name was mentioned yet again, and We have remembered thee time after time as a command from Us - and We are the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou for having heard and turned towards Him, and woe unto every heedless one who is rejected. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which kindleth hearts and souls, and in trustworthiness, chastity and unity. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted upon that which he was commanded in My irrevocable Tablet. Blessed is he who hath confined his affairs to uniting the hearts of the loved ones, and blessed is he who hath held fast to His Extended Cord. Remember My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from God, the Lord of Hosts. By My life! Whosoever among the servants and handmaidens hath turned towards Me, the Pen hath been moved to mention him and he hath attained the bounty of the Ancient Lord Who hath proclaimed before the faces of all nations: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom and of the Realm.\n\nO friends of God and His loved ones! That which is the cause of the life of the world and its peoples hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance for each one of the friends. The world hath been refreshed by the divine fragrance. By the life of our Lord and your Lord, each day a Book is revealed and each night a proof is made manifest, yet the people are heedless. I beseech God to aid His loved ones to promote His Cause - that is, through wisdom and utterance. The world hath been encompassed by proof and illumined by the light of His manifestation, yet the heedless are unaware. What hath been the cause of their unawareness? The knowledge thereof is with our All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord.\n\nAnd this is what hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the Creator, for His loved ones in Kakhk and Junabad. He saith, blessed and exalted be He:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Hearing, in My Name, the All-Seeing!\n\nO Muhammad! God hath heard thy call and hath sent down for thee that which cannot be equaled by what the people possess. The Book of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, beareth witness to this. Blessed is the ear that hath been honored to hear My call, and the face that hath turned toward My direction, and the eye that hath beheld the traces of My Pen, and the hand that hath taken hold of the Book of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The excellences of the divine days are beyond limitation, and His outpourings are sanctified from end and reckoning. Blessed is the soul that hath not been prevented by clamor, sighing, tumult and croaking from turning toward the Daystar of the horizons, who hath turned with a luminous countenance and, with an eye sanctified from soreness and an ear purified from impediment, hath intended the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit. The Tongue of Grandeur testifieth that such a one is worthy of Glory, established upon the Crimson Ark. Thus hath the Daystar of bounty shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the favor of the Lord of all humanity. Blessed are the people who understand! Blessed art thou for having turned and hearkened when most of the handmaidens and men were prevented from turning. We beseech God to assist thee in serving My Cause and to ordain for thee the good of all His worlds. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nO Ismail! Hear My call from the Kingdom of Mine utterance. Verily it draws thee to the horizon from which the light hath shone forth and illumined the darkness. He who loved Me and arose to serve Me hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with verses beside which the mention of treasures and riches fade into nothingness. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what hath been ordained in His preserved Tablet. We have adorned the heaven of proof with the stars of remembrance and utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained. He is of those whom God hath described in the Furqan with His words: \"They speak not before He hath spoken, and they do according to His bidding.\"\n\nWe make mention of My handmaidens who have turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and acted according to what was commanded in My preserved Book. O My handmaidens and My leaves in the cities and lands! Hear the call of your Lord, the Chosen One. He hath come from the horizon of power with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the seen and the unseen. He hath remembered every servant who turned unto Him and every handmaiden who turned and hearkened and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names, for having guided Thy servants unto Thy horizon and Thy leaves unto the Tree of Thy Cause.\" I beseech Thee by Thy Cause which hath subdued the world and the nations to forgive them and aid them in that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the True One, the Knower of things unseen. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon My servants and My leaves who have believed in Him and His signs on the Day whereon the Balance hath been set up and the Trump hath been sounded.\n\nO Ustad Muhammad-Baqir! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. He calleth thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and casteth upon the world that which will aid them in serving the Lord of ancient days. This is the Most Great Name through which the earth hath told its tales and revealed its treasures and riches. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto the heedless. Preserve what hath been sent down unto thee and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of existence, both seen and unseen.\" Verily the Book speaketh, yet the people hear not; and the light shineth, yet most of the people understand not. The appointed time hath come, and the Sovereign of Signs hath been established upon the throne and hath proclaimed: \"Glory be unto God, the Lord of existence.\"\n\nO My loved ones in Jim and Nun! God hath fulfilled His promise and manifested what He purposed through His word \"Be,\" and it is. Neither the clamor of the servants nor the ranks of those who denied God's proof and evidence and uttered what the ancients never uttered could prevent it. O Muhammad-Baqir! By the life of God! The earth hath been transformed and the people are in grievous doubt. The trees have spoken, yet most of the people remain asleep. They heard the Call yet denied it, and thy Lord's proof encompassed all regions, yet they perceive it not. When it is said unto them, \"By what proof did ye believe in God's Messengers?\" they say \"The Book.\" Yet when its Mother was sent down, they disbelieved and said what caused the near ones to lament. By God's life! They know not what issueth from their mouths. These are but worthless followers who pursue their desires on a Day whereon the Herald hath called out from the Most Exalted Horizon: \"O people of creation! The Throne hath been established in Akka. Hasten! This is better for you than all that hath been created on earth, would that ye knew it.\" When the Kawthar of Mine utterance hath seized thee, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me, and thanks be unto Thee for having mentioned me, and glory be unto Thee for having cast upon me that which hath drawn me nigh unto Thee. I testify that Thou art the Lord of the world. Thou hast appeared and manifested what was hidden in knowledge and treasured with God, the Lord of the Kingdom. Glory from Us be upon the people of Baha who have heard and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and unseen.\"\n\nO My loved ones in Kheirabad! I do not complain of My tribulations and sorrows, but rather mention that which leads to awakening, vigilance and awareness. Every land and city that has today attained the presence of the people of Baha and become conscious of the cause and reason for its own appearance is accounted and reckoned among those who have attained unto God. But the people of Baha are souls who have clung to the Will of God and held fast to the hem of His Purpose. They are the dawning-places of chastity and trustworthiness and the daysprings of covenant and fidelity. I swear by the Lord of the Day that if someone were to call out today \"When were the divine counsels revealed and in which scroll were they inscribed?\", countless tablets from all corners of the world would cry out \"We are the bearers of divine counsels and heavenly exhortations, and We have imparted to every soul that which ensures eternal salvation and everlasting glory.\" Yet some who claim to love Him have seized the temple of trustworthiness and dragged it in chains. That faithless oppressor torments it morn and eve with the lash of tyranny. Such oppression has reached a point where even the pebbles cry out and the date-pit laments \"Woe is me!\" It behooveth every soul to say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and enabled me to recognize the ocean of Thy verses and the heaven of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to assist Thy servants in that which Thou lovest and approvest, and to adorn their temples with the ornament of trustworthiness and fidelity. Transform, O my God, their falsehood into truthfulness, their turning away into drawing near, their denial into acceptance, their oppression into justice, and their tyranny into equity. O my Lord! Help them to turn to Thee and to repent at the door of Thy forgiveness. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Gracious.\"\n\nThrough His boundless grace and infinite mercy, each of the names mentioned in the letter of that beloved of the heart has attained to that which has no equal. Were the door of equity and justice to be opened before the face of the servants, all would testify to that which hath been revealed of the generosity, compassion and bounty of God, exalted be His glory. How many nights have all been resting in their beds while the Tongue of the Desire of the worlds was engaged in mentioning and remembering His loved ones. What praise and gratitude could ever befit these favors? That which proceedeth from creation is not worthy of God - exalted be His generosity, exalted be His bounty, and exalted be His grace that hath encompassed all existence.\n\nMy God, my God! With what tongue and what capacity can we make amends for deeds undone? Our feet are sunk in the mire of heedlessness and our hands are held back from taking hold of the Book by vain imaginings and desires. They have accepted the station of turning away and through hidden grace have concealed it. Whom have we besides Him that we might beseech for that which would make amends for what hath escaped us? Yet, being confined to limitations and bound by restrictions, how can we be worthy to behold or capable of action? And since there is no path save His path and no way save His way, we return unto Him bearing both major and minor sins, for we have none other than Him, nor have we heard of or seen any other. Therefore must we raise our hands in supplication to His most pure hem and cling to the cord of His mercy. He is the One Mighty, the One Bestower, the One All-Knowing, the One All-Bountiful. With a hundred thousand tongues do we beseech that He may assist all to act according to what He hath taught and announced.\n\nO our Lord! We are as children in need of education. We beseech from the ocean of Thy bounty that Thou wouldst educate us through the hands of Thy will and adorn us with, and cause us to attain unto, the station of maturity, which is detachment from all else save Thee and turning toward the court of Thy presence. Ordain for us in all circumstances that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and purify us from all except Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. And protect us from that which beseemeth not Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty, Thy might and Thy power. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nMention was made of Zaveh and the friends of God in that land, especially mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, and mention of his enthusiasm, dedication and arising to serve the Cause. After this matter was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, a Tablet was revealed and sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all beings. The servant beseecheth his Lord to honor him with meeting his Tablet and to grant him what lieth concealed within its binding words. It is hoped that they will kindle those regions with the fire of the Tree and illuminate them with the light of oneness. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. This servant beseecheth confirmation and assistance for them, that they may guide the people of the contingent world with wisdom and utterance and lead them to their goal.\n\nIn the Tablet of Wisdom these exalted words were sent down from the heaven of the Will of Him Who revealeth the verses. His blessed and exalted Word: \"Indeed utterance is a substance that seeketh penetration and moderation. As regards penetration, it dependeth upon pure and unencumbered hearts; as regards moderation, it should be combined with wisdom as prescribed in the Tablets and Scriptures.\"\n\nMost are seen to be immature, therefore the people of those regions must be awakened from the slumber of heedlessness with hands of love, kindliness and consideration, and be guided to the Most Great Ocean. Verily God will aid him and assist him through His grace and mercy from His presence. He is the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the All-Merciful, to His friends there. His Word - mighty be His proof and mighty His utterance:\n\nIn My Name, the Remembering, the All-Knowing\n\nO Shaykh Qasim! Praise be to God, blessed and exalted be He, for having aided thee to turn unto Him and to acknowledge what He hath revealed in His Book on a Day whereon most of His creatures have turned away from Him and denied what hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the heaven of His Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he whom doubts have not weakened and whom the allusions of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment have not hindered. Rejoice that thy mention and thy name have flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur in this remote Prison. He hath revealed for thee what shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly dominion shall endure, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. A single word from His words is not equaled by all that the people possess, as attested by the Preserved Tablet in His presence. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist thee in His remembrance and praise and to aid thee with the hosts of utterance. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. When thou hearest the call from this Most Exalted Horizon, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having adorned my temple with the ornament of turning unto Thee, my head with the crown of Thy love, mine eyes with beholding Thy signs, and my heart with turning toward the court of Thy glory. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty that hath encompassed all existence and by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued all who are in the unseen and the visible, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bestowing.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Shaykh, namesake of the Desired One.\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh the Truth \\[...\\]\n\nO Shaykh, O thou who art called by the name of thy Lord! The face of the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and mentioneth thee with that which hath caused the fragrance of grace to be diffused. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world! I beseech Thee by the hearts which were melted in their separation and remoteness from Thee, and by the light of Thy countenance whereby the cities of Thy knowledge and wisdom were illumined, and by the ocean of Thy grace and the sea of Thy signs, to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. O my Lord! Deprive me not of the outpourings of Thy days, and let me not be debarred from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones through whom Thou hast raised the banner of Thy Revelation on the mount of knowledge and uplifted the standards of Thy guidance amidst all peoples, that Thou mayest make me one of those who have aided Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance, who have circled round Thy Will, detached from their own desires, and who have taken hold of Thy Book with a power from Thee and a sovereignty from Thy presence. O my Lord! Thou art He Who hath awakened me and caused me to hear and guided me unto Thy straight path and Thy firm and mighty Command. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nThat which was revealed for Mulla Rajab-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the One manifest and seated upon the throne of utterance! O Rajab-Qubl-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory! The days have come wherein the seekers have turned toward the Sacred House of God and circled round it by His command and have done that which He hath enjoined them in His Book. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all else save Him and hath attained unto that which the near ones have attained through His grace and bounty. I beseech Him to ordain for them from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall gladden the eyes of all beings. He verily witnesseth and seeth, and He is in the Most Sublime Horizon. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Arise to make mention of thy Lord and give glad tidings unto the servants with wisdom and utterance of that which hath been revealed for them that they may thank their Lord, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. This is the day of witnessing and hearing. Blessed is the ear that hath not been hindered by ancient tales and the eye that hath not been veiled by the veils of the heedless. Proclaim the greatness of the Wronged One before the faces of My loved ones and illumine them with that which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's loving providence. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics, for having illumined my heart in Thy days and guided me unto Thy Most Great and Supreme Path.\n\nThat which was revealed for him who was named Muhammad-Qubl-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing from His Most Sublime Horizon! O Muhammad-Qubl-Husayn! We have made mention of God's friends and loved ones both before and after. He turned unto them before they turned unto Him and remembered them before they remembered Him and directed Himself toward them before they directed themselves toward Him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty. And in another instance He turned unto them after they turned unto Him and remembered them after they remembered Him. Verily, at every moment He is engaged in a fresh manifestation. No occupation diverteth Him from another occupation, nor do the hosts of the oppressors hinder Him. Through Him the decree of affirmation appeared and every wise command was revealed. Aid your Lord through wisdom and utterance lest the clamor of the heedless be raised. He hath appeared through grace and made manifest that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is the seeing one whom nothing hath prevented from beholding My signs and the hearing one who hath heard the call of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged forth as a grace from God that thou mayest give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them who are nigh, for having guided me unto the court of Thy might and given me to drink of the cup of Thy love and illumined me with the light of Thy knowledge and remembered me in Thy prison and revealed for me that whereby the hearts of the sincere ones were attracted.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Mulla Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the All-Seeing in the Most Sublime Horizon \\[...\\]\n\nO Husayn! Reflect upon what befell this Husayn after the Qa'im, this Self-Subsisting One Who hath arisen before all faces with manifest sovereignty. There hath come upon Us from the divines of Iran that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. To this beareth witness whosoever hath judged with fairness in this momentous Announcement. Say: He is the One Whose appearance was promised unto you after the Qa'im. By God's life! Were it not for Him, the Point would not have appeared and the Bayan would not have been revealed. Fear God, O people! Deny not Him through Whom every proof hath been manifested, every evidence established, every horizon illumined, every verse sent down, every ocean surged, and the fragrance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, was wafted.\n\nSay: O concourse of religions! Purify your ears from the tales of the past that ye may hearken to the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen from the most glorious horizon. Thus have ye been commanded aforetime and at this time by the Mighty, the Wise. Beware, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of the choice wine of your Lord's loving-kindness. Turn ye unto His Name and grasp it through love for Him, then drink in remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nSay: By God! That which the people possess will not suffice you today. Cast aside the manifestations of idle fancies and their sources, turning unto God, your Lord and the Lord of your forebears of old. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Most Great Name was in His mighty prison.\n\nSay: O company of divines from among the Persians! Ye have seized the reins of men through My Name and occupy the highest seats through your connection to My Cause. Yet when I manifested Myself, ye turned away and committed that which caused the tears of them that have recognized to flow. Soon shall all that ye possess perish and your glory be turned into the most great abasement, and ye shall behold the recompense of your deeds from God, the Commander, the Wise. Blessed art thou for having cast aside idle fancy and taken the Self-Subsisting One as thy helper. Verily, He is with those who love Him - He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nThis servant also conveyeth greetings to each one and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to increase their enkindlement that through it the hesitant ones may be set ablaze and hasten unto God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nMention was made of the friends in the Land of Kha. Praise be to God, each one hath been and shall be blessed with divine grace, bounty and mercy, both in the past and present. The beloved spiritual friend, his honor Ibn-i-Shahid, upon both of them be the Glory of God and His favors, hath received an abundant portion from the ocean of divine mention, for his name hath been mentioned repeatedly. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. And the beloved of the heart, his honor 'Ayn and Lam, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - his letters have arrived repeatedly, yet due to the volume of correspondence, replies have been delayed. It is hoped that in these days something may be written to him. That beloved one knoweth and hath seen how many responses are written and sent in reply to his letters, while letters continually arrive from all directions requiring answers. In truth, this servant is astounded at the power and might that hath been and is being manifested. In each reply numerous names are mentioned, and for each one there hath been revealed that which hath no peer or likeness. Divine favor hath reached such a degree that no seeker hath been deprived and no petitioner forbidden. All have been blessed with God's favors and tokens. What pen is worthy to describe this station and what tongue capable of portraying this bounty? Nevertheless, the polytheists of the Bayan have denied it all. Never was it imagined that such tyranny would appear from them. The testaments of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, have been cast aside, their entreaties and schemes effaced. The only difference is that the same delusions of the Shi'ih faction have been more firmly established. For twelve hundred years they cried \"O Successor!\" and then martyred the Desired One through Whose word a thousand successors are created. Take ye warning! Take ye warning! Take ye warning! Take ye warning! Take ye warning! O ye who have eyes to see! O ye who have insight! O ye who have understanding! O ye who have knowledge! O ye who are turned unto God! The world is bewildered - they mention a single letter from the pulpit and lament, while cursing the Creator, the Provider, the Quickener, the Slayer, and His Manifestation, then descend from the pulpit. Such is the condition of these heedless, tyrannical people.\n\nAnd the spiritual friend, his honor Haji Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, hath repeatedly been blessed with mention, favor, grace and mercy from the True One, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, Whose favor hath encompassed all, Whose proof hath been perfected, and Whose evidence hath embraced all things. After these passages were presented before the countenance of the Lord of creation, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent specifically for each one. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist them all to recognize what lieth concealed within His words and hidden within His letters.\n\nMy God, my God! Aid them to take hold of Thy Revelation through a power from Thee, grant them to attain its presence through Thy grace and bounty, then cause them to drink of the Kawthar ordained therein through Thy command and power. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nIt is hoped that through His pre-existing mercy, whatsoever hath in these days been manifested from the ocean of bounty of the Lord of existence may awaken the heedless and draw all to the horizon of guidance. There is no name but it hath been blessed with His mention, and no servant but he hath been encompassed by what hath appeared from the kingdom of His utterance. Verily He is the All-Bountiful in grace, the Judge with justice. There is no God but Him, the Counselor, the Merciful, and He is the Speaker, the All-Knowing. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to increase the light of vision and likewise the power of hearing, that they may hear and find that for which they were brought from nothingness into being. Verily our Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful, and He is the Compassionate, the All-Merciful, the Generous.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise of his enthusiasm in the Cause of Truth and his journeys to various regions for the exaltation of the Word of God. After these matters were presented at the Most Exalted Horizon, a Most Holy Tablet was revealed and sent down from the heaven of Divine Will especially for him, that he might drink from the ocean of verses that which would make him the cup-bearer of the Salsabil of utterance among all religions and the leader of the servants to the highest paradise. We beseech for him divine confirmation and assistance in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the Glory of God, who has attained unto the honor of being remembered. Praise be to God, he has repeatedly been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen, and time after time his name has flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur, as have his journeys for the exaltation of the Word of God. In these days too, mention of him has been revealed in various Tablets. As for his request for permission to proceed, which was sought from the heaven of divine favor, after its presentation it was commanded that he should, in those same regions, engage in teaching for the sake of God, detached from all else save Him. In the Most Exalted Threshold, a certain Isfahani, despite being shown the utmost favor, has united with the enemy of God and has incited certain base individuals who revile the believers. They have committed that which no oppressor has ever done. The fire of greed and avarice has seized them; they have misappropriated large sums belonging to the servants of God under the pretense that it was stolen. In short, they have abandoned trustworthiness and clung to treachery, and now they are engaged in corruption. We beseech God to adorn them with fairness and aid them to return. I swear by the Sun of Truth, they have committed that which has no likeness or equal. The decree of God is that none should be molested; however, association, conversation, and meeting with those souls who have turned away and whose opposition has become evident is not permitted. This is a decree that hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of the Ancient Commander. Blessed is he who hath cast aside his own desires and taken hold of that which God, the Lord of all worlds, hath desired.\n\nMention was made of the kindred in the Land of ?a. Some time ago, detailed mention was made from that land of their acceptance, love, and devotion, and this attained unto the honor of being presented before the Most Holy Court. Likewise, that beloved of the heart had previously mentioned that which indicated their love, affection, and steadfastness. Therefore, two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of Will especially for them and were inscribed in the Most Glorious handwriting. They were sent several days ago. God willing, they have attained unto them and have received their full portion from the ocean of divine verses. The kindred of that beloved one have ever been honored with divine mention, and this time too, two Most Holy Tablets were revealed and sent from the horizon of the heaven of grace specifically for the two mentioned leaves, upon them be the Glory of God. The servant beseeches his Lord to send down upon them, their mother, and their grandmother that which befitteth the ocean of His generosity and the heaven of His bounty. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Bestowing, the Effulgent, the All-Knowing, the Most Generous, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nConcerning what was written about the intention of some relatives to travel there - in these days such travel is not permissible, for the thieves have become highway robbers in the great city. Out of love for the honored Afnan, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, assistance was rendered to that person from Isfahan who is now present in the great city. When his business became established and became a point of reference for the friends from all directions, he became inflamed with the fire of greed and avarice. His purpose was to eliminate the honored Nabil Ibn Nabil Haji Shaykh Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. He then united with another person like himself - whose details you have surely heard or will hear - in corruption, and absconded with a large sum of people's money, crying out that thieves had taken it. When this false accusation was not accepted from him, he arose in opposition and proceeded to violate the sanctity of the Cause before all the non-Baha'is of the great city, saying \"The Babis came and stole my money.\" The purpose of mentioning this is so that that beloved one and the friends may be aware that no one should travel to the great city. The wickedness of those two souls has reached the highest degree - they have destroyed the dignity of the Cause of God before the non-Baha'is. This servant begs his Lord to send one who will make known to the people their lies and calumnies. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about Haji S Y, may God assist him in what He loves and is pleased with - he was repeatedly counseled and advised in person, and was explicitly forbidden from that which gives off the odor of corruption. Nevertheless, he clung to his vain imaginings with such tenacity that severing him from them seemed impossible. He then departed from here outwardly content but inwardly complainant. The incident of Rasht and Mazandaran occurred due to his association with certain individuals, for some assumed from his outward association with the companions that the people of God were united with his master. In any case, what occurred, occurred because of this. His outward association is absolutely not permissible, but his distress, given previous acquaintance, is not desirable either. They have not been and are not straightforward. Since they previously showed love, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to sanctify their world of fancy from the dust and darkness of corruption and conflict and all that disturbs souls. Glory be to God! With every soul, righteousness takes precedence over corruption. In any case, regarding them one must pray and seek from God that which will preserve him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about the barking one mentioned in the Tablet of Khadra - the barking ones are souls who divert people from the path and summon them to that which is not truth. Glory be to God! The aforementioned Kazim, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, speaks the truth before all faces and stands firm in service. There has been and is no room for doubt. After the presentation of these exalted words, there was revealed from the heaven of will, these blessed and exalted words: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! Purify the hearts of Thy loved ones from that which beseemeth not Thy days, and unite their hearts and minds and souls that none may utter aught except by Thy good-pleasure. Make known unto them that which was revealed aforetime by honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken and who act according to His bidding. All must fix their gaze upon this word and not precede it in speech. The reins of authority are in His right hand and in His mighty grasp. Well is it with him who is just in all things and holdeth fast to justice. He is indeed among those who have attained in My perspicuous Book.\n\nAs to the Kurdistan matter, some years ago certain souls complained, and they were justified in their complaints, but the Supreme Pen did not rend the veil of concealment and contented itself with allusive references. This year there was a great complaint about another soul, which also remaineth concealed. Verily our Lord is the Concealer, the All-Wise. This matter hath not concerned and doth not concern the few assured souls who are now present in that land. These servants must pray and beseech God that those who attribute themselves to the Truth may move with the lightness of spirit and manifest such spiritual refinement that wherever they enter a house, they may become the cause of sanctification, purification, exaltation, progress and assurance of its inhabitants. Let them not be occupied with themselves but rather turn to the loved ones. In these stations there hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen that which needeth no renewed mention. He is indeed the Expositor, the All-Knowing.\n\nThe page of supplications that was sent by the loved ones to the Most Holy Court was heard. The honored Ibn-i-Shahid, upon both of them be the Glory of God and His favors unto the end of names, and the loved ones and leaves, upon them be 669 \\[the Glory of God\\], each received their portion from the ocean of utterance of the Goal of all the worlds and attained special favors. However, due to lack of time and opportunity, this was mentioned briefly. In truth, whatsoever hath proceeded from the Tongue of Grandeur was and is mighty and all-encompassing. This servant also conveyeth greetings and praise to each one and hath sought and seeketh for each one holy confirmation and assistance beyond the comprehension of minds. Verily our Lord is the Generous, the Munificent. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you and who hear your words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nThe Servant\n\n24 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1306\n\nThe pages will be sent after their arrival.\n\n=== END BH00019 ===\n\n=== START BH00020 ===\n\nThere is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nPraise be to God Who created the letters in the realms of the cloud of unknowing behind the pavilions of holiness in the highest horizon, then gave them to drink from the chalices of eternity according to what was ordained in the Tablets of Destiny, that through them might be quickened the hearts of those near unto God in the heaven of fulfillment. Then He clothed them in garments of black, as was ordained by His eternal decree in the treasury of destiny upon the crimson domes, and as it was foreordained in knowledge that the water of life should be concealed in the darkness of the realms of names at the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End. Then He caused them to descend to the kingdom of creation in the atmosphere of destiny. Thereupon the Voice called out from the Most Exalted Sanctuary, addressing the Primal Pen: \"O Pen! Write upon the luminous white tablet from the mysteries of eternity!\" Then the Pen was struck unconscious from yearning at this call for seventy thousand years by the reckoning of those who count. When it recovered as the decree of destiny returned to it once again, it wept for seventy thousand years with crimson tears. Then it stood before God in a time not preceded by the decree of primordiality in the beginning, nor followed by the decree of finality in the end. When it was consumed by the fire of separation as the sweetest call was cut off from it, there appeared in its tears the color of black in the heaven of faithfulness, and a drop of these black tears fell upon the tablet. Then appeared the Point in the realm of beginning, and this Point was adorned with the ornament of primordiality upon the mirrors of letters in the essences of names. Then the Alif received it before all letters in the atoms of things, and this divine Point was detailed in the form of this eternal Alif as the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted upon it from the source of divine unity. Then the face of divine oneness was unveiled from behind the green veils, and the temple of the Point appeared in the form of the Alif, and it stood upon the tablet, standing by the command of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in the world of attributes and names. This is the station wherein the essence of the divine Will donned the garment of names and was adorned with the robe of attributes in the city of grandeur. When this standing Alif became established upon the luminous tablet, it manifested with another wondrous manifestation. Then appeared the disconnected letters at the beginning of the Manifestations to indicate the worlds of divine unity and command in the cities of creation. Then from these letters which appeared and shone forth from the Alif of primordiality at the beginning of the Manifestations emerged the worlds of limitation and multiplicity. When they were detailed and separated and disconnected, then gathered and combined and mixed and joined, there appeared the comprehensive words and compound letters in the worlds of creation in the temples of names and attributes. Then was completed the creation of the worlds of dominion and the ornament of destiny in the manifestations of beings, that all might testify with the tongue of their essence that He is the Everlasting, the Eternal, the Creator, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Sovereign, and that Ali before Muhammad is the Manifestation of the Divine Essence and the Manifestation of Attributes, from whom began all contingent things and to whom return all created things. He it is who manifested from His bountiful Self the Spirit of the All-Merciful, through which He created the realities of substances and capacities in the world of possibility, and the manifestations of beings in the worlds of existence, and the mirrors reflecting Him, and the letters speaking from Him--the first creation of God and the beginning of manifestations and the return of the servants on the Day of Assembly. This is how God distinguished them above all other creation in the world of pre-existence. Through them shone forth the lights, appeared the moons, blazed the suns, and gleamed the stars, and all of them tell of Him and indicate Him such that there is no difference between Him \\[...\\]\n\nBy them are the ages made to revolve and the cycles to roll, and the trees of unity to be planted, and the fruits of oneness to appear, and the rains of detachment to descend, until the Point returneth to its original station after its revolution around itself and its attainment to its place. Then doth the end return to the beginning, and at that time is heard the call of the First from the Divine Lote-Tree at the renewed rising of the sun. This is what the Dove warbleth in the pole of eternity on this Night of Unity wherein burneth the fire of Oneness from the Sinai Tree in the shadow of the Most Ancient Name and the Eternal Mystery, Who was named the Ever-Living in the Qayyumu'l-Asma, that all manifestations in the innermost heart may testify to that which is hidden, that verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Beneficent.\n\nThis is a Book from the Letter B before H to those who have believed in God and have attained unto the lights of guidance, that it may bring them to the pavilions of holiness and draw them nigh unto the seat which none of those who denied God have reached - to this do testify the Temples of Names in the cities of attributes, and beyond them the holy angels bear witness. Say: Verily in the song of the Dove upon the branches, and the melodies of the leaves of Paradise, and the surging of the sea of Oneness, and the rising of the clouds of wisdom, and the descent of the rains, and the flowing of rivers from rocks, and the establishment of the Temple of Eternity upon the throne of lights, are signs for those who, with the eye of God, observe the realities of things. Therefore ponder, O concourse of loved ones, upon the creation of the heavens and earth, then upon your own selves, if ye be among those who are guided by the lights of guidance in the days of the Face.\n\nVerily there hath appeared before Us a letter from him who is denoted by the letter Qaf, who hath journeyed of his own accord and migrated unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, who hath attained unto the holy precincts and entered the Egypt of certitude, at a station wherein the Fire of God blazeth forth behind the veils of light, and wherein the Lamp of Unity is enkindled within a lantern of concealed glory. Thus have they who have forsaken their homes for the love of God outstripped those who have not drawn nigh unto the sacred shore in that City round which circle they who are near unto God. He hath asked in his letter concerning mysteries which none in all creation hath ever surpassed, whose veil hath been lifted from no face among all beings, and which the mystics have failed to comprehend. Hearken then unto that which the Herald of the Spirit calleth out unto thee from this blessed Spot beyond the crimson sea, in the surging ocean of fire. Know thou that that which thou hast asked concerning the Verse of Light that was revealed aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God - the learned are powerless to fathom it. Were all the pens in God's knowledge and all the oceans in His power to become ink, and were the fingers of might to inscribe that which hath been and shall be, yet would the meanings of but a single letter revealed by the tongue of glory in this blessed and revealed verse remain unexhausted. Nevertheless, I shall cause to trickle down upon thee a drop from the ocean of knowledge and wisdom, that thou mayest be of them that hasten unto the fields of knowledge and drink from the chalices of grace proffered by immortal youths upon eternal thrones. When Moses had fulfilled His term in the Midian of creation, He returned with His family and entered the wilderness of Sinai in the holy valley, on the right side of the spot of Paradise, upon the shore of eternity. Then did He hear the Call from the Supreme Horizon, from the divine sanctuary: \"O Moses! Behold what thou seest. Verily, I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob.\" Thereupon did Moses cover His face in fear of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Again was He called, at the shore of the Sea of Grandeur in the crimson dome: \"O Moses, lift up thy head!\" And when He lifted it, He beheld a Fire burning and shining from the Ultimate Tree in the verdant valley. Thus was He guided by the supreme guidance from the Fire kindled in the Tree of eternity. Then did He cast off the sandals of desire and detach Himself from the kingdom of the first and the last. All this did God ordain for Him, as ye read in the Tablets. Thereby was His Cause exalted and His mention elevated, and He was among those who turned toward the paths of justice by the lights of the Fire. This is what was decreed for Moses, son of 'Imran, in the dome of the pomegranate, did ye but know. Thus did Paran of love witness, at the surging forth of the Fire in the Horeb of holiness and the Sinai of nearness, if ye behold with the eye of God in the scrolls of justice. When the veils of Oneness were rent asunder and the lights of Unity shone forth in the Muhammadan Beauty, the Fire of the divine Essence was kindled within Himself, by Himself, for Himself, and the Fire of the Tree was ignited in His breast. Then did the ardor of love and the raptures of longing seize Him from every direction, and He heard God's call from the Tree of Man in His inmost heart, that \"Verily Thou art God, the Sovereign, the Protector, the Mighty, the Holy.\" This is what was decreed in the wilderness of the Spirit for Muhammad at a station unto which the hearts of those who existed aforetime could not draw nigh. Thus do We recount unto thee from the mysteries of knowledge \\[...\\]\n\nAnd thus do We mention unto thee of the mysteries of knowledge and the gems of wisdom, that perchance the people may kindle and be set ablaze by the fire of God in the Tree of Remembrance. When Muhammad, the Apostle of God, desired to make mention of this most exalted station, that He might acquaint them with the mysteries of Divine Unity in the Tree of His own Self and convey to them His independence from the Fire that appeared unto Moses in the Sinai of Command, God revealed unto Him this luminous verse, that it might serve as a proof unto those who were given the Torah and as guidance unto those who were guided by the lights of guidance in the Muhammadan Tree. And God commanded Moses to give glad tidings unto the people of this Sinai in this Ahmadic Spot, as attesteth that which was sent down in the Book: \"We sent Moses with Our signs, saying: 'Lead thy people from darkness unto light and remind them of the days of God.'\" This is what was inscribed in the Tablets, did ye but know. How then can one who giveth glad tidings of His days attain unto His station, could ye but perceive! Know thou that when Moses beheld the Fire of the Tree on the right side of the Valley, He was guided thereby and became of those who, by God's leave, entered the blessed spot. But Muhammad, ere He had perceived or been touched by any fire, was made by God a light unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, and through this light He guided whomsoever He pleased among His creatures. This is what hath been inscribed in the Book, and ye read it in the Qur'an. Know then that the station of the Niche mentioned in this verse referreth to His Self, the Lamp to His illumined Heart, and the Glass to His holy Temple wherein glowed and shone forth the Lamp of Divine Unity, and through which the Light was kindled, whereby were illumined all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus do We make mention unto you, that ye may be illumined by this Light in the days of the Spirit. After this Light had shone forth in the Lamp of the Muhammadan Reality and was kindled in the Niche of the Ahmadic Being, and the creation of Divine Unity was perfected in His ancient Temple, God commanded Him to remind the people of His meeting in the other Resurrection and to give them glad tidings of a holy and praiseworthy station in the place where the Concourse on High and the souls of them who are nigh unto God shall be gathered together, where the clouds of grace shall be lifted up and the believers shall then rejoice in the gladness of God. This is what was promised in the preserved Tablets of glory in His words, exalted be His sovereignty: \"On the day when thy Lord shall come, or some of the signs of thy Lord.\" This is what was promised unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, that all might testify within themselves that this is indeed the Truth, there is none other God but Him, and that He is in truth the All-Knowing, the Knower of things unseen. Know thou then the station of Him Who came in the shirt of 'Ali upon clouds of light, He of Whose meeting Muhammad, the Apostle of God, gave glad tidings for the day wherein the sincere ones shall rejoice. Then know that after He came unto them with clear signs, what the calumniators said and what they did unto Him, whereat the Pen is ashamed to recount, and God beareth witness unto this, though ye witness it not. They rejected Him and denied Him, and some among them said: \"He hath forged a lie against God,\" or \"He seeketh to bewitch the people.\" Thereby were they veiled from the meeting with God, and they answered Him not in His Cause, nor did they turn unto the Face unto which turn the near ones. O people of the Bayan! Give thanks unto God for what He hath bestowed upon you through His grace, in that He hath made you to know His Self and honored you with His presence.\n\nHe hath honored you with His presence and raised you up with the truth and hath sent down unto you that which maketh you independent of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, after all had awaited His days and all had been promised thereof. Thus know thou what We have imparted unto thee in truth and have honored thee with grace, wherein We have sheltered thee on the shore of knowledge and taught thee the ways of understanding and drawn thee nigh unto the fire whereby were set ablaze the hearts of them that have believed and do at all times put their trust in God their Lord. Then know thou that the purpose of the verse was none other than what We have taught thee in truth, yet none knoweth it save they who have been patient in God, and none comprehendeth it save the sincere ones. This is of the grace that no one of old hath preceded nor shall any of the last ones surpass. But thou, O questioning seeker, in these days wherein the sun of loving-kindness hath dawned from the dayspring of oneness and the lamp of divine identity hath shone forth from the niche of eternity, shalt not witness this verse except in the temple which God hath concealed behind the pavilions of glory in the precincts of the nearness of the Beloved. Dost thou not witness how God hath lit it for Himself with His own fire in the niche of eternity and preserved it with the lamp of power between earth and heaven lest the breezes of polytheism blow upon it? And the light thereof hath appeared from behind seventy thousand veils to the extent of a needle's eye, and the glass vessels of the existence of all created things have been illumined thereby, such that they all speak of God their Creator in that this divine fire hath been manifested unto them. This is what We impart unto thee from the wonders of hidden knowledge that thou mayest give thanks unto God thy Lord at all times, and all the believers likewise, and that thou mayest be well-pleased with thyself in that He hath turned thee toward a shore whereupon no foot of any created thing hath trod save those who are at all times consumed with the fire of love, and none shall draw nigh unto it save they who have detached themselves from all who dwell in the dominions of command and creation and who tread the paths of submission by God's leave. We have thus sufficed with what We have interpreted for thee regarding this holy verse and have been brief in explaining its meanings, for We have interpreted it aforetime in diverse expressions and allusions that would confound the minds of the mystics. Be thou content with what hath been sent down unto thee on this blessed night which God hath made one of those nights wherein every firm decree was ordained by the presence of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. And if thou be not content with what the Pen of Power hath inscribed on these luminous tablets, then return unto what was traced aforetime by the finger of manifest glory, for in the Lote-Tree of utterances hath been kindled the fire of unity and none shall derive light therefrom save the unitarians, and upon its branches are doves all created from the fire of the divine Essence and none shall hear their melodies save them that are detached. By God! If thou wouldst sharpen thy vision, thou wouldst know all sciences from what hath been inscribed in these tablets and become independent of aught else, and this is a known truth.\n\nAs to what you have asked about the disconnected letters in the Sacred Scriptures and Holy Books, know that each of these letters contains signs for those who understand, and within them are symbols, allusions, meanings and indications that none can comprehend except those who walk in the path of God's good-pleasure and who sail upon the ocean of knowledge. Their mysteries have ever remained treasured in the vaults of infallibility, sealed with the seal of power, and veiled by the veil of glory. But now its seal is loosened according to your station and capacity, and according to what people are able to understand, so that those who have been guided by God may testify that all this was created in the Temple of Him Who speaks the truth, around Whom circle all the sublime letters and comprehensive words, could ye but understand.\n\nKnow that these letters, in one station, indicate the eternal essences, the divine realities, and the primal manifestations of the Divine Identity, even as you read in the Qur'an - exalted be His light - at the beginning of the Book: \"Alif. Lam. Mim. This is the Book; there is no doubt in it, a guidance to the God-fearing.\" In this station, God named His Beloved with these extended, disconnected letters, that those who soar in the atmosphere of the spirit on the wings of detachment might attain certitude.\n\nO Muhammad! This is from the Book - the book of thine own self, and this is from the Preserved Tablet which none can comprehend save God alone, and from it all books are differentiated, would ye but be certain. This is from the Book wherein is detailed the knowledge of what was and what will be, by which the guided ones are guided. All that was revealed in the Books and Scriptures of old is but a letter from that Book, and none knows this save those who ascend to the atmosphere of nearness on the Buraq of glory.\n\nAll this is mentioned in the station of description; otherwise this Essential Book hath a station beyond all that can be mentioned or described by any describer. All that was and will be is created by His command \"Be!\" and it is. Therefore, know the Book of Muhammad's Self wherein all mysteries are inscribed by the Pen of God, the Self-Subsisting, that thou mayest testify that there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThus it was revealed aforetime: \"Read the book of thine own self.\" This is the Book which sufficeth those who believe and conveyeth them to the shore of a treasured Name. In another station, it referreth to the Book which was revealed unto him in truth, which God made as a criterion between those who believe and those who disbelieve and deal unjustly with their Lord.\n\nIn yet another station, know that when God named His Beloved with the compound letters and comprehensive words - even as ye speak His names as Muhammad, Ahmad, and Mahmud in the Kingdom of Names - He likewise named him with extended letters and disconnected characters, that all who possess divine understanding might know that all the most glorious letters and most beautiful names were created for him, for naught appeareth from the Beloved except that He intended it for His Beloved - and this is His Beloved, could ye but perceive with the eye of the spirit. This confirmeth the word uttered by the Eternal Dove: \"By whatever name ye call upon Him, His are the most beautiful names\" - this was revealed aforetime, and ye read it in His days, and now most people still read it.\n\nThen know that through these extended and disconnected letters in the name of His Beloved, God created the extended essences \\[...\\]\n\nKnow then that God hath created through these spread and detached letters in the name of His Beloved the spread essences and the exalted, subtle simplicities, even as ye behold in the mirrors reflecting the Muhammadan Sun. Likewise hath He created from the compound words in His name the limited forms composed of unitary elements, each according to their ranks receiving impressions from this Sun. Therefore ponder the creation of the heavens and earth that thou mayest recognize how every name existeth under the shadow of His Name and every attribute under the shadow of His Attribute, and be assured that all things lie within His mighty grasp. He createth from the letters of His Name, that ye may be among those who discern with the eye of God the manifestations of His handiwork. And in another station, the Alif signifieth the Absolute Divinity, and the Lam the Absolute Sovereignty which returneth unto His Own Self, established by His word \"Verily your guardian is God alone\" - this being of God's guardianship, the Mighty, the Praised. And the Mim signifieth the Essence of Muhammad and the Beauty of Ahmad. God addressed Him with these letters that all may be convinced that whatsoever is expressed in words, mentioned by created tongues, or perceived in the contingent realm, all appeareth in the garment of Muhammad. Thus doth the Dove sing unto you from every station the songs of the Spirit, that perchance ye may hearken unto that which is revealed unto you. By God! Were I to expound these three stations contained in these three letters, tablets would not suffice nor ink be adequate, yet We abbreviate each station, if ye be of them that understand. For the reins of the Pen are not in My grasp, out of fear of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and in whose breasts lurketh rancor against this Youth Who dwelleth in Iraq, Who summoneth all unto the Meeting-place, and Who hath dawned from the horizon of unity with a brilliance that hath encompassed all regions. Thus do We mention unto you some of the mysteries of the Cause, that perchance ye may become aware. Otherwise, by Him Who holdeth Husayn's soul in His hand, were it not for the thoughts of the hypocrites, I would mention in this Tablet that which would sever you from all who are in the heavens and earth, and bring you to a station that no ear hath heard nor eye perceived. This outpouring grace shall never cease, even were it to flow from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that none shall see, for the source of this divine spring and this ocean of unity is none other than the reality of the Lord's grace and the essence of eternal knowledge. How then could these sweet flowing waters ever be exhausted? Nay, by my Lord, they shall neither fail nor perish - to this testifieth that which We have demonstrated, and beyond this the dwellers of the Supreme Concourse bear witness. Can God's grace ever end or His outpourings ever cease? Nay, by the Lord of the heavens and earth! Rather His mercy hath preceded all things and His grace encompassed all existence. Say: O people, this is of His grace which descendeth upon you from the clouds of knowledge as rains of wisdom, bestowing upon all contingent things that which shall admit them to the holy paradise and clothe them in the garment of immortality, if ye but reflect upon the mysteries of this grace. Say: O people, how can ye remain sleeping upon your couches, not arising from the seats of heedlessness after the Sun of Love hath risen and all decayed bodies are stirred by its heat, while ye remain like frozen mountains, not melting at the radiance of this Fire, though all who dwell in the precincts of eternity are set ablaze thereby? Say: O people, if ye hear not from this servant who is certain of God, then learn from this Lamp in the stations of love how it is kindled by the fire of love \\[...\\]\n\nSay: O people, ye are like frozen mountains that melt not at the radiance of this Fire, whilst all who dwell within the precincts of eternity are set ablaze thereby. Say: O people, if ye hear not from this servant who is assured of God, then learn from the stages of love how this lamp is enkindled and consumeth itself with the fire of its own being at every moment. Then hearken ye to the wondrous remembrances in its burning, for it calleth upon God in its inmost soul with the tongue deposited therein, saying: \"O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Lamp which Thou hast sanctified above all other lamps, that Thou raise me up in the presence of the lovers, in that station wherein is mentioned the name of God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Promised One Who cometh with the truth upon clouds of fire, circled round by the angels of His Cause. Then shall the clouds of holiness be lifted up and the Dove shall warble in such wise as to draw unto it the hearts of them that are nigh unto God.\"\n\nSay: O people, hear My words, then recognize the worth of these days, hold fast unto the lustrous and hidden Thread, turn not unto the world and its ornaments, neither let adversity grieve you, nor let those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, the Mighty, the Beloved, cause you to waver. Be ye of the choicest of creation who are deterred by no hindrance, veiled by no reproach, prevented by no rejection, even should all who are on earth rise up against them, if ye but know. These are they who turn not unto any face nor care for aught in the kingdom, and should they pass by cities of gold, they pass them by as lightning, paying no heed thereto, swimming in the depths of detachment. These are they who, when the verses of their Lord are recited unto them, feel in their hearts the fire of divine unity and their very frames tremble with longing, then fall prostrate upon their faces before God, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy.\n\nAll this is of the nature of them that are detached. We have cast it unto you in truth that ye might hasten with your own eyes unto the shore of grace. Know thou that in another station God intended by these letters the infinite mysteries, among which is an allusion to the duration of the concealment of the Beauty behind the pavilions of glory, even as ye witness in the traditions of the Imams of the Qur'an. After the passing of 'Alif Lam Mim Sad' and 'Alif Lam Mim Ra', the Mahdi shall arise. Thus should ye recognize these mysteries in all the letters until such time as the lights shall dawn from a holy and beloved dayspring.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! All this pertaineth to the stages of creation and origination, and the manifestations of existence and invention - witness ye this! Otherwise, in that station wherein God hath made them the seat of His holy revelations, they neither point to aught, nor tell of aught, nor indicate aught, and all stand in the holy precincts. Say: O people of the Qur'an! The letters have ascended to their places and the words to their stations, yet until now ye perceive it not. Have ye not heard the day when the Caller shall call out? Have ye not heard the Cry of Truth? How is it that ye remain until now dead within the veils of your own selves? Arise from the couches of heedlessness, then from ignorance and hatred, then hasten unto the remembrance of God - this is better for you if ye desire to return unto the homelands of nearness. Do ye not reflect upon the generations of the past and what befell them when they opposed the Messengers of God and turned away from His signs, though God sent not any Messenger except that He sent down with him a proof that would confound the most eloquent.\n\nAnd with Him was revealed such proof as would confound the most eloquent, and every Messenger gave tidings of the Messenger Who would come after Him, and all were promised His coming. Consider, then, those who were given the Torah: before Moses was raised up among them, they were given glad tidings from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, of the Prophet Who would come thereafter. But when Moses came to them with the rod of command and the Paran of love, they turned away from Him and said: \"This is naught but a crazed sorcerer.\" They denied Him and disputed with Him and contended against Him until, after a number of years had passed, God raised Him up by His command and brought Him to the station ordained for Him, wherein He established His authority and proved His proof and cut off the root of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God and who transgressed without right. Even as ye today invoke blessings upon Moses and those who believed, and curse Pharaoh and his hosts. Thus do We recount unto you true tales, that ye may call to mind in the days of God.\n\nThen Moses gave tidings to the people of Him Who would come after Him. But when Jesus came to them with manifest holy proofs, they waxed proud against Him and said: \"Thou art not He, and art but a man bewitched.\" And likewise did Jesus give them tidings of the Prophet Who would come after Him with glorious intimations. But when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came unto them, they turned aside from Him and denied Him and said: \"This is naught but a man who hath forged a lie against God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\" Then, when He was raised unto God, they gathered round His Cause, as thou seest today, and all weep and lament over what befell Him, and curse those who wronged Him.\n\nAnd at the time of His ascension to the most exalted Companion and His rising unto the supreme horizons, He promised the people of Him Who would come after Him, and the entire Qur'an beareth witness to this. And when the matter was accomplished and the time had elapsed, 'Ali came before Muhammad with clear signs and dazzling proofs and decisive evidences and manifest testimonies. Yet all grew proud against God in His Cause, though they had all been promised His meeting, as attesteth all that hath been inscribed in the Preserved Tablet, even as ye read in the Book that when God sealed Prophethood with His Beloved, He gave glad tidings to His servants of His meeting, and this was decreed with certainty.\n\nBut when God came in the shadows of clouds and the trumpet blast of the Cause was sounded and the heaven was cleft asunder and the mountains were crushed, they all drew back upon their heels. They await His meeting even as the Jews and Christians await what they were promised of old, and from that day until this hour they all wait. How many Messengers did God truthfully send after Moses until this time, yet the Jews perceived it not, saying each year, \"He will come in another year.\" Know thou thereby their measure and the measure of those who dwell in the shadow of their own selves.\n\nBehold, then, these idolaters in what they did of old and what they do today. Thus have We detailed unto you every tiding in detail and cast upon you what befell God's Messengers, that ye might become acquainted with the mysteries of the Cause and be of those who today have entered beneath the shadow of the Divine Countenance. And God hath raised them to a station wherein He made Himself known to them, after they had all turned away from Him. And now We return to Our previous theme and clothe the temple of words in a new raiment of meanings, wondrously woven, that thou mayest be certain that the reins of the Cause are in the grasp of One mighty and awesome.\n\nWe clothe anew the forms of words with the raiment of meaning, woven with fresh and wondrous threads, that thou mayest be assured that the reins of all affairs are held within the grasp of the Mighty, the Dreaded One, Who turneth them as He pleaseth. And when His command cometh to all who are in the kingdom, then are they all among those who are turned about. Know thou that were I to expound the meanings hidden within the Alif which hath been sent down at the beginning of the Book, and the pearls of knowledge concealed therein, verily all who are in the heavens and on earth would swoon away, save them who swim and dive and gather in the presence of the Face in the vast ocean of power. Then would the dogs of the earth assemble against Me, seizing Me with the claws of hatred, denying the grace which hath descended from clouds raised up in the name of God - grace whereby is quenched the thirst of those who, in the Paran of separation, are consumed by fire and some do perish, in such wise that were the spirit of life to be breathed into them, they would not be quickened. And a few among them do drink from these living waters flowing in the darkness of those words, and they praise God their Creator for that which hath shone upon them from the dawning-place of Iraq - the Light of the Horizons - after the spirits had swooned and then recovered. Thus mayest thou understand how the people are divided in their disagreements. For this did God aforetime reveal unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God: \"Few of My servants are grateful.\" Nevertheless, as I do not wish to disappoint him who hath detached himself from all else save God, who hath journeyed unto Him and emigrated for His sake, I shall therefore impart according to the capacity of the servants, what souls can bear and minds can comprehend, that it may be a remembrance and glad-tidings from this servant to those who hasten to the Abode of Peace and enter beneath the shade of the Tree of Union. Hearken then unto that which is revealed unto thee in this blessed spot from this eternal Tree, from which no one hath taken fire, and which none approacheth save those who circle round about it and offer up their souls in His path after His leave, and who do thereby give thanks.\n\nKnow thou that the Alif in one station pointeth to His Most Great Name - He is God; and the Lam to His hidden knowledge; and the Mim to His Name 'the Bestower' - that is, I am God, the All-Knowing, the Bestower. These names God hath specially chosen for Himself at the beginning of His Book, and thereby He hath intended what He hath intended, and none knoweth how He hath intended, for none precedeth Him in His knowledge, and we are all assured of this and do acknowledge it. Then in another station God, glorified be He, intended by the Alif the oneness of His Essence, and by the Lam the Guardianship of His Guardian - for Lam is the letter of Guardianship, would ye but know it - and by the Mim the Prophethood of His Beloved, for it is the letter of Prophethood, as appeareth in the first letter of His Messenger's name, as ye yourselves witness. And He hath placed the letter of Guardianship before the letter of Prophethood, that they who possess understanding might testify that this is a glad-tiding from God unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, that He Who cometh after Muhammad shall have, in His great name, the name of Guardianship preceding the name of Prophethood, even as ye recognize in 'Ali before Muhammad. This is confirmed by the second verse of the Furqan, as revealed in truth: \"This is the Book, there is no doubt in it, a guidance to the God-fearing who believe in the Unseen.\" And the Unseen in the time of Muhammad was none other than 'Ali before Nabil, would ye but believe in this Unseen. And concerning this Unseen did God take a covenant in the atom of the Furqan from all who are in the heavens \\[...\\]\n\nAnd through this Mystery did God take the Covenant in the atom of the Furqan from all who dwell in the heavens and earth, yet most people comprehend it not. Know then how the Bird of the Divine Throne warbles, singing in the lofty pavilions of eternity, teaching you that whereby your minds may find tranquility, your souls find rest, your hearts be gladdened, and the sincere ones rejoice. Then recognize the greatness of this Cause, how God hath made mention of it in the beginning of His Book, His first utterance, and His first address to His Beloved. Yet these transgressors violated God's Covenant, broke His Pledge, denied His proof, and, not content with this, perpetrated against Him that which exhausted the patience of the patient ones. Thus do We impart unto you the mysteries of the Cause, would that ye hear with sanctified ears. By God! Were ye to ponder upon the letter Lam which hath descended between two letters, ye would attain unto all that ye desire. For the Lam in its form is three, even as those versed in calculation reckon in their computations, and by itself becomes three letters: Lam, Alif and Mim. Thus is gathered therein all that We are questioned about. For the Mim hath appeared from itself, and this indicateth its independence, were ye to soar in the atmosphere of detachment and the space of oneness. By this do those who seek proofs deduce that there is no God but He, Who was One in His Essence, One in His Attributes, One in His Name, and One in His Creation. Is there any god besides Him? Say: Glory be to God! There is no God but He, and we are all His servants, and all are bewildered in His handiwork. Thereby are the veils of polytheism burned away, the signs of limitation vanish, and the banners of the unitarians are raised. Then ponder the Alif which God hath made the link between the Lam and the Mim - a mystery that cannot be grasped through perception nor understood through knowledge, even if all who are in the heavens were to contemplate it from all eternity. Thus are the doors of inner meanings sealed in this divine letter, while the doors of utterance are opened to the extent that ye are able to hear. Know then that if this divine Alif were to revolve around itself, two standing Alifs would appear, and when these are raised to the tens, the number twenty appears. Thus is manifested the Kaf of the Command, through which were created the temples of unity, the manifestations of uniqueness, and the dawning-places of detachment - this being before its conjunction with the pillar of Nun, were ye to know. And after its conjunction were created the signs in the worlds of limitation and the royal tokens in the realms of composition. Thus do those endowed with knowledge witness the mysteries of wisdom in that which hath flowed from the Pen of manifest glory. Then know that all letters and words return unto this divine Alif and this lordly figure, would ye but perceive with the eye of the heart. It is the manifestation of letters without any reference to itself, and thus hath knowledge descended from His presence with truth, could ye but understand. Otherwise, ask God, thy Lord, to teach thee through His knowledge and impart to thee that which would make thee independent of those who are not guided by God's signs, who walk in the depths of darkness encompassed by waves of fire from all directions, being drowned therein yet perceiving it not. Then behold the mysteries deposited in this Alif, how in all letters the effulgences of this Alif can be seen. For example, witness in this Alif the letter Ba' in its submission to its Creator, as though it were prostrating itself fully upon the dust in humility before God, as ye can observe in its form. Then it appeared in the form of Dal, bowing before God, the Supreme, the Beloved \\[...\\]\n\nYea, they are immersed therein, yet perceive it not. Then behold the mysteries deposited within this Alif, how in all the letters are manifest the revelations of this Alif, if ye but observe. For example, witness in this Alif the letter Ba, which in its submission to its Creator is as though prostrate upon the dust in complete humility before God, even as ye behold its form. Then it appeared in the form of Dal, bowing before God, the Supreme, the Beloved. And when it prostrated itself before God, it manifested as the letter Sad, from which flowed the waters whereby God quickened all who are in the heavens and earth in the stages of creation, were ye to perceive the traces of creation. Similarly, know all the letters, for they all appeared in different forms through the revelations of this Alif that shone upon them, even as ye observe in the letters of the alphabet. And when God desired to manifest the revelations of this Alif, He caused His likeness to shine upon them, whereupon they all appeared as they were in the garments of these letters. And were they to free themselves from these limited signs, they would all be raised up in the form of this Alif and in its likeness. And if thou desirest to witness the revelation of this upright Alif in the letters in its form and stature, that thou mayest be assured within thyself that it standeth above all things, then observe the numerical figures as ye witness in mathematical calculations. For example, if ye immerse this Alif in the seas of tens, the Alif appears in its form with the addition of a point, manifesting as Ya, for its number is ten, as ye count in arithmetic. Likewise, if ye raise it to the heaven of hundreds, the letter Alif appears exactly the same but with the addition of two points, and ye then behold the letter Qaf. Similarly it ascendeth until it reacheth the end of numbers, whereupon the letter Alif appeareth in the fourth rank with additional points, manifesting the number one thousand, whereby ye witness the letter Ghayn. Therefore witness how the signs of divine unity flow through the dominion of letters, that ye may thereby witness in the horizons of contingent beings and the realm of the intelligible that there is no God but Him, and unto Him do all return. When this Alif witnessed itself in the first and last of the letters, it testified within itself through the tongue of its innermost essence that He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and all thereby unite in their Creator and prostrate themselves before Him. In that station, all letters are true of this Alif, and likewise the revelation of this Alif by itself is true of all letters, were ye to ponder in the paradise of divine unity. And at the moment it is an Alif, the letter Ba is true of it, and likewise ye may witness the reverse. Then know the points that are added to it in all its stations and ranks - this indicates the signs that encompass it in the descent of its revelations, that people might reckon them according to their capacity and ability. Otherwise, were it to remain in its station without donning the garment of limitations, the hearts of those possessed of insight could not comprehend it, nor could the wise understand it. Therefore witness the revelation of this Alif within thyself, for thou art one who heareth and likewise seeth, and when thou hearest and seest, thou speakest what thou willest, such that no matter preventeth thee from another matter, nor deed from another deed, even as ye all witness this within yourselves.\n\nNo thing prevents you from another thing, even as you all witness this within yourselves. Similarly, observe in the names that when the name \"the All-Hearing\" is true of you, likewise the name \"the All-Seeing\" is true of you, and likewise other names, were you to observe with clear sight within yourselves. All these are attributes that all people to this day refer to their Creator unknowingly. Therefore witness within yourself that all this is created in His dominion and He bestows it upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily there is no God but Him. He cannot be comprehended by all that you comprehend, nor known by what you know. Rather, He created these stations in the souls of His servants that all might be guided thereby to the truth that He created the names yet is sanctified above them, and established the attributes yet is exalted beyond them. There is no originator except Him - His is the Command and the Creation, and all create by His command. Say then: Exalted be God, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting! Exalted be God, the Powerful, the Creator, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Beloved!\n\nO people of the Bayan! Strive with your spirits and souls to enter into this station. Be not among those of whom no name among names is true, nor are they characterized by these attributes. Be not among those who have eyes but see not therewith, who have ears but hear not therewith, who have hearts yet understand not. Then witness within yourself that you move and stand and sleep and walk by a single thing, and this is a known truth. Yet from you appear names and attributes, as you all observe and acknowledge within yourselves. These different names and numerous attributes appear through the differences ordained in your souls and created in your bodies, that you might ascend to the heights of knowledge within yourselves.\n\nFor example, that by which you \\[act\\] is one, though you may call it by all names or make mention of it. In its essence it is abstracted from all that you speak of or indicate within yourselves. However, through its orientation to the place of hearing and its means, there appears an effect and attribute and name that appears not from anything else. Likewise through orientation to the place of sight and the means ordained therein, there appears another effect and attribute. This you find within yourselves. Similarly with the tongue - when oriented toward it, speech appears as you speak. This is from its orientation to the outward means in the human temple. Likewise observe the inward with the inner sight. For example, its connection to the heart and liver and spleen and head and other parts - through the differences of these stations appear different names, even as you name them the deed and the soul and the heart. Therefore know the manifestation of this Alif within yourself - how though it is one, God hath made appear from it different names and diverse effects, that you might thereby attain unto the places of knowledge and witness that difference appears through difference of place and means, else the Manifester is one and the manifestation is one. All this is within yourselves - do you not see? That you might be certain that there is no God but Him who hath fashioned creation comprehensive of all His names and attributes, if you squander not the wonders of creation within yourselves.\n\nBehold in yourselves the wondrous tokens of His handiwork, and waste them not. All this was created in His dominion and appears in the realm of creation. O people of the Bayan! Transgress not your bounds. Fear God, and attribute not to yourselves that which hath not been ordained for you, nor exalt yourselves beyond your station. We have explained unto you that whereat the hearts of the mystics, the wise, and the learned were perplexed, through these allusive words, that ye may comprehend what lies therein and that all who dwell in the heavens and on earth may drink from this spring according to their capacity, rank and power. Know then this spiritual Alif, this divine ornament, this straight thread of oneness, how it hath arisen by itself and for itself before all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. At times it raiseth its head toward heaven, whereupon it attracteth the hearts of the Concourse on High; at other times it turneth toward earth, whereupon the bodies of them that are nigh unto God arise from the graves of mortality. Thus do We reveal unto you that which hath been inscribed by the Finger of Power upon the preserved tablets of holiness.\n\nKnow thou that this firm and steadfast Alif hath its likeness in all the worlds, and all draw sustenance from the cord of its grace. All that thou beholdest in all creation - be it steadfastness, uprightness, stability, strength or power - know thou that all this hath appeared through the uprightness of this divine Alif, and all abide beneath its shadow and are made upright through its uprightness. By God! The Word hath reached such a station that the signs of knowledge and the evidences of wisdom are cut off therefrom. Give thanks unto God, your Lord, in your days, and be ye of those who have turned away from all on earth and have turned their faces toward the Beauty of Divine Unity in its luminous vesture behind the veils.\n\nThey drink the wine of inner meanings and the water of life from the hands of the Spirit, and at all times do they render thanks. Should all beauties present themselves before them and reveal themselves in all their ornaments and jewels, they would pay no heed. Even were they to approach them with bracelets of gold and robes of glory made of silk and brocade, seeking to take one of them or enter into the heart of any one of them - by God! they would neither succeed nor would they turn toward them, though they adorn themselves with all possible ornaments and apply all manner of kohl to their eyes. And were anyone to present them with all the gold and silver on earth and all the treasures of the kingdom, they would pay no heed nor turn toward him.\n\nThese are the friends of God, on whom there is no fear, neither shall they grieve. They fear no one, even should all who are in the heavens and on earth rise up against them, nor are they dismayed, for their hearts, souls and minds are filled with the wine of God's mercy and love. There remaineth no space in their hearts for the love of aught else to enter. Thus do We acquaint you with the sincere ones, that perchance ye may recognize them and follow their example, in such wise that neither the tempests of earthly dominion may move you nor the storms of time cause your feet to slip, and that ye may be of those who are firm in their love for God. Know thou then that this Alif possesseth mysteries from all branches of knowledge through what God hath bestowed upon it from the wonders of His grace.\n\nAnd you shall be among those who are firm in their love for God. Then know that this Alif contains mysteries from all branches of knowledge, as God has bestowed upon it from the wonders of His grace, and in it is ordained the knowledge of what was and what will be. For example, if you were to extract the letters contained within the mysteries of this Alif, as We have previously imparted to you, from its four stations, and write their pronunciations, and thereafter divide them into four divisions, and apply to each division what it requires of ascent, descent, elevation and equivalence, there would be revealed to you mysteries at which minds would be bewildered, and you would discover what you have heard of the comprehensive Jafr, and arrive at the source of all knowledge. Would that We could find someone as We desire, that We might impart to him what God has taught Us of His grace, but since We have not found such a one, We have imparted to you according to a determined measure, and We have sufficed with that lest every rejected tyrant should discover it. Then know that these disconnected letters in one station are the symbol between the lover and the beloved, and none comprehends this save those whose hearts God has made treasuries of His knowledge and repositories of His wisdom, and this is what has preceded in God's knowledge, the Supreme, the Beloved. Then know that this Alif in one station points to the white earth and the hidden pearly light, if you wish to perceive the mysteries of natural craft. And this earth's origin and existence is from water, if you would but understand, and it solidifies in water - glorified be God its Creator and exalted be He above what you describe. And when this pearly water solidifies in this fiery water and takes heat from this golden fiery water, there are gathered in it the three: the spirit, the soul and the body - and this is what no one's knowledge has preceded, and all are bewildered therein. When this earth, formed from water, solidifies in this red water, then extract it, and when you extract it you will find on its surface the dust of fire, that is, it blackens, but do not grieve, for if it blackens there is no harm in it, for God will transform this darkness into light such that it will ignite and shine by the leave of God, the Supreme, the Praiseworthy. And this is the holy fruit that has appeared from the tree that grew in the heaven of spheres and the earth of intellects, and this is the philosophers' stone and their silver, and the thirsty earth and their mercury, and all that they name it. And when you extract it from the divine mine, impose upon it from the spirit that was of it and in its kinship, for the body accepts no spirit other than its own, if you would preserve what We impart to you. And days will not pass except that it will whiten by God's leave, so strive in its purification such that no darkness containing corruption remains in it, to the utmost of your ability to strive. Then after that, dry it with a proper fire and impose upon it from this spirit once again, then kindle upon it the reed fire until there rises above this water a hidden red oil. By God, this is from the philosophers' gold about which souls have wandered and the minds of the wise have been bewildered, and until now none has attained it except servants whom the ornaments of the world do not distract from the remembrance of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nKnow thou that up to this time none hath attained thereunto save those servants whom the ornaments of this world have not withheld from the remembrance of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. This is the soul and blood and the red gum, whereby decaying bodies are brought to life when this spirit is breathed into them. Therefore, O ye people of the Art, seek after it! But attend to the fire, and apply it not in such measure as would harm it, for fire both corrupts and perfects, were ye but to perceive it. This is of fire and gold and soul and sulfurous water and divine water and aerial water, and unto it are attributed all names and qualities in its gradations and stations, according to what appeareth therein of colors and effects. Thus do We instruct you that all may be assured that this unlettered Youth of Iraq possesseth sciences that the ancients never attained and that the moderns shall never comprehend, that perchance they may awaken to their condition and cease to imagine what they now imagine.\n\nWhen, O My brother, this luminous child and this spiritual infant appeareth unto thee upon the surface of the water, remove it little by little until thy purpose be accomplished. By God! If the heat of fire should strike it then, it would dazzle the eyes. Exalted be the Maker, the Creator, the Powerful, the Director, the Mighty, the Dreaded! This is of the essence and reality of the spirit, and though it be attributed to aught else, such attribution is but metaphorical. By it are lifeless bodies quickened, rising from their graves, and in the land of divine direction are they gathered. Thus is revealed to thee the resurrection of bodies, that thou mayest be assured of the gathering of spirits into bodies on the day when the trumpet shall be sounded, when the garment of creation shall be renewed, when all shall be brought before the holy presence according to their deeds, when they shall be rewarded for their actions in this vain life, and when all that they were promised shall be fulfilled.\n\nThen shall the melodies of the Divine Dove be renewed, all in the heavens and earth shall be transformed, the earth of knowledge shall be spread out, the cock of oneness shall crow, and the believers shall mount the steed of light. Were We to mention all that shall appear on that Day, the Tablets could not contain it and souls would be sorely troubled. We therefore conceal its mention and return to what We mentioned before, that the grace of God may precede those who enter into the garment of existence.\n\nThen know thou that if thou weddest this oil which We have cast upon thee in truth with this earth, thou shalt attain what thou seekest more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, if ye be of them who succeed in this work. Therefore know gold and silver, then sun and moon, then white and red gum, that ye may understand. Hence they have said that the work consisteth only of the two great luminaries, as ye witness in the books of the people. Likewise know what they mean when they say \"our gold is not the gold of the common people,\" and similarly regarding silver, if ye comprehend. This gold is called two-winged, and it is a bird flying in all bodies, and all names are attributed to it. For example, it is called water due to its flowing and running, fire due to its inherent heat, earth due to its inner dryness, and air due to what is gathered within it. All this is witnessed by those who ponder the mysteries of nature and are of those who, through their detachment from all save God and their turning unto Him, attain to that most exalted station. Then know that this radiant, fiery oil is for the crown of crowns \\[...\\]\n\nKnow then that this radiant, fiery oil is the Crown of Crowns, the Divine Crown, and the Crown of Victory, for by it all bodies are transformed - that is, by it all bodies are cured of corrupting viscous moistures and dark, harmful drynesses. By it all that is created on earth is healed of every disease. Verily it is the Active Essence by which the world subsists, and it is the heat without which there would be no motion - and motion is the action that proceeds from it. Similarly, know with complete certainty that all knowledge comes from heat, if you would but ponder the essences of created knowledge.\n\nVerily it is the Man of Valor, the Young Male, the Eastern Mercury, and the Spirit which, were it to be breathed upon the decayed bones, would by God's leave bring them to life and raise them up - the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nKnow then that the Spirit is naught but the water frozen upon the face of the white earth, and this is from the Command that appears from it suddenly like swift revelation. God has made it victorious over all things, for this is that which, before all things, took shelter in the shadow of God's Name, the Victorious, the Powerful. You shall witness the signs of power from it if you attain unto this station.\n\nThis white earth is the stone from which rivers burst forth. It is unique in its genus, and likewise its operation is singular, if you would but witness in this One the fourfold multiplicities. Its likeness is the Alif which We mentioned - this Alif is one in itself and is not a number, yet numbers are counted from it and multiplicities are derived from it. Yet in the multiplicities of the worlds of numbers, you behold the countenance of the One.\n\nThis stone contains the union of three genera, as you would witness with your own eyes if you would ponder it with divine knowledge. Verily it tells of the Night of Power, for within it is ordained a hidden knowledge which God has concealed from the hearts of His servants, just as He has concealed the Night of Power from those who look not upon the realities of things with divine vision.\n\nWe have likened it to the Night because after the first operation, blackness and darkness appear in it, and these are from the darknesses in which the Water of Life was ordained. This is a truth of which you have not heard before. Therefore, O people of the Bayan, hearken! Then ponder what was revealed aforetime in the Furqan concerning the three darknesses, that your eyes might be consoled thereby and you might attain the ultimate goal for which people have striven.\n\nKnow thou, O servant, that when the Khidr of Glory reached the Dawning-Place of Eternity at the spring of this water, he paid no heed to it and drank not thereof, for the Spirit had transformed him from himself toward the right hand of the Beloved's might. For this Youth desired not to preserve himself in the kingdom, but rather sacrificed his spirit and all he possessed for all who are in the heavens and the earth. This he chose for himself out of love for God, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Praised.\n\nSay: O people, by God, this is a servant who desired naught for himself and sought help from none in the kingdom save God alone. To this the Tongue of Unity bears witness in the pavilion of the unseen mystery. Say: This is a lamp that has sought no niche from anyone \\[...\\]\n\nThis is what the Tongue of Divine Unity beareth witness to from within the pavilion of the hidden unseen: Say: This is a lamp that hath needed no niche from anyone, nor is it affected by fire, nor doth it derive its light from aught except God, the Single, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. Then give thanks unto God, your Creator, for having revealed unto you the mysteries through this luminous and bounded Pen. Though it be bounded by its limitations, yet God hath caused to flow from it that which hath no limit or end. Therefore, behold in this limitation the mysteries of Divine Unity, and be ye witnesses thereof. This is from the knowledge wherewith God hath taught this Pen that all may be assured that the heavens of knowledge are folded up in His right hand and the earth of wisdom is created by His command, and all draw from the wonders of His knowledge.\n\nKnow thou that the first thing that came into being from the Ancient Originator in the worlds of creation was the four elements, which are fire, air, water and earth, as ye have heard before and now hear again. Then appeared the four natures, which are heat, moisture, cold and dryness, as ye reckon and know. When these combined and united, there appeared for each one two qualities: for fire, heat and dryness, and likewise for the remaining three. Know ye these principles, for by them God created all that is in the worlds of creation, both the celestial and terrestrial. Whatsoever hath balanced qualities endureth through time, as ye observe in the sun and moon, and that which hath unbalanced qualities perisheth ere long, as ye behold in the creation of the lower worlds.\n\nStrive therefore to know the balanced things among minerals, for they are easier to work with if ye would succeed, since the process consisteth but of separation, purification and combination - this being the truth of which all the Prophets have spoken. When thou hast known the foundation of nature from the mine of divinity, take thereof according to thy need. Then distill it with the water of life which is of its nature and closest to it in affinity, until this foundation becometh pure white. Then subject it to water and place it in moisture until a prescribed amount of this foundation dissolves. When this earth dissolves with this spirit, thereafter place it in darkness until it mixes and becomes one thing. Then coagulate it over a gentle fire. If thou perform this twice or more - that is, the dissolving and coagulating - that is closer to the truth, if ye would do it.\n\nIf thou art unable, subject this water to this earth, then dissolve it until this water becomes pure white. Then impregnate this earth with this water until ye reach the goal ye desire. Then dissolve it after the impregnation, for the end of impregnation is the beginning of dissolution. Then after dissolution ye shall coagulate. Thus shall the work of the moon be completed for you, and ye shall behold the power of God with your own eyes if ye know what We have set forth in this Tablet. Then after this shall ye work, for knowledge cometh before action. Beware, then beware, O people of the Bayan, that ye undertake nothing before knowing all that We have taught you. This is My counsel unto you - hear it if ye wish to traverse the paths of truth. Know thou that the foundation may also refer to this water, for water is the origin in these works\\[...\\]\n\nThis is My counsel to you - hear it if you desire to tread the paths of truth. Know then that the foundation can be likened to this water, for water is the origin of all works. From it comes the pure oil, and whosoever is anointed therewith shall never be burned. This is of the water whereby God revives the earth after its death and manifests the decree of resurrection. Among the Prophets and Sages, some were content with this water in their work and achieved through it their ultimate purpose. This is of the hidden and concealed knowledge, known only to those whose hearts God has tested with faith and whom He has taught the science of Mercury alone. This is a treasure that was sealed with God's seal.\n\nIf you desire to work with the Sun in gold, return to this substance of pure oil which We taught you before and named it the People's Gold and True Sulfur, though you may be bewildered in working with it. By God, We have mentioned all the works to you and have imparted what none before has succeeded in knowing, as you yourselves can testify if you but recognize it. We have mentioned to you in allusive references the natural measure - whosoever attains it has attained the ultimate purpose in this divine wisdom and heavenly gift, if you would but understand.\n\nWe now impart to you that which will make you independent of those who occupy themselves with this craft on earth. Know that when you have understood that the matter consists only of Mercury and Sulfur, and have recognized them in the Sun and Moon which are gold and silver, know then that salt is excellent in dissolving bodies such that you will find nothing better for gold, were you to examine all things. For in its very nature there is a complete affinity which cannot be fully described were you to write throughout your lives. If you find this salt in its mine and distill it and dissolve with it the calx from which it came and which gave it birth until it becomes one essence and a fixed oil, by God you will reach the pinnacle of knowledge and understanding, for in salts lie hidden the concealed secrets, like the infinite knowledge that resides in pure hearts - do you not see?\n\nThis is of the truth of certainty, without which all people wander in the valley of ignorance. Thus does the dove of knowledge warble upon the branches of wisdom with strains that draw the Beloved near. We content Ourselves with this, though We fear what We have disclosed to you of the matter through holy allusions. But none shall attain to this save through love of God and His chosen ones. This is what the Most Exalted Pen counsels you in these numbered Tablets.\n\nBut if you would hear Me, seek from God that which will make you independent of gold and silver. By God, this is the ultimate purpose, would you but hear it. For from gold and silver none grows rich; rather poverty increases, as you can observe. But through what We have called you to, you will become independent of all who are in the heavens and on earth, if you would but hold fast to the thread of this utterance.\n\nKnow then that this Alif which was revealed at the beginning of the Furqan, and which We have interpreted for you through allusions that confound minds, was created from the Alif that was revealed in the Bayan from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Nay, it becomes as nothing before it, would you but ponder its mysteries.\n\nVerily We have interpreted it for thee through allusions at which minds are bewildered. That which was revealed in the Bayan through the letter Alif hath been created by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. Nay, it is as nothingness before Him, would ye but reflect upon its mysteries. And in one station it was His own Self and Essence, would ye but enter the pavilions of unity. Thus mayest thou know the station of the upright and steadfast Alif on the Day when the essences of knowledge shall be raised up at the promised holy Point, and He Whom God shall make manifest shall come upon the clouds of knowledge and power, with the angels of His Cause at His right hand. Then shall all who dwell on earth be thunderstruck by the thunderbolt of that Day, and the pillars of all creation shall quake, and all shall be disturbed by the might of God's Command. Blessed then are they who attain unto His presence and enter the holy garden before Him. At that time, when they decree a thing, they shall not say why or wherefore, but shall hasten to fulfill what they are bidden. They shall not fear the people of the Bayan, but shall rush like infants to the breast of God's mercy. They shall not turn to anything, nor fear anyone, even if all who are in the Bayan or other religions should prevent them - they shall not be prevented nor turn aside. They shall not open their eyes unto anyone, for they gaze only upon pure Beauty. We therefore beseech God to make us and you among those who circle round Him, who are present upon His carpet, and who bear witness before Him, for verily He is the Powerful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\n=== END BH00020 ===\n\n=== START BH00021 ===\n\nHe is the Almighty!\n\nThis is a Tablet from this Servant, who is called Husayn in the kingdom of names, to the concourse of the kings of the earth. Haply they may approach it in a spirit of open-mindedness, discover from its message the mysteries of divine providence, and be of those that comprehend its meaning, and perchance they may forsake all they possess, turn towards the retreats of holiness, and draw nigh unto God, the All-Glorious, the Incomparable.\n\nO kings of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill, upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: \"There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.\" This is a Spot which hath been sanctified by God for those who approach it, a Spot wherein His Voice may be heard from the celestial Tree of Holiness. Fear God, O concourse of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime grace. Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great. Set your hearts towards the Face of God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow, and be not of those who perish.\n\nRelate unto them, O Servant, the story of 'Ali, when He came unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him. Ye, however, O kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent Heaven. Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained careless until the divines of Persia--those cruel ones--pronounced judgement against Him, and unjustly slew Him. His spirit ascended unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason of this cruelty. Beware that ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto God, your Maker, and be not of the heedless.\n\nSay: The Sun of vicegerency hath dawned, the Point of knowledge and wisdom hath been made plain, and the Testimony of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise, hath been made manifest. Say: The Moon of eternity hath risen in the midmost heaven, and its light hath illumined the dwellers of the realms above. My face hath come forth from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, O concourse of kings! Follow, therefore, that which I speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside. For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather in your nearness unto God and your observance of His command as sent down in His holy and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole earth, and over all that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit him not, could ye but know it.\n\nKnow ye that a servant's glory resideth in his nearness unto God, and that, unless he draweth nigh unto Him, naught else can ever profit him, even should he hold sway over the entire creation. Say: The breeze of God hath wafted over you from the retreats of Paradise, but ye have neglected it and chosen to persist in your waywardness. Guidance hath been given unto you from God, but ye have failed to follow it and preferred to reject its truth. The Lamp of God hath been lit within the niche of His Cause, but ye have neglected to seek the radiance of its glory and to draw nigh unto its light. And still ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness!\n\nArise, then, and make steadfast your feet, and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you, and set then yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty Ocean, so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath stored up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you. Such is the counsel that shall profit you most; make of it your provision, that ye may be of those who are guided aright. Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be quickened. Hearken unto the clear admonitions that We have revealed for you in this Tablet, that God, in turn, may hearken unto you, and may open before your faces the portals of His mercy. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n\nLay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth, and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the Almighty hath fixed. Observe the injunctions laid upon you in His Book, and take good heed not to overstep their limits. Be vigilant, that ye may not do injustice to anyone, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard seed. Tread ye the path of justice, for this, verily, is the straight path.\n\nCompose your differences and reduce your armaments, that the burden of your expenditures may be lightened, and that your minds and hearts may be tranquillized. Heal the dissensions that divide you, and ye will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of your cities and territories demandeth. Fear ye God, and take heed not to outstrip the bounds of moderation and be numbered among the extravagant.\n\nWe have learned that ye are increasing your outlay every year, and are laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This, verily, is more than they can bear, and is a grievous injustice. Decide ye justly between men, O kings, and be ye the emblems of justice amongst them. This, if ye judge fairly, is the thing that behoveth you, and beseemeth your station.\n\nBeware not to deal unjustly with anyone that appealeth to you and entereth beneath your shadow. Walk ye in the fear of God, and be ye of them that lead a godly life. Rest not on your power, your armies, and treasures. Put your whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created you, and seek ye His help in all your affairs. Succour cometh from Him alone. He succoureth whom He willeth with the hosts of the heavens and of the earth.\n\nKnow ye that the poor are the trust of God in your midst. Watch that ye betray not His trust, that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk not in the ways of the treacherous. Ye will most certainly be called upon to answer for His trust on the day when the Balance of Justice shall be set, the day when unto everyone shall be rendered his due, when the doings of all men, be they rich or poor, shall be weighed.\n\nIf ye pay no heed unto the counsels which, in peerless and unequivocal language, We have revealed in this Tablet, Divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction, and the sentence of His justice shall be pronounced against you. On that day ye shall have no power to resist Him, and shall recognize your own impotence. Have mercy on yourselves and on those beneath you, and judge ye between them according to the precepts prescribed by God in His most holy and exalted Tablet, a Tablet wherein He hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure, in which He hath given, with distinctness, an explanation of all things, and which is in itself a monition unto them that believe in Him.\n\nExamine Our Cause, inquire into the things that have befallen Us, and decide justly between Us and Our enemies, and be ye of them that act equitably towards their neighbour. If ye stay not the hand of the oppressor, if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, what right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men? What is it of which ye can rightly boast? Is it on your food and your drink that ye pride yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on the diversity and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves? If true glory were to consist in the possession of such perishable things, then the earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you, because it supplieth you, and bestoweth upon you, these very things, by the decree of the Almighty. In its bowels are contained, according to what God hath ordained, all that ye possess. From it, as a sign of His mercy, ye derive your riches. Behold then your state, the thing in which ye glory! Would that ye could perceive it!\n\nNay, by Him Who holdeth in His grasp the kingdom of the entire creation! Nowhere doth your true and abiding glory reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of God, your wholehearted observance of His laws, your resolution to see that they do not remain unenforced, and to pursue steadfastly the right course.\n\nO kings of Christendom! Heard ye not the saying of Jesus, the Spirit of God, \"I go away, and come again unto you\"? Wherefore, then, did ye fail, when He did come again unto you in the clouds of heaven, to draw nigh unto Him, that ye might behold His face, and be of them that attained His Presence? In another passage He saith: \"When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.\" And yet behold how, when He did bring the truth, ye refused to turn your faces towards Him, and persisted in disporting yourselves with your pastimes and fancies. Ye welcomed Him not, neither did ye seek His Presence, that ye might hear the verses of God from His own mouth, and partake of the manifold wisdom of the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. Ye have, by reason of your failure, hindered the breath of God from being wafted over you, and have withheld from your souls the sweetness of its fragrance. Ye continue roving with delight in the valley of your corrupt desires. By God! Ye, and all ye possess, shall pass away. Ye shall, most certainly, return to God, and shall be called to account for your doings in the presence of Him Who shall gather together the entire creation.\n\nAgain, heard ye not that which hath been recorded in the Gospel concerning those \"which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God\" --that is, those who have been made manifest through the power of God? Wherefore it becometh evident that one may well be manifested in the world of creation who is truly of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How is it then that when word reached you of Our Cause, ye failed to inquire from Our own lips, that ye might distinguish truth from falsehood, discover Our aim and purpose, and learn of the afflictions which We have suffered at the hands of an evil and wayward generation?\n\nO Minister of the King of Paris! Hast thou forgotten the pronouncement recorded in the Gospel according to John concerning the Word and those who are its Manifestations? And hast thou ignored the counsels of the Spirit concerning the Manifestations of the Word, and been numbered with the heedless? If not, wherefore then didst thou conspire with the Minister of Persia to inflict upon Us that which hath caused the hearts of men of insight and understanding to melt, the tears of the denizens of the Realm of eternity to flow, and the souls of them who are nigh unto God to mourn? And all this thou didst commit without seeking to examine Our Cause or to discern its truth. For is it not thy clear duty to investigate this Cause, to inform thyself of the things that have befallen Us, to judge with equity, and to cleave unto justice?\n\nThy days shall pass away, thy ministry shall come to an end, and thy possessions shall vanish and be no more. Then, in the presence of the almighty King, thou shalt be called to answer for that which thy hands have wrought. How many the ministers who came before thee into this world, men who exceeded thee in power, excelled thee in station, and surpassed thee in wealth, and yet returned to dust, leaving upon the face of the earth neither name nor trace, and are now plunged in grievous remorse. Amongst them were those who failed in their duty towards God, followed their own desires, and trod the path of lust and wickedness. And amongst them were those who observed that which hath been prescribed in the verses of God, judged with fairness by the divine guidance that overshadowed them, and entered beneath the shelter of the mercy of their Lord.\n\nI admonish thee, and those who are like thee, to deal not with anyone as ye have dealt with Us. Beware lest ye follow in the footsteps of the Evil One and walk in the ways of the unjust. Take from this world only to the measure of your needs, and forgo that which exceedeth them. Observe equity in all your judgements, and transgress not the bounds of justice, nor be of them that stray from its path.\n\nTwenty years have passed, O kings, during which We have, each day, tasted the agony of a fresh tribulation. No one of them that were before Us hath endured the things We have endured. Would that ye could perceive it! They that rose up against Us have put us to death, have shed our blood, have plundered our property, and violated our honour. Though aware of most of our afflictions, ye, nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor. For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind?\n\nGod hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, and punish the wrongdoers. If ye neglect the duty prescribed unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered with those of the unjust in His sight. Grievous, indeed, will be your error. Cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised, and cast behind your backs the commandments of God, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, the All-Compelling, the Almighty? Cast away the things ye possess, and cling to that which God hath bidden you observe. Seek ye His grace, for he that seeketh it treadeth His straight Path.\n\nConsider the state in which We are, and behold ye the ills and troubles that have tried Us. Neglect Us not, though it be for a moment, and judge ye between Us and Our enemies with equity. This will, surely, be a manifest advantage unto you. Thus do We relate to you Our tale, and recount the things that have befallen Us, that ye might take off Our ills and ease Our burden. Let him who will, relieve Us from Our trouble; and as to him that willeth not, My Lord is assuredly the best of helpers.\n\nWarn and acquaint the people, O Servant, with the things We have sent down unto Thee, and let the fear of no one dismay Thee, and be Thou not of them that waver. The day is approaching when God will have exalted His Cause and magnified His testimony in the eyes of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. Place, in all circumstances, Thy whole trust in Thy Lord, and fix Thy gaze upon Him, and turn away from all them that repudiate His truth. Let God, Thy Lord, be Thy sufficing succourer and helper. We have pledged Ourself to secure Thy triumph upon earth and to exalt Our Cause above all men, though no king be found who would turn his face towards Thee.\n\nCall Thou to remembrance Thine arrival in the City, how the Ministers of the Sul?an thought Thee to be unacquainted with their laws and regulations, and believed Thee to be one of the ignorant. Say: Yea, by My Lord! I am ignorant of all things except what God hath, through His bountiful favour, been pleased to teach Me. To this We assuredly testify, and unhesitatingly confess it.\n\nSay: If the laws and regulations to which ye cleave be of your own making, We will, in no wise, follow them. Thus have I been instructed by Him Who is the All-Wise, the All-Informed. Such hath been My way in the past, and such will it remain in the future, through the power of God and His might. This, indeed, is the true and right way. If they be ordained by God, bring forth, then, your proofs, if ye be of them that speak the truth. Say: We have written down in a Book which leaveth not unrecorded the work of any man, however insignificant, all that they have imputed to Thee, and all that they have done unto Thee.\n\nSay: It behoveth you, O Ministers of State, to keep the precepts of God, and to forsake your own laws and regulations, and to be of them who are guided aright. Better is this for you than all ye possess, did ye but know it. If ye transgress the commandment of God, not one jot or one tittle of all your works shall be acceptable in His sight. Ye shall, erelong, discover the consequences of that which ye shall have done in this vain life, and shall be repaid for them. This, verily, is the truth, the undoubted truth.\n\nHow great the number of those who, in bygone ages, have committed the things ye have committed, and who, though superior to you in rank, have, in the end, returned unto dust, and been consigned to their inevitable doom! Would that ye might ponder the Cause of God in your hearts! Ye shall follow in their wake, and shall be made to enter a habitation wherein none shall be found to befriend or help you. Ye shall, of a truth, be asked of your doings, shall be called to account for your failure in duty with regard to the Cause of God, and for having disdainfully rejected His loved ones who, with manifest sincerity, have come unto you.\n\nIt is ye who have taken counsel together regarding them, ye that have preferred to follow the promptings of your own desires, and forsaken the commandment of God, the Help in Peril, the Almighty.\n\nSay: What! Cleave ye to your own devices, and cast behind your backs the precepts of God? Ye, indeed, have wronged your own selves and others. Would that ye could perceive it! Say: If your rules and principles be founded on justice, why is it, then, that ye follow those which accord with your corrupt inclinations and reject such as conflict with your desires? By what right claim ye, then, to judge fairly between men? Are your rules and principles such as to justify your persecution of Him Who, at your bidding, hath presented Himself before you, your rejection of Him, and your infliction on Him every day of grievous injury? Hath He ever, though it be for one short moment, disobeyed you? All the inhabitants of 'Iraq, and beyond them every discerning observer, will bear witness to the truth of My words.\n\nBe fair in your judgement, O ye Ministers of State! What is it that We have committed that could justify Our banishment? What is the offence that hath warranted Our expulsion? It is We Who have sought you, and yet, behold how ye refused to receive Us! By God! This is a sore injustice that ye have perpetrated--an injustice with which no earthly injustice can measure. To this the Almighty is Himself a witness.\n\nHave I at any time transgressed your laws, or disobeyed any of your ministers in 'Iraq? Inquire of them, that ye may act with discernment towards Us and be numbered with those who are well-informed. Hath anyone ever brought before them a plaint against Us? Hath anyone amongst them ever heard from Us a word contrary to that which God hath revealed in His Book? Bring forth, then, your evidence, that We may approve your actions and acknowledge your claims!\n\nHad ye wished to deal with Us in accordance with your principles and standards, it would have behoved you to respect and honour Us for complying with your commands and following that which ye have pleased to ordain. Likewise, it would have beseemed you to repay the debts which We incurred in 'Iraq in the execution of your wishes. Ye should have given ear then unto Us, heard the account of Our woes, and judged with equity, as ye would judge your own selves. Ye should not have wished for Us that which ye have not wished for yourselves, but rather chosen to act with generosity. By God! Ye dealt with Us neither in accordance with your own principles and standards, nor with those of any man living, but in accordance with the promptings of your evil and wayward passions, O ye concourse of the froward and the arrogant!\n\nO Bird of Holiness! Soar in the heaven of communion with Me, and acquaint the people with that which We disclosed unto Thee in the billowing oceans of immortality beyond the mount of glory. Let the fear of no one dismay Thee, and put Thy trust in God, the Almighty, the Beneficent. We, verily, shall protect Thee from those who, without a clear token from God or an enlightening Book, have grievously wronged Thee.\n\nSay: God is My witness, O concourse of the negligent! We came not unto you to spread disorder in your lands or to sow dissension amongst your peoples. Nay rather, We came in obedience to the command of the sovereign, and in order to exalt your authority, to instruct you in the ways of Our wisdom, and to remind you of that which ye had forgotten--even as He saith in truth: \"Warn them, for, in truth, Thy warning will profit the believers.\" But ye hearkened not unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit, and gave ear unwittingly unto Our enemies, they who follow the promptings of their corrupt inclinations, whose deeds the Evil One hath made fair-seeming in their own eyes, and whose tongues utter calumnies against Us. Heard ye not that which hath been revealed in His all-glorious and unerring Book: \"If a wicked man come to you with news, clear it up at once\"? Wherefore have ye then cast the command of God behind your backs, and followed in the footsteps of them that are bent on mischief?\n\nWe have heard that one of these calumniators hath alleged that this Servant practised usury whilst residing in 'Iraq, and was engaged in amassing riches for Himself. Say: How can ye judge a matter whereof ye have no knowledge? How can ye hurl calumnies against the servants of God, and entertain such evil suspicions? And how could this accusation be true, when God hath forbidden this practice unto His servants in that most holy and well-guarded Book revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets, a Book which He hath ordained to be His abiding testimony, and His guidance and monition unto all mankind? This is but one of the matters in which We have opposed the divines of Persia, inasmuch as We have, according to the text of the Book, forbidden unto all men the practice of usury. God Himself beareth witness to the truth of My words. \"Yet I hold not myself clear, for the soul is prone to evil.\" We intend only to impart unto you the truth, that ye might be informed thereof and be of them that lead a godly life. Beware lest ye give ear to the words of those from whom the foul smell of malice and envy can be discerned; pay no heed to them, and stand ye for righteousness.\n\nKnow ye that the world and its vanities and its embellishments shall pass away. Nothing will endure except God's Kingdom which pertaineth to none but Him, the Sovereign Lord of all, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Almighty. The days of your life shall roll away, and all the things with which ye are occupied and of which ye boast yourselves shall perish, and ye shall, most certainly, be summoned by a company of His angels to appear at the spot where the limbs of the entire creation shall be made to tremble, and the flesh of every oppressor to creep. Ye shall be asked of the things your hands have wrought in this, your vain life, and shall be repaid for your doings. This is the day that shall inevitably come upon you, the hour that none can put back. To this the Tongue of Him that speaketh the truth and is the Knower of all things hath testified.\n\nFear God, ye inhabitants of the City, and sow not the seeds of dissension amongst men. Walk not in the paths of the Evil One. Walk ye, during the few remaining days of your life, in the ways of the one true God. Your days shall pass away as have the days of them who were before you. To dust shall ye return, even as your fathers of old did return.\n\nKnow ye that I am afraid of none except God. In none but Him have I placed My trust; to none will I cleave but Him, and wish for naught except the thing He hath wished for Me. This, indeed, is My heart's desire, did ye but know it. I have offered up My soul and My body as a sacrifice for God, the Lord of all worlds. Whoso hath known God shall know none but Him, and he that feareth God shall be afraid of no one except Him, though the powers of the whole earth rise up and be arrayed against him. I speak naught except at His bidding, and follow naught, through the power of God and His might, except His truth. He, verily, shall recompense the truthful.\n\nNarrate, O Servant, the things Thou didst behold at the time of Thine arrival in the City, that Thy testimony may endure amongst men, and serve as a warning unto them that believe. We found, upon Our arrival in the City, its governors and elders as children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay. We perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire from Us the truths which God hath taught Us, nor ripe for Our wondrous words of wisdom. Our inner eye wept sore over them, and over their transgressions and their total disregard of the thing for which they were created. This is what We observed in that city, and which We have chosen to note down in Our Book, that it may serve as a warning unto them, and unto the rest of mankind.\n\nSay: If ye be seekers after this life and the vanities thereof, ye should have sought them while ye were still enclosed in your mothers' wombs, for at that time ye were continually approaching them, could ye but perceive it. Ye have, on the other hand, ever since ye were born and attained maturity, been all the while receding from the world and drawing closer to dust. Why, then, exhibit such greed in amassing the treasures of the earth, when your days are numbered and your chance is well-nigh lost? Will ye not, then, O heedless ones, shake off your slumber?\n\nIncline your ears to the counsels which this Servant giveth you for the sake of God. He, verily, asketh no recompense from you and is resigned to what God hath ordained for Him, and is entirely submissive to God's Will.\n\nThe days of your life are far spent, O people, and your end is fast approaching. Put away, therefore, the things ye have devised and to which ye cleave, and take firm hold on the precepts of God, that haply ye may attain that which He hath purposed for you, and be of them that pursue a right course. Delight not yourselves in the things of the world and its vain ornaments, neither set your hopes on them. Let your reliance be on the remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. He will, erelong, bring to naught all the things ye possess. Let Him be your fear, and forget not His covenant with you, and be not of them that are shut out as by a veil from Him.\n\nBeware that ye swell not with pride before God, and disdainfully reject His loved ones. Defer ye humbly to the faithful, they that have believed in God and in His signs, whose hearts witness to His unity, whose tongues proclaim His oneness, and who speak not except by His leave. Thus do We exhort you with justice, and warn you with truth, that perchance ye may be awakened.\n\nLay not on any soul a load which ye would not wish to be laid upon you, and desire not for anyone the things ye would not desire for yourselves. This is My best counsel unto you, did ye but observe it.\n\nRespect ye the divines and learned amongst you, they whose conduct accords with their professions, who transgress not the bounds which God hath fixed, whose judgements are in conformity with His behests as revealed in His Book. Know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are in the heavens and on the earth. They who disregard and neglect the divines and learned that live amongst them--these have truly changed the favour with which God hath favoured them.\n\nSay: Wait ye till God will have changed His favour unto you. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Him. He knoweth the secrets both of the heavens and of the earth. His knowledge embraceth all things. Rejoice not in what ye have done, or will do in the future, nor delight in the tribulation with which ye have afflicted Us, for ye are unable by such means as these to exalt your stations, were ye to examine your works with acute discernment. Neither will ye be capable of detracting from the loftiness of Our state. Nay, God will add unto the recompense with which He shall reward Us, for having sustained with persevering patience the tribulations We have suffered. He, verily, shall increase the reward of them that endure with patience.\n\nKnow ye that trials and tribulations have, from time immemorial, been the lot of the chosen Ones of God and His beloved, and such of His servants as are detached from all else but Him, they whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of the Almighty, they that speak not till He hath spoken, and act according to His commandment. Such is God's method carried into effect of old, and such will it remain in the future. Blessed are the steadfastly enduring, they that are patient under ills and hardships, who lament not over anything that befalleth them, and who tread the path of resignation.\n\nThat which hath befallen Us hath been witnessed before. Ours is not the first goblet dashed to the ground in the lands of Islam, nor is this the first time that such schemers have intrigued against the beloved of the Lord. The tribulations We have sustained are like unto the trials endured aforetime by Imam Husayn. For he was approached by messengers from malicious and evil-hearted plotters, inviting him to come forth from the city; yet when he came unto them, accompanied by his kindred, they rose up against him with all their might, until at last they slew him, slaughtered his sons and his brothers, and took captive the remainder of his family. So did it come to pass in an earlier age, and God, verily, is a witness unto My words. Of his lineage there survived none, whether young or old, save his son 'Ali al-Awsat, known as Zaynu'l-'Abidin.\n\nBehold then, O heedless ones, how brightly the fire of the love of God blazed aforetime in the heart of Husayn, if ye be of them that ponder! So intense grew its flame that fervour and longing at last seized the reins of patience from his grasp, and the love of Him Who is the All-Compelling so enraptured his heart that he surrendered his soul, his spirit, his substance, and his all in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. By God! Sweeter was this in his sight than the empire of earth and heaven. For the true lover desireth naught save reunion with his beloved and the seeker hath no goal but to attain unto the object of his quest. Their hearts long for reunion even as the body yearneth for the spirit, nay greater indeed is their longing, could ye but perceive it!\n\nSay: That same fire now blazeth in Mine own breast, and My wish is that this Husayn may lay down His life in like manner, in the hope of attaining unto so august and sublime a station, that station wherein the servant dieth to himself and liveth in God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Great. Were I to disclose unto you the mysteries which God hath enshrined therein, ye would, of a truth, offer up your lives in His path, renounce your riches, and forsake all that ye possess, that ye might attain this transcendent and all-glorious station. God, however, hath veiled your hearts and obscured your eyes, lest ye should apprehend His mysteries and be made aware of their meaning.\n\nSay: The sincere soul longeth for nearness to God even as the suckling babe yearneth for its mother's breast, nay more ardent is his longing, could ye but know it! Again, his longing is even as the panting of one sore athirst after the living waters of grace, or the yearning of the sinner for forgiveness and mercy. Thus do We expound unto you the mysteries of the Cause, and impart unto you what shall render you independent of all that hath so far occupied you, that perchance ye may enter the Court of Holiness within this exalted Paradise. I swear by God! Whoso entereth therein shall never abandon its precincts, and whoso gazeth thereon shall never turn away therefrom, even should the swords of infidels and deniers rain blows upon him. Thus have We related unto you that which befell Husayn, and We beseech God that He may destine for Us that which He had decreed for him. He, verily, is the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful.\n\nBy the righteousness of God! Through his deed the fragrances of holiness were wafted over all things, the proof of God was perfected, and His testimony made manifest to all men. And after him God raised up a people who avenged his death, who slew his enemies, and who wept over him at dawn and at eventide. Say: God hath pledged in His Book to lay hold upon every oppressor for his tyranny, and to uproot the stirrers of mischief. Know ye that such holy deeds exert, in themselves, a great influence upon the world of being--an influence which is, however, inscrutable to all save those whose eyes have been opened by God, whose hearts He hath freed from obscuring veils, and whose souls He hath guided aright.\n\nThe day is approaching when God will have raised up a people who will call to remembrance Our days, who will tell the tale of Our trials, who will demand the restitution of Our rights from them that, without a tittle of evidence, have treated Us with manifest injustice. God, assuredly, dominateth the lives of them that wronged Us, and is well aware of their doings. He will, most certainly, lay hold on them for their sins. He, verily, is the fiercest of avengers.\n\nThus have We recounted unto you the tales of the one true God, and sent down unto you the things He had preordained, that haply ye may ask forgiveness of Him, may return unto Him, may truly repent, may realize your misdeeds, may shake off your slumber, may be roused from your heedlessness, may atone for the things that have escaped you, and be of them that do good. Let him who will, acknowledge the truth of My words; and as to him that willeth not, let him turn aside. My sole duty is to remind you of your failure in duty towards the Cause of God, if perchance ye may be of them that heed My warning. Wherefore, hearken ye unto My speech, and return ye to God and repent, that He, through His grace, may have mercy upon you, may wash away your sins, and forgive your trespasses. The greatness of His mercy surpasseth the fury of His wrath, and His grace encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with the robe of life, be they of the past or of the future.\n\nO concourse of Ministers of State! Do ye believe in your hearts that We have come to divest you of your earthly possessions and vanities? Nay, by the One in Whose hand is My soul! Our intention hath been to make clear that We oppose not the commands of the sovereign, nor are We to be numbered with the rebellious. Know ye of a certainty that all the treasures of the earth, all the gold, the silver, and the rare and precious gems they contain, are, in the sight of God, of His chosen ones and His loved ones, as worthless as a handful of clay. For erelong all that is on earth shall perish, and the kingdom will remain unto God, the All-Powerful, the Incomparable. That which perisheth can never profit Us, nor can it profit you, were ye but to reflect.\n\nBy the righteousness of God! I speak not falsely, and utter naught save that which God hath bidden Me. To this bear witness the very words of this Tablet, if ye but reflect upon its contents. Follow not the promptings of your own desires, nor the whisperings of the Evil One in your souls. Follow rather the Cause of God, both in your outward and your inner lives, and be not of the heedless. Better is this for you than all that ye have laid up in your houses, and all that ye have sought by day and night.\n\nThe world will pass away, and so will all the things whereat your hearts rejoice, or wherein ye pride yourselves before men. Cleanse the mirrors of your hearts from the dross of the world and all that is therein, that they may reflect the resplendent light of God. This, indeed, shall enable you to dispense with all save God, and to attain unto the good pleasure of your Lord, the Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We, verily, have unfolded before your eyes that which shall profit you both in this world and in the realm of faith, and which will lead you to the path of salvation. Would that ye might turn thereunto!\n\nHearken, O King, to the speech of Him that speaketh the truth, Him that doth not ask thee to recompense Him with the things God hath chosen to bestow upon thee, Him Who unerringly treadeth the straight Path. He it is Who summoneth thee unto God, thy Lord, Who showeth thee the right course, the way that leadeth to true felicity, that haply thou mayest be of them with whom it shall be well.\n\nBeware, O King, that thou gather not around thee such ministers as follow the desires of a corrupt inclination, as have cast behind their backs that which hath been committed into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust. Be bounteous to others as God hath been bounteous to thee, and abandon not the interests of thy people to the mercy of such ministers as these. Lay not aside the fear of God, and be thou of them that act uprightly. Gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive the fragrance of faith and of justice, and take thou counsel with them, and choose whatever is best in thy sight, and be of them that act generously.\n\nKnow thou for a certainty that whoso disbelieveth in God is neither trustworthy nor truthful. This, indeed, is the truth, the undoubted truth. He that acteth treacherously towards God will, also, act treacherously towards his king. Nothing whatever can deter such a man from evil, nothing can hinder him from betraying his neighbour, nothing can induce him to walk uprightly.\n\nTake heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of thy state into the hands of others, and repose not thy confidence in ministers unworthy of thy trust, and be not of them that live in heedlessness. Shun them whose hearts are turned away from thee, and place not thy confidence in them, and entrust them not with thine affairs and the affairs of such as profess thy faith. Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of God's flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest their devices and mischief hurt thee. Turn away from them, and fix thy gaze upon God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful. He that giveth up himself wholly to God, God shall, assuredly, be with him; and he that placeth his complete trust in God, God shall, verily, protect him from whatsoever may harm him, and shield him from the wickedness of every evil plotter.\n\nWert thou to incline thine ear unto My speech and observe My counsel, God would exalt thee to so eminent a position that the designs of no man on the whole earth can ever touch or hurt thee. Observe, O King, with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts of God, and walk not in the paths of the oppressor. Seize thou, and hold firmly within the grasp of thy might, the reins of the affairs of thy people, and examine in person whatever pertaineth unto them. Let nothing escape thee, for therein lieth the highest good.\n\nRender thanks unto God for having chosen thee out of the whole world, and made thee king over them that profess thy faith. It well beseemeth thee to appreciate the wondrous favours with which God hath favoured thee, and to magnify continually His name. Thou canst best praise Him if thou lovest His loved ones, and dost safeguard and protect His servants from the mischief of the treacherous, that none may any longer oppress them. Thou shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of God amongst them, that thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in His law.\n\nShouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy subjects, God would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of the seen, and would strengthen thee in thine affairs. No God is there but Him. All creation and its empire are His. Unto Him return the works of the faithful.\n\nPlace not thy reliance on thy treasures. Put thy whole confidence in the grace of God, thy Lord. Let Him be thy trust in whatever thou doest, and be of them that have submitted themselves to His Will. Let Him be thy helper and enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth. He bestoweth them upon whom He will, and from whom He will He withholdeth them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Possessing, the All-Praised. All are but paupers at the door of His mercy; all are helpless before the revelation of His sovereignty, and beseech His favours.\n\nOverstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that serve thee. Bestow upon them according to their needs, and not to the extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves, to deck their persons, to embellish their homes, to acquire the things that are of no benefit unto them, and to be numbered with the extravagant. Deal with them with undeviating justice, so that none among them may either suffer want, or be pampered with luxuries. This is but manifest justice.\n\nAllow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and worthy of honour, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy of the contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon Our arrival in the City, and to it We bear witness. We found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches, while others were in dire want and abject poverty. This ill beseemeth thy sovereignty, and is unworthy of thy rank.\n\nLet My counsel be acceptable to thee, and strive thou to rule with equity among men, that God may exalt thy name and spread abroad the fame of thy justice in all the world. Beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the expense of thy subjects. Fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright in heart who, at every break of day, bewail their plight, and be unto them a benignant sovereign. They, verily, are thy treasures on earth. It behoveth thee, therefore, to safeguard thy treasures from the assaults of them who wish to rob thee. Inquire into their affairs, and ascertain, every year, nay every month, their condition, and be not of them that are careless of their duty.\n\nSet before thine eyes God's unerring Balance and, as one standing in His Presence, weigh in that Balance thine actions every day, every moment of thy life. Bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to a reckoning, on the Day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of God, the Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble.\n\nIt behoveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun, which fostereth the growth of all beings, and giveth to each its due, whose benefits are not inherent in itself, but are ordained by Him Who is the Most Powerful, the Almighty. The King should be as generous, as liberal in his mercy as the clouds, the outpourings of whose bounty are showered upon every land, by the behest of Him Who is the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Knowing.\n\nHave a care not to entrust thine affairs of state entirely into another's hands. None can discharge thy functions better than thine own self. Thus do We make clear unto thee Our words of wisdom, and send down upon thee that which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of oppression to the right hand of justice, and approach the resplendent ocean of His favours. Such is the path which the kings that were before thee have trodden, they that acted equitably towards their subjects, and walked in the ways of undeviating justice.\n\nThou art God's shadow on earth. Strive, therefore, to act in such a manner as befitteth so eminent, so august a station. If thou dost depart from following the things We have caused to descend upon thee and taught thee, thou wilt, assuredly, be derogating from that great and priceless honour. Return, then, and cleave wholly unto God, and cleanse thine heart from the world and all its vanities, and suffer not the love of any stranger to enter and dwell therein. Not until thou dost purify thine heart from every trace of such love can the brightness of the light of God shed its radiance upon it, for to none hath God given more than one heart. This, verily, hath been decreed and written down in His ancient Book. And as the human heart, as fashioned by God, is one and undivided, it behoveth thee to take heed that its affections be, also, one and undivided. Cleave thou, therefore, with the whole affection of thine heart, unto His love, and withdraw it from the love of anyone besides Him, that He may aid thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a true upholder of His oneness. God is My witness. My sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory things of the earth, and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory, that thou mayest, by the leave of God, be of them that abide and rule therein.\n\nHast thou heard, O King, what We have suffered at the hands of thy ministers and how We have been treated by them, or art thou of the negligent? If indeed thou hast heard and known, wherefore didst thou not forbid thy ministers to commit such deeds? How didst thou desire for Him Who hath complied with thy command, and been obedient to thy behest, that which no king would desire for any of his subjects? And if thou knowest not, this indeed is a more grievous error, wert thou of the God-fearing. Wherefore shall I recount to thee that which We have suffered at the hands of these oppressors.\n\nKnow, then, that We came unto thy city at thine own behest, and entered therein with conspicuous honour. They expelled Us, however, from thy city with an abasement with which no abasement on earth can compare, if thou be of them that are well-informed. They made Us journey until We reached the place which none entereth except such as have rebelled against the authority of the sovereign, and as are numbered with the transgressors. All this, notwithstanding that We had never disobeyed thee, though it be for a single moment, for when We heard thy bidding We observed it and submitted to thy will. In dealing with Us, however, thy ministers neither honoured the standards of God and His commandments, nor heeded that which hath been revealed to the Prophets and Messengers. They showed Us no mercy and committed against Us that which no one among the faithful hath ever wrought against his fellow, nor any believer inflicted upon an infidel. God knoweth and is a witness unto the truth of Our words.\n\nWhen they expelled Us from thy city, they placed Us in such conveyances as the people use to carry baggage and the like. Such was the treatment We received at their hands, shouldst thou wish to know the truth. Thus were We sent away, and thus were We brought to the city which they regard as the abode of rebels. Upon our arrival, We could find no house in which to dwell, and perforce resided in a place where none would enter save the most indigent stranger. There We lodged for a time, after which, suffering increasingly from the confined space, We sought and rented houses which by reason of the extreme cold had been vacated by their occupants. Thus in the depth of winter we were constrained to make our abode in houses wherein none dwell except in the heat of summer. Neither My family, nor those who accompanied Me, had the necessary raiment to protect them from the cold in that freezing weather.\n\nWould that thy ministers had dealt with Us according to the principles they uphold amongst themselves! For, by God, they dealt with Us neither in accordance with the commandments of God, nor with the practices they uphold, nor with the standards current amongst men, nor even with the manner in which the destitute of the earth receive a wayfarer. Such is the account of what We suffered at their hands, and which We have related unto thee in a language of truthfulness and sincerity.\n\nAll this befell Me, though I had come unto them at their own behest and did not oppose their authority, which deriveth from thine own. Thus did We accept and observe their bidding. They, however, appear to have forgotten that which God hath commanded. He saith, and His Word is the truth: \"Act with humility towards the believers.\" Methinks that their only concern was their own comfort and repose, and that their ears were deaf to the sighs of the poor and the cries of the oppressed. They seem to imagine that they have been created from pure light, while others have been fashioned out of dust. How wretched are their imaginings! We have all been created from a sorry germ.\n\nI swear by God, O King! It is not My wish to make My plaint to thee against them that persecute Me. I only plead My grief and My sorrow to God, Who hath created Me and them, Who well knoweth our state and Who watcheth over all things. My wish is to warn them of the consequences of their actions, if perchance they might desist from treating others as they have treated Me, and be of them that heed My warning.\n\nThe tribulations that have touched Us, the destitution from which We suffer, the various troubles with which We are encompassed, shall all pass away, as shall pass away the pleasures in which they delight and the affluence they enjoy. This is the truth which no man on earth can reject. The days in which We have been compelled to dwell in the dust will soon be ended, as will the days in which they occupied the seats of honour. God shall, assuredly, judge with truth between Us and them, and He, verily, is the best of judges.\n\nWe render thanks unto God for whatsoever hath befallen Us, and We patiently endure the things He hath ordained in the past or will ordain in the future. In Him have I placed My trust; and into His hands have I committed My Cause. He will, certainly, repay all them that endure with patience and put their confidence in Him. His is the creation and its empire. He exalteth whom He will, and whom He will He doth abase. He shall not be asked of His doings. He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the Almighty.\n\nLet thine ear be attentive, O King, to the words We have addressed to thee. Let the oppressor desist from his tyranny, and cut off the perpetrators of injustice from among them that profess thy faith. By the righteousness of God! The tribulations We have sustained are such that any pen that recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish. No one of them that truly believe and uphold the unity of God can bear the burden of their recital. So great have been Our sufferings that even the eyes of Our enemies have wept over Us, and beyond them those of every discerning person. And to all these trials have We been subjected, in spite of Our action in approaching thee, and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy shadow, that thou mightest be a stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold the unity of God.\n\nHave I, O King, ever disobeyed thee? Have I, at any time, transgressed any of thy laws? Can any of thy ministers that represented thee in 'Iraq produce any proof that can establish My disloyalty to thee? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds! Not for one short moment did We rebel against thee, or against any of thy ministers. Never, God willing, shall We revolt against thee, though We be exposed to trials more severe than any We suffered in the past.\n\nIn the daytime and in the night season, at even and at morn, We pray to God on thy behalf, that He may graciously aid thee to be obedient unto Him and to observe His commandment, that He may shield thee from the hosts of the evil ones. Do, therefore, as it pleaseth thee, and treat Us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty. Be not forgetful of the law of God in whatever thou desirest to achieve, now or in the days to come. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!\n\nDost thou imagine, O Minister of the Shah in the City, that I hold within My grasp the ultimate destiny of the Cause of God? Thinkest thou that My imprisonment, or the shame I have been made to suffer, or even My death and utter annihilation, can deflect its course? Wretched is what thou hast imagined in thine heart! Thou art indeed of them that walk after the vain imaginings which their hearts devise. No God is there but Him. Powerful is He to manifest His Cause, and to exalt His testimony, and to establish whatsoever is His Will, and to elevate it to so eminent a position that neither thine own hands, nor the hands of them that have turned away from Him, can ever touch or harm it.\n\nDost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate His Will, to hinder Him from executing His judgement, or to deter Him from exercising His sovereignty? Pretendest thou that aught in the heavens or in the earth can resist His Faith? Nay, by Him Who is the Eternal Truth! Nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart His Purpose. Cast away, therefore, the mere conceit thou dost follow, for mere conceit can never take the place of truth. Be thou of them that have truly repented and returned to God, the God Who hath created thee, Who hath nourished thee, and made thee a minister among them that profess thy faith.\n\nKnow thou, moreover, that He it is Who hath, by His own behest, created all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. How can, then, the thing that hath been created at His bidding prevail against Him? High is God exalted above what ye imagine about Him, ye people of malice! If this Cause be of God, no man can prevail against it; and if it be not of God, the divines amongst you, and they that follow their corrupt desires and such as have rebelled against Him will surely suffice to overpower it.\n\nHast thou not heard what a man of the family of Pharaoh, a believer, hath said of old, and which God recounted unto His Apostle, Whom He hath chosen above all human beings, and entrusted with His Message, and made the source of His mercy unto all them that dwell on earth? He said, and He, verily, speaketh the truth: \"Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission? And if he be a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he be a man of truth, part at least of what he threateneth will fall upon you.\" This is what God hath revealed unto His Well-Beloved One, in His unerring Book.\n\nAnd yet, ye have failed to incline your ears unto His bidding, have disregarded His law, have rejected His counsel as recorded in His Book, and have been of them that have strayed far from Him. How many those who, every year, and every month, have because of you been put to death! How manifold the injustices ye have perpetrated--injustices the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, which no chronicler hath ever recorded! How numerous the babes and sucklings who were made orphans, and the fathers who lost their sons, because of your cruelty, O ye unjust doers! How oft hath a sister pined away and mourned over her brother, and how oft hath a wife lamented after her husband and sole sustainer!\n\nYour iniquity waxed greater and greater until ye slew Him Who had never taken His eyes away from the face of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Would that ye had put Him to death after the manner men are wont to put one another to death! Ye slew Him, however, in such circumstances as no man hath ever witnessed. The heavens wept sore over Him, and the souls of them who are nigh unto God cried out for His affliction. Was He not a Scion of your Prophet's ancient House? Had not His fame as a direct descendant of the Apostle been spread abroad amongst you? Why, then, did ye inflict upon Him what no man, however far ye may look back, hath inflicted upon another? By God! The eye of creation hath never beheld your like. Ye slay Him Who is a Scion of your Prophet's House, and rejoice and make merry while seated on your seats of honour! Ye utter your imprecations against them who were before you, and who have perpetrated what ye have perpetrated, and remain yourselves all the time unaware of your enormities!\n\nBe fair in your judgement. Did they whom ye curse, upon whom ye invoke evil, act differently from yourselves? Have they not slain the descendant of their Prophet as ye have slain the descendant of your own? Is not your conduct similar to their conduct? Wherefore, then, claim ye to be different from them, O ye sowers of dissension amongst men?\n\nAnd when ye took away His life, one of His followers arose to avenge His death. He was unknown of men, and the design he had conceived was unnoticed by anyone. Eventually he committed what had been preordained. It behoveth you, therefore, to attach blame to no one except to yourselves, for the things ye have committed, if ye but judge fairly. Who is there on the whole earth who hath done what ye have done? None, by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds!\n\nAll the rulers and kings of the earth honour and revere the descendants of their Prophets and holy men, could ye but perceive it. Ye, on the other hand, are responsible for such acts as no man hath, at any time, performed. Your misdeeds have caused every understanding heart to be consumed with grief. And yet, ye have remained sunk in your heedlessness, and failed to realize the wickedness of your actions.\n\nYe have persisted in your waywardness until ye rose up against Us, though We had committed nothing to justify your enmity. Fear ye not God Who hath created you, and fashioned you, and caused you to attain your strength, and joined you with them that have resigned themselves to Him? How long will ye persist in your waywardness? How long will ye refuse to reflect? How long ere ye shake off your slumber and are roused from your heedlessness? How long will ye remain unaware of the truth?\n\nPonder in thine heart. Did ye, notwithstanding your behaviour and the things your hands have wrought, succeed in quenching the fire of God or in putting out the light of His Revelation--a light that hath enveloped with its brightness them that are immersed in the billowing oceans of immortality, and hath attracted the souls of such as truly believe in and uphold His unity? Know ye not that the Hand of God is over your hands, that His Decree transcendeth all your devices, that He is supreme over His servants, that He is equal to His Purpose, that He doth what He wisheth, that He shall not be asked of whatever He willeth, that He ordaineth what He pleaseth, that He is the Most Powerful, the Almighty? If ye believe this to be the truth, wherefore, then, will ye not cease from troubling and be at peace with yourselves?\n\nYe perpetrate every day a fresh injustice, and treat Me as ye treated Me in times past, though I never attempted to meddle with your affairs. At no time have I opposed you, neither have I rebelled against your laws. Behold how ye have, at the last, made Me a prisoner in this far-off land! Know for a certainty, however, that whatever your hands or the hands of the infidels have wrought will never, as they never did of old, change the Cause of God or alter His ways.\n\nGive heed to My warning, ye people of Persia! If I be slain at your hands, God will assuredly raise up one who will fill the seat made vacant through My death, for such is God's method carried into effect of old, and no change can ye find in God's method of dealing. Seek ye to put out God's light that shineth upon His earth? Averse is God from what ye desire. He shall perfect His light, albeit ye abhor it in the secret of your hearts.\n\nPause for but a little while and reflect, O Minister, and be fair in thy judgement. What is it that We have committed that could justify thee in having slandered Us unto the King's Ministers, in following thy desires, in perverting the truth, and in uttering thy calumnies against Us? We have never met each other except when We met thee in thy father's house, in the days when the martyrdom of Imam Husayn was being commemorated. On those occasions no one could have had the chance of making known to others his views and beliefs in conversation or in discourse. Thou wilt bear witness to the truth of My words, if thou be of the truthful. I have frequented no other gatherings in which thou couldst have learned My mind or in which any other could have done so. How, then, didst thou pronounce thy verdict against Me, when thou hadst not heard My testimony from Mine own lips? Hast thou not heard what God, exalted be His glory, hath said: \"Say not to everyone who meeteth you with a greeting, 'Thou art not a believer'.\" \"Thrust not away those who cry to their Lord at morn and even, craving to behold His face.\" Thou hast indeed forsaken what the Book of God hath prescribed, and yet thou deemest thyself to be a believer!\n\nDespite what thou hast done I entertain--and to this God is My witness--no ill will against thee, nor against anyone, though from thee and others We receive such hurt as no believer in the unity of God can sustain. My cause is in the hand of none except God, and My trust is in no one else but Him. Erelong shall your days pass away, as shall pass away the days of those who now, with flagrant pride, vaunt themselves over their neighbour. Soon shall ye be gathered together in the presence of God, and shall be asked of your doings, and shall be repaid for what your hands have wrought, and wretched is the abode of the wicked doers!\n\nBy God! Wert thou to realize what thou hast done, thou wouldst surely weep sore over thyself, and wouldst flee for refuge to God, and wouldst pine away and mourn all the days of thy life, till God will have forgiven thee, for He, verily, is the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful. Thou wilt, however, persist, till the hour of thy death, in thy heedlessness, inasmuch as thou hast, with all thine heart, thy soul and inmost being, busied thyself with the vanities of the world. Thou shalt, after thy departure, discover what We have revealed unto thee, and shalt find all thy doings recorded in the Book wherein the works of all them that dwell on earth, be they greater or less than the weight of an atom, are noted down. Heed, therefore, My counsel, and hearken thou, with the hearing of thine heart, unto My speech, and be not careless of My words, nor be of them that reject My truth. Glory not in the things that have been given thee. Set before thine eyes what hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious: \"And when they had forgotten their warnings, We set open to them the gates of all things,\" even as We did set open to thee and to thy like the gates of this earth and the ornaments thereof. Wait thou, therefore, for what hath been promised in the latter part of this holy verse, for this is a promise from Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise--a promise that will not prove untrue.\n\nI know not the path ye have chosen and which ye tread, O congregation of My ill-wishers! We summon you to God, We remind you of His Day, We announce unto you tidings of your reunion with Him, We draw you nigh unto His court, and send down upon you tokens of His wondrous wisdom, and yet lo, behold how ye reject Us, how ye condemn Us, through the things which your lying mouths have uttered, as an infidel, how ye devise your devices against Us! And when We manifest unto you what God hath, through His bountiful favour, bestowed upon Us, ye say, \"It is but plain magic.\" The same words were spoken by the generations that were before you and were what ye are, did ye but perceive it. Ye have thereby deprived yourselves of the bounty of God and of His grace, and shall never obtain them till the day when God will have judged between Us and you, and He, verily, is the best of judges.\n\n101tCertain ones among you have said: \"He it is Who hath laid claim to be God.\" By God! This is a gross calumny. I am but a servant of God Who hath believed in Him and in His signs, and in His Prophets and in His angels. My tongue, and My heart, and My inner and My outer being testify that there is no God but Him, that all others have been created by His behest, and been fashioned through the operation of His Will. There is none other God but Him, the Creator, the Raiser from the dead, the Quickener, the Slayer. I am He that telleth abroad the favours with which God hath, through His bounty, favoured Me. If this be My transgression, then I am truly the first of the transgressors. I and My kindred are at your mercy. Do ye as ye please, and be not of them that hesitate, that I might return to God My Lord, and reach the place where I can no longer behold your faces. This, indeed, is My dearest wish, My most ardent desire. Of My state God is, verily, sufficiently informed, observant.\n\n102tImagine thyself to be under the eye of God, O Minister! If thou seest Him not, He, in truth, clearly seeth thee. Observe, and judge fairly Our Cause. What is it that We have committed that could have induced thee to rise up against Us, and to slander Us to the people, if thou be of them who are just? We departed out of Tihran, at the bidding of the King, and, by his leave, transferred Our residence to 'Iraq. If I had transgressed against him, why, then, did he release Me? And if I were innocent of guilt, wherefore did ye afflict Us with such tribulation as none among them that profess your faith hath suffered? Hath any of Mine acts, after Mine arrival in 'Iraq, been such as to subvert the authority of the government? Who is it that can be said to have detected anything reprehensible in Our behaviour? Enquire for thyself of its people, that thou mayest be of them who have discerned the truth.\n\nFor eleven years We dwelt in that land, until the Minister representing thy government arrived, whose name Our pen is loth to mention, who was given to wine, who followed his lusts, and committed wickedness, and was corrupt and corrupted 'Iraq. To this will bear witness most of the inhabitants of Baghdad, wert thou to inquire of them, and be of such as seek the truth. He it was who wrongfully seized the substance of his fellow-men, who forsook all the commandments of God, and perpetrated whatever God had forbidden. Eventually, he, following his desires, rose up against Us, and walked in the ways of the unjust. He accused Us, in his letter to thee, and thou didst believe him and followed in his way, without seeking any proof or trustworthy evidence from him. Thou didst ask for no explanation, nor didst thou attempt either to investigate or ascertain the matter, that the truth might be distinguished from falsehood in thy sight, and that thou mightest be clear in thy discernment. Find out for thyself the sort of man he was by asking those Ministers who were, at that time, in 'Iraq, as well as the Governor of the City and its high Counsellor, that the truth may be revealed to thee, and that thou mayest be of the well-informed.\n\nGod is Our witness! We have, under no circumstances, opposed either him, or others. We observed, under all conditions, the precepts of God, and were never one of those that wrought disorders. To this he himself doth testify. His intention was to lay hold on Us, and send Us back to Persia, that he might thereby exalt his fame and reputation. Thou hast committed the same crime, and for the self-same purpose. Ye both are of equal grade in the sight of God, the sovereign Lord of all, the All-Knowing.\n\nIt is not Our purpose in addressing to thee these words to lighten the burden of Our woe, or to induce thee to intercede for Us with anyone. Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds! We have set forth the whole matter before thee, that perchance thou might realize what thou hast done, might desist from inflicting on others the hurt thou hast inflicted on Us, and might be of them that have truly repented to God, Who created thee and created all things, and might act with discernment in the future. Better is this for thee than all thou dost possess, than thy ministry whose days are numbered.\n\nBeware lest thou be led to connive at injustice. Set thy heart firmly upon justice, and alter not the Cause of God, and be of them whose eyes are directed towards the things that have been revealed in His Book. Follow not, under any condition, the promptings of thine evil desires. Keep thou the law of God, thy Lord, the Beneficent, the Ancient of Days. Thou shalt most certainly return to dust, and shalt perish like all the things in which thou takest delight. This is what the Tongue of truth and glory hath spoken.\n\nRememberest thou not God's warning uttered in times past, that thou mayest be of them that heed His warning? He said, and He, verily, speaketh the truth: \"From it (earth) have We created you, and unto it will We return you, and out of it will We bring you forth a second time.\" This is what God ordained unto all them that dwell on earth, be they high or low. It behoveth not, therefore, him who was created from dust, who will return unto it, and will again be brought forth out of it, to swell with pride before God, and before His loved ones, to proudly scorn them, and be filled with disdainful arrogance. Nay, rather it behoveth thee and those like thee to submit yourselves to them Who are the Manifestations of the unity of God, and to defer humbly to the faithful, who have forsaken their all for the sake of God, and have detached themselves from the things which engross men's attention, and lead them astray from the path of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Thus do We send down upon you that which shall profit you and profit them that have placed their whole trust and confidence in their Lord.\n\nO ye divines of the City! We came to you with the truth, whilst ye were heedless of it. Methinks ye are as dead, wrapt in the coverings of your own selves. Ye sought not Our presence, when so to do would have been better for you than all your doings. Know ye that the Sun of vicegerency hath dawned in all truth, and yet ye have turned away therefrom. The Moon of guidance hath risen high in the midmost heaven, and yet ye remain veiled therefrom. The Star of divine bounty hath shone forth above the horizon of eternal holiness, and yet ye have strayed far therefrom.\n\nKnow ye, that had your leaders, to whom ye owe allegiance, and on whom ye pride yourselves, and whom ye mention by day and by night, and from whose traces ye seek guidance--had they lived in these days, they would have circled around Me, and would not have separated themselves from Me, whether at eventide or at morn. Ye, however, did not turn your faces towards My face, for even less than a moment, and waxed proud, and were careless of this Wronged One, Who hath been so afflicted by men that they dealt with Him as they pleased. Ye failed to inquire about My condition, nor did ye inform yourselves of the things which befell Me. Thereby have ye withheld from yourselves the winds of holiness, and the breezes of bounty, that blow from this luminous and perspicuous Spot.\n\nMethinks ye have clung to outward things, and forgotten the inner things, and say that which ye do not. Ye are lovers of names, and appear to have given yourselves up to them. For this reason make ye mention of the names of your leaders. And should anyone like them, or superior unto them, come unto you, ye would flee him. Through their names ye have exalted yourselves, and have secured your positions, and live and prosper. And were your leaders to reappear, ye would not renounce your leadership, nor would ye turn in their direction, nor set your faces towards them.\n\nWe found you, as We found most men, worshipping names which they mention during the days of their life, and with which they occupy themselves. No sooner do the Bearers of these names appear, however, than they repudiate them, and turn upon their heels. Thus have We found you, and thus have We reckoned up your actions and borne witness to all your doings in this day. Know ye that God will not, in this day, accept your thoughts, nor your remembrance of Him, nor your turning towards Him, nor your devotions, nor your vigilance, unless ye be made new in the estimation of this Servant, could ye but perceive it.\n\nBy God! The Tree of vicegerency hath been planted, the Point of knowledge hath been made plain, and the sovereignty of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath been established. Fear ye the Lord. Follow not the promptings of your evil desires, but keep the law of God all your days. Renew the rules of the ways ye follow, that ye may be led by the light of guidance and may hasten in the path of the True One.\n\nO ye wise men of the City and philosophers of the world! Beware lest human learning and wisdom cause you to wax proud before God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Know ye that true wisdom is to fear God, to know Him, and to recognize His Manifestations. This wisdom, however, can be attained only by those who detach themselves from the world, and who walk in the ways of the good pleasure of their Lord. Are ye possessed of greater wisdom than the one who contrived a moon which would rise from one well and set in another, and whose light was visible at a distance of three leagues? God, verily, blotted out every trace of his works and returned him unto dust, as ye have already heard or are now informed.\n\nHow many the sages and philosophers who equalled or surpassed him in learning and wisdom! And how vast the number of those who equalled or surpassed yourselves! Some of them believed in God, while others disbelieved and joined partners with Him. The latter were at last cast into the Fire, there to take up their abode, while the former returned unto the mercy of their Lord, therein to abide. For God doth not ask you of your sciences, but of your faith and of your conduct. Are ye greater in wisdom than the One Who brought you into being, Who fashioned the heavens and all that they contain, the earth and all that dwell upon it? Gracious God! True wisdom is His. All creation and its empire are His. He bestoweth His wisdom upon whomsoever He chooseth amongst men, and withholdeth it from whomsoever He desireth. He, in truth, is the Bestower and the Withholder, and He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Wise.\n\nO ye learned of the world! Ye failed to seek Our presence, that ye might hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit and perceive that which God in His bounty hath pleased to bestow upon Me. Verily, this grace hath now escaped you, did ye but know. Had ye sought Our presence, We would have imparted unto you a knowledge that would have rendered you independent of all else. But this ye failed to do, and thus hath the decree of God been fulfilled. Now have I been forbidden to disclose it, since We stand accused of sorcery, if ye perceive Our meaning. The same words were uttered by the deniers of old, men whom death hath long since overtaken and who now dwell in the fire bewailing their plight. The deniers of this day shall likewise meet their doom. Such is the irrevocable decree of Him Who is the All-Powerful, the Self-Sufficient.\n\nI counsel you, in the end, not to overstep the bounds of God, nor to heed the ways and habits of men, for these can neither \"fatten nor appease your hunger\". Fix, rather, your gaze upon the precepts of God. Whosoever desireth, let him accept this counsel as a path leading unto his Lord, and whosoever desireth, let him return to his own idle imaginings. My Lord, verily, is independent above all who are in the heavens and on the earth, and above all that they say and do.\n\nI close with these words uttered by God, exalted be His glory: \"Say not to everyone who meeteth you with a greeting, 'Thou art not a believer'.\"\n\nPeace be upon you, O concourse of the faithful, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00021 ===\n\n=== START BH00022 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise and glory beseem the Lord of all worlds Who hath opened the gates of utterance through letters and made manifest the Purpose through the Word. Exalted be His might! He hath concealed the treasures of inner meanings in the vesture of words and guided the sincere and near ones unto them. Today the ocean of meaning surgeth in every word, and the sun of proof shineth resplendent from the horizon of every utterance. The pen falleth short of describing this station and its position is far beyond the reach of tongue and utterance.\n\nO my God, my Purpose, my Adored One, the All-Bountiful, the All-Merciful! In all things are visible the signs of Thy grace and manifest the tokens of Thy generosity. Have mercy and guide the seekers to their Quest and lead those who aim at their Goal. Though Thy servants are heedless, yet they are weak; though they are remote, yet they are hopeful. The veils of idle fancies have hindered them and the shrouds of vain imaginings have debarred them from drawing nigh. O Generous One! Behold them with the eye of Thy bounty and act in a manner befitting Thy grace. Deprive not these bare bones of Thy wondrous fresh spirit, and leave not this handful of dust bereft of Thy holy habitation. Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nAnd now, on this night, the eleventh of the month of Shawwal, thy letter was received and it so happened that it was opened in His presence and was presented. Thus did the tongue of our Purpose speak forth from the Most Exalted Horizon. These are His words, exalted be His utterance and sublime His proof:\n\nIn My Name, that speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nO Varqa! Upon thee be My remembrance, My praise, My grace, My mercy and My glory. Blessed be thy temple in that thou hast chosen for it the robe of servitude unto God, the True One. By the life of God! Thou hast chosen what God hath chosen for thee. He who recognizeth it and knoweth its station will hold fast unto it, will arise to serve the Cause, and will speak that which will draw mankind nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Thou hast spoken the truth, and We have revealed for thee that whereby all things were attracted, as a recompense for thy deeds and for thy mention of thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Verily, We answered thee before thy remembrance and after it, and at this moment when the Word of God hath shone forth from this manifest horizon. We have sent down for every name thou didst mention that which testifieth to My loving-kindness towards thee and My favor upon thee. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Give thou glad-tidings unto My loved ones from Me and remind them of that which will draw them nigh. I am the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. My mercy hath preceded My servants and My loving-kindness hath encompassed those who are in the heavens and on earth. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, at all times. He hath sent down for thee that which, were it to be cast upon the dust, it would speak; upon the bones, they would move and arise; and upon the dead, they would speak by God's leave, thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds. Thus have We sent down the table of utterance as a grace from Our presence and transmitted it unto thee. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee in all conditions and to assist thee in the victory of the Cause of this wronged, this exiled One. The servant present hath read thy letter. We testify that thou didst turn to Him in the early days and didst hear what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered, and didst behold His most exalted horizon and the creaking of His mighty and wondrous Pen, whereby the Concourse on high was attracted, as were the dwellers of Paradise who rejoiced at the mention of My momentous news, who chose for themselves a path unto Him, and who attained unto that which none before them had attained. However, most of the people are heedless.\n\nWe heard thy call. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto contentment. From thy letter wafted the blessed fragrance of pure servitude. Verily it hath been accepted, and the Wronged One hath mentioned it with a remembrance that no earthly thing can alter nor can the words of the opposers conceal. Beseech thou God that He may enable all teachers to achieve that which befitteth this day. Give thou glad-tidings to all on behalf of the Wronged One and set them ablaze with the heat of the love of God, that perchance they may attain unto that for which they were created. Praise be to God that some of the loved ones in that land and its surroundings have attained unto that which is acceptable and remembered in the presence of God. Blessed are they! The Glory shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee, upon thy children, and upon those who hearken unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nThis time events unfolded most favorably, for this servant had intended to reach the Most Exalted Horizon and Supreme Summit. The Servant of God arrived and delivered several letters to this servant. At the moment of arrival, as commanded, the letter from that beloved of hearts was immediately read and attained the honor of being heard. At that very moment, an answer descended from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all men - exalted be His bounty and great is His dominion. From the waves of the ocean of utterance, the degrees and stations of grace, favor and generosity are clear and evident. May my spirit be a sacrifice for His bounty!\n\nConcerning what was written about the honored master, His Excellency A. and H., upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, after being submitted to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, these exalted words were revealed, His exalted Word:\n\n\"O A., O H.! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all things and the Master of all beings. The error which thou didst suppose became the cause of the manifestation of bounty.\" And these exalted words were revealed from the Most Exalted Horizon specifically for that person. In every word is concealed an ocean of bounty and hidden a sun of grace. That which thou didst perform was in accordance with wisdom, and thou art commanded to act with wisdom. O A. and H.! I swear by the Sun of Utterance, there hath been ordained for thee that which the bird of imagination is powerless and incapable of attaining. Thou hast attained unto the blessing of recognition and received thy portion from the table of utterance, and thou hast been assisted to turn towards and act in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thank Him for this most great favor and say: \"Praise be to Thee for having mentioned me time and again and revealed for me that which shall not pass away, by the everlastingness of Thy name, the All-Bountiful.\"\n\nVerily, they have attained unto that which most of the people of the world are deprived and forbidden. One of their good deeds is that their sons, both before and after, attained unto that which is recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. In these blessed days the two sons, upon them be the Glory of God, together with two souls, upon them be the Glory of God, arrived at the prison and attained the honor of hearing, beholding and being present. This is a station whose greatness none save God, exalted be His glory, knoweth as it truly is.\n\nConcerning what was written about Karbila'i Zaynal, upon him be the Glory of God, after being submitted, the Luminary of Permission shone forth from the horizon of will - His is the grace and bounty, and His the remembrance and glory. In these days a new governor has arrived in this city. Although until now nothing but good has been manifested from him, verily God our Lord knoweth what is in his heart and conscience, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nHere follows the Most Great Light which illumineth the horizons - O thou who art mentioned in the presence of Him Who speaketh whilst all faces are turned towards Him! God, the Lord of all worlds, beareth witness that the Promise hath come and the Promised One hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. He hath ordained the laws, revealed the Book, and made manifest His straight path. He hath spoken before all faces and announced to all His mighty tidings. Blessed art thou for having desired that which is good in the days of thy Lord, the Lord of the exalted Throne. When the scratching of My Pen attracted thee and thou didst drink the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy knowledge and for having made me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy verses. I beseech Thee by them who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness unto Thee and have spent what they possessed for the exaltation of Thy Word and the promotion of Thy Cause, to make me detached from all else save Thee and to hold fast unto the cord of Thy loving providence. I moreover beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all being and the Supreme Ruler of the seen and unseen, to ordain for my mention an influence from Thee and a power from Thy presence that it may guide Thy servants unto Thy Most Great Path and draw them nigh unto Thy Most Perfect Order. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Supreme Ruler, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAs to what thou didst mention concerning... \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having mentioned me when I was silent in Thy remembrance, and guided me when I was heedless of Thy path, and awakened me when I was asleep. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, to ordain for this servant all the good Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Then adorn him, O my Best-Beloved, with the ornament of trustworthiness and godliness and whatsoever beseemeth Thy days, O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nThe light of the Cause is radiating from all directions, and the Fire is manifest and ablaze in the Blessed Tree, and the ocean of utterance is at its highest surge in the realm of possibility, yet the seeker is nowhere to be found. As to what has been the cause of this prevention, and what it is, the people of the realms of justice and fairness are all bewildered, for that which hath appeared hath no precedent. At every moment an ocean of verses is revealed and the river of grace and bounty floweth from the right hand of the throne, yet the people circle round stagnant waters. This evanescent servant, throughout the nights and days, clinging to the hem of the Lord of all mankind, beseecheth that perchance He may bestow the cup of meeting upon the dead, may awaken the heedless, and may guide the ignorant to the ocean of knowledge. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAs to what was written concerning the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah - upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - praise be to God, mention of him hath ever been and still is before the Most Holy Court. That beloved of the heart hath on every occasion presented mention of them before the Holy Court, and likewise Aqa 'Ali-Haydar - upon him be the Glory of God - and some of the friends of the land of Ta have made and continue to make mention of them.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the Holy Tablets, all was properly done. Praise be to God, they reached Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah Kh A - upon him be the Glory of God. The servant beseecheth his Lord to confirm him in that whereby his mention shall endure. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the family of the spiritual friend A B - upon him be 96 \\[the Glory of God\\] - after being presented before His presence, these exalted words shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance - His blessed and exalted Word: \"O Dove, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings! In consideration of outward circumstances and the general comfort of the people, their return to A B - upon him be the Glory of God - would be good, but his remaining in that land is more beloved and excellent. In any case, in these matters consultation should be undertaken; whatever becomes apparent, acting upon it will be acceptable in the sight of God.\"\n\nAnd as to what was written concerning the spiritual friends Aqa Mirza Sulayman and Aqa Mirza Mihdi - upon them both be the Glory of God - a hundred thousand thanks to the Best-Beloved of the world that He enabled them and confirmed them in their migration. They set out towards the Prison with pure intent and have been and are mentioned in the presence of God. He hath said, and His Word is the Truth: \"Verily those who have migrated in the paths of God their Lord and have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, they are of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Upon them be the mercy of God, the Lord of the worlds.\" And after being presented before the Most Holy Court, two Most Holy Tablets were specifically revealed and sent for them. God willing, they shall attain to supreme joy through the glad-tidings of this great bounty. The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nHe is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed.\n\nWe have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and sent down from the heaven of utterance the table of divine knowledge. Blessed is he who hath attained and woe unto the heedless! Today the heavenly table is being sent down at every moment and bounty from the heaven of generosity descendeth like a copious rain. Blessed are they who have attained unto this most great gift and have drunk of the sealed wine in the name of their Lord, the All-Glorious. Within this wine are concealed effects and treasured wisdoms. It sanctifieth existence from all else save God and at every moment increaseth the fire of His love. It causeth man to attain such a station that he beholdeth all else besides God as non-existent and as utter nothingness. This is of the bounty of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Ye have ever been remembered and continue to be remembered in the Most Holy Court. Preserve through His grace this most great bounty and keep it hidden from the thieves and the treacherous. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Wronged One was in a mighty fortress and a manifest prison. And this is what was revealed for the other one, blessed and exalted be His words:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh in the heaven of utterance. This is a Book sent down in truth unto people who know, and it guideth mankind unto the path of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of his Lord's utterance and hath testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from His exalted station. When thou hearest the call from the Most Sublime Horizon, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and for having sent down unto me Thy verses and caused me to hear Thy call. I beseech Thee by Thy power which the hosts and ranks have failed to weaken, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the worlds of the unseen and the seen, to make me in all conditions moved by Thy will, holding fast unto Thy cord, and acting according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord and my Support, for having remembered me time and again, for having adorned me with the ornament of Thy knowledge and enabled me to turn unto Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty and generosity to aid me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to serve Thee. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. O my God, send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who broke not Thy covenant and Thy testament, and whom the clamor of Thy creatures and the doubts of those of Thy servants who have violated Thy trust, denied Thy beauty, and rejected Thy manifestation and Thy verses, did not deter. I beseech Thee, O God of Names, to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to grant this prayer.\n\nPraised be God! In these days the emigrants have attained in every day, and the fragrance of Revelation hath been diffused at every moment. They have attained unto that which hath no likeness or parallel. Their endeavors are praiseworthy, their deeds are righteous, and their presence and visitation are accepted. That spiritual beloved one must convey these glad-tidings unto them. This word was heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, and its lofty station and exaltation are known and evident unto that one. One of the two sons who outwardly had not attained permission - the beloved of the heart, his honor Amin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - hath sent a letter to this servant requesting permission, and after it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court, it was adorned with the ornament of acceptance and permission. Blessed be their two sons and their mother, and those who have attained unto the bounty of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. The loved ones of that land are all remembered, and this servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to illumine and set ablaze all of them at every moment with the light of steadfastness and the fire of love. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and the Lord of the Last and the First.\n\nThe letter of his honor A. and H., upon him be the Glory of God and His bounty, which was in his handwriting, arrived and after it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court, this response shone forth from the Dayspring of God's Command - His words, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nHe is the Guardian over all names. O Ahmad! The One, the Single, hath made mention of thee with verses whose fragrance hath been diffused throughout the world. Blessed is he who hath found and attained. Verily he is of the people of the cities of My mercy and My loving-kindness. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and We have made thy deeds a trust from thee with God, the Powerful, the Trustworthy. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor. Verily He created thee and manifested thee and showed thee that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of His knowledge. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having mentioned me through Thy mighty verses and aided me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon, and for having sent down unto me that which hath attracted the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names. By Thy might! Whenever I turn toward the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity, I find within myself the fire of longing and yearning, and whenever I witness the heedlessness of Thy servants, bewilderment and despair seize me from every direction. I beseech Thee, O Sender of verses and Revealer of clear signs, by the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Thy Most Great Name from the horizon of the world, to assist me in all conditions to do what Thou lovest and approvest. Then send down upon me and upon Thy servants the rain of mercy and success. Verily Thou art the Cleaver of the daybreak and the Sender of the winds. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nPraise be to God! The waves of the ocean of bounty have appeared before the faces of men in such wise that none but the blind of the world would deny it. Every possessor of insight hath testified and doth testify, and every possessor of hearing uttereth and speaketh \"Thine is the grace and bounty, O Lord of the nations!\" Although the people are now heedless, yet there shall come a day when they shall remember and bewail their own selves. The servant beseecheth his Lord to purify their hearts from vain imaginings. Verily He is the Lord of mankind and the Master of days.\n\nAnd concerning the two persons mentioned in the letter, after they were specially presented, there was revealed for each that which testifieth to the mercy, kindness and bounty of God, exalted be His glory. This is what was revealed for his honor Mir Ali Asghar Askui, upon him be the Glory of God. His words, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise \\[...\\]\n\nO Mir Ali-Qabl-i-Asghar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of Destiny. All the Prophets and Messengers came specifically to guide creation to the straight path, yet the heedless servants accepted not the message of their Lord in the early days of any of them. Some they denied, and others they called sorcerers, and there befell those Gems of existence that which caused the realities of all things to lament. Though their purpose was naught but the elevation of souls, each faction clung to some vain imagination and was deprived of the light of the Sun of Truth. Praise be to the Purpose of the world Who favored thee and guided thee to the horizon of understanding. Know thou the value of this station and say: \"Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to turn toward Thee and for illumining my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and Thy Cause, through which Thou hast subdued the earth and heaven, to make me steadfast in Thy love and to enable me to drink the choice wine of immortality from the hand of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\"\n\nAnd this was revealed for Karbala'i Ahmad-i-Milani, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the One Who standeth by His Name, the Self-Subsisting!\n\nO Ahmad! Ahmad (Muhammad) the Messenger--may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake--came with the verses of the Furqan. The followers of religions denied Him and called Him a liar. Whenever the Dawning-Place of divine verses and the Source of heavenly commands appeared from the horizon of will, the people arose in denial and increased in hatred. And in those ages the might of kings and princes and the power of the divines were not as they are in these days. When the time of this Most Great Revelation arrived, it was observed that kings possessed supreme sovereignty and were firmly united, while the divines appeared with utmost power, and electrical currents moved in every direction, and fire-ships traversed land and sea. All these things outwardly appeared as instruments of harm and impediments for the friends of God, exalted be His glory. Yet this Wronged One called out before all faces without any veil or covering, and summoned all to the straight path. The instruments of the world and the veils of the nations prevented Him not. Blessed is the strong one who arose to serve the Cause, and the speaker who spoke among the people. We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to hold fast to His cord and cling to the hem of His mercy. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous, the All-Hearing, the All-Responding.\n\nPraise be to God! That which was revealed specially for these two souls beareth witness to the grace, favor and mercy of God, exalted be His glory. The cause of this enduring bounty and heavenly food was the honored and beloved Jinab-i-Alif and Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Well is it with him and pleasant it is for him. In truth, from the earliest days until now they have stood firm in service and have been engaged in remembrance. This is a great bounty and a mighty favor that they have attained unto. Another letter from that beloved of the heart, which contained the water of life, arrived. Praise be to God, its pure water was the cause of joy and gladness, and its effect was the source of delight and expansion. Praise be to the true Benefactor Who confirmed that spiritual beloved one and singled him out for His grace. And after its presentation in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed from the Mother Book. His word, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nO thou who speaketh My praise, who gazeth toward My horizon, and who standeth in service to My Cause! We have adorned thee with the ornament of Our loving-kindness and mercy, and have imparted unto thee Our Word, and have manifested thee for the promotion of Our Cause amongst Our servants. The servant who is present hath at this hour appeared, made mention of thee, and presented before Our countenance that which thou didst send. Thereupon the ocean of loving-kindness surged with the waves of mercy and bounty, and through it grace shone forth from the horizon of eternity. We have mentioned thee in such wise as hath enraptured the Concourse on High, and caused the Spirit to emerge from its Most Glorious Station in its longing to hearken unto My call, until it appeared before My face and proclaimed with the most exalted voice: O peoples of earth and heaven! This is He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities! This is He in Whose remembrance the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, were revealed! Beware, O people of the earth, lest ye deprive yourselves. Cast away what ye possess, then hasten with your hearts to the station wherein He Who is Self-Subsisting hath been established upon the Throne of Revelation and proclaimeth: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Blessed art thou for having confined thine affairs to My remembrance and praise and to the service of My Cause, the Mighty, the Beloved. Remind My loved ones on My behalf, give them the glad-tidings of My grace and mercy, and illumine them with the lights of My wondrous utterance. We have sent down for them that which calleth out with the most exalted voice and testifieth to My grace and generosity that hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen. Joy be unto him who hath attained unto the lights of My Kingdom, and woe unto every remote denier.\n\nThe enumeration of divine favors is in truth impossible. Whenever mention was made of that beloved of hearts in the Most Holy Court and gained the honor of being heard, the ocean of loving-kindness was so tempestuous and the sun of grace so resplendent that all are incapable and fall short of describing it. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God that through the education of that beloved one and the friends, people worthy of this Revelation may appear, who shall see all save God as non-existent and all names as lost before His Name. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nMention was made of the spiritual friend, his honor Huda, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Praised be God that the signs of his remembrance and praise are evident. He revealed that which testifieth to the sincerity of his intention and the purity of his nature. This is from God's grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. After mention was made of his name in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these sublime words were revealed from the heaven of grace. His mighty utterance, exalted be His proof:\n\nWe are the Manifest One, speaking in the Most Great Prison.\n\nPraise be to God that in the breath of the loved ones the effect of the water of eternal life is evident, whereby they give new life and bestow a fresh spirit upon decayed bones. O Huda! The Lord of all creation hath remembered thee before, and before that before, and at this moment. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thy remembrance hath ever been present in the Most Holy Court; thou dwellest beneath the canopies of grandeur. Though outwardly distant, blessed be thy heart for having turned, thy face for having been directed, thine ear for having heard, and thy tongue for having uttered the remembrance and praise of God among His servants. He is with thee, hearing and seeing, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to confirm thee in that wherein thou art. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee, upon those with thee, and upon all who are steadfast and firm.\n\nAnd specifically for his honor the aforementioned Khan, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, one Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the Kingdom of grace and was sent. God willing, they will drink from the divine Kawthar that is concealed within the verses and attain unto the Most Great Steadfastness, upon which all degrees of knowledge depend.\n\nThis is what was sent down from the heaven of the will of our All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord to Ismail Pasha Khan Khu'i. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the One Who watcheth over His loved ones. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the bounty and the giving, His is the power and the might in this world and the next. He ordaineth in the Most Exalted Paradise for whomsoever He willeth that which shall never end, through the eternity of His Most Beautiful Names and His Supreme Attributes. He is the Powerful One Whom the happenings of the world cannot prevent from mentioning His Most Great Name. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired before the faces of all people. He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nPraise be to God, thou hast drunk from the wine of divine love and turned toward His horizon in days when most of the people of the world were aflame with the fire of hatred and clung to the cord of rejection and heedlessness. Praise the Goal of all the worlds Who aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Source of His verses. He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nThe greatest glad-tidings is that thy letter arrived and was favored with attention and adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Thank thy Lord and say: \"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the horizon of Thy Cause, for having made me hear Thy call, for having given me to drink the Kawthar of immortality from the hand of Thy bounty, and for having shown me the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen through Thy grace and generosity. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, to ordain for me through Thy grace and mercy that which will draw me near unto Thee and benefit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, acknowledging Thy oneness and that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. There is none other God but Thee, the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word 'Be' and it is. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me through Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Kingdom and the Dominion, and the Possessor of might and power. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nConcerning what was written about the beloved of hearts, Aqa Muhammad Karam (upon him be the Glory of God and His favors), after it was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, these verses were revealed. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\n\"O Leaf! Upon thee be My glory, My favors and My mercy. Thou hast been the cause of mentioning My loved ones and My chosen ones. We beseech God to ordain for thee the reward of this deed. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The 'Ayn and Ta have attained the station of standing before the gate of grandeur and glory, and heard the Call with their ears and witnessed the horizon of Manifestation with their eyes. Give them the glad-tidings of this Most Great Remembrance and this Supreme Favor which hath encompassed earth and heaven.\" In truth, the honored 'Ayn and Ta are holding fast to that which is right and are among those souls concerning whom He saith \"and of them is he who hasteneth toward good deeds.\" We beseech God to assist him, strengthen him and make his influence enduring among the people. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nIn truth, they do not hesitate in matters of goodness, even though outwardly circumstances may not appear favorable to their will and nature. Nevertheless, they strive and endeavor to the extent possible, nay beyond that, and are swift in good deeds. Well is it with him and blessed is he.\n\nAnd concerning the mention of the beloved of hearts, His honor Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, after his name was presented at the Most Exalted Horizon, these supreme words were revealed. Thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: The Wronged One beareth witness to the arising of Haydar-'Ali to promote the Cause of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Varqa! By the life of God, divine confirmation hath seized him and heavenly support hath accompanied him. At times he is occupied with writing, and at others with the mention and praise of the Desired One. The tribulations of the world and the hatred of the nations did not prevent him from accepting and teaching the Cause. The word of contentment hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning him. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. In the word of testimony of the Wronged One lie concealed the oceans of bounty and the hidden pearls of grace. From the beginning of days until now he hath not ceased in this manifest Cause and its promotion amongst the servants. Verily We were with thee and with him, We hear and see, and We are the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and We are the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nGlory be to God! The whole world was created for the recognition of this Most Great Cause and its promotion, yet none attained thereunto save a few chosen ones who are adorned with the distinction of His special favors and are blessed with His particular bounty. It behooveth all to supplicate God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of these few chosen ones whatsoever is worthy of His generosity and bestowal.\n\nAnother letter brought supreme joy to the Supreme Scene and attained the honor of being heard. Thy supplication was presented in its entirety, and after its completion these verses were revealed from the Dayspring of the favors of the Desired One of all worlds. Thus speaketh the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing\n\nO thou who hast clung to My cord and drunk the choice wine of My utterance! The face of My mercy hath turned toward thee from the horizon of My prison, and calleth thee with that which diffuseth the fragrance of My utterance throughout My earth and My heaven, that thy remembrance may endure in My Kingdom. Verily thy Lord is the Generous, the Possessor of great bounty. We were speaking the verses of My grandeur and gazing upon the horizons of My kingdoms when the servant in attendance appeared before My face and read that wherewith thou didst commune with God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Kingdom and the dominion, the Possessor of majesty and might. We have heard thy call and the yearning of thy heart and thy lamentation and cry in separation. We beseech God that through thy call He may raise the heads of the heedless from slumber. Verily He is the most powerful of the powerful and the most merciful of the merciful. O Varqa! Upon thee be the ocean of My glory and upon thy descendants. Verily thy Lord is the Announcer, the All-Knowing. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Desired One of all worlds.\n\nIn every word lie concealed the oceans of bounty. In truth, that beloved of hearts hath attained unto the glances of the favor of the Lord of creation. A hundred thousand times blessed art thou! The servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to grant the servants success in turning unto Him, drawing nigh unto Him, and hearkening unto the verses of His grandeur. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nThou didst mention the spiritual friend, his honor 'Ayn-Qaf-Ya, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. His mention hath been and is before the Most Holy Court. Last week a special Tablet was revealed for him and sent with the Tablets for that land, and after his mention was presented at the Most Exalted Court, these sublime words were revealed specially for him from the horizon of favor. He saith, blessed and exalted be He: In My Name, the Speaker in the Prison of 'Akka \\[...\\]\n\nWe bear witness that the Eye hath drunk the wine of My loving-kindness from the chalice of My bounty, and hath heard My call when it was raised from the direction of My prison, and hath attained unto the fragrances of revelation in My days, and hath turned unto Me when most of My servants turned away. This is a testimony that hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he, then blessed is he, and the glory be upon him and upon whoever hath mentioned him in his book.\n\nO Ba! Upon thee be glory! In every instance, from all directions, while the breezes of thy mention are wafting and blowing, thy remembrance is mentioned at the court of God, exalted be His glory, and thy name exists, adorned with the ornament of My Beautiful Name. Rejoice and be of the thankful ones.\n\nThis evanescent servant is, in most times, engaged in their remembrance. Praise be to God, they are aflame with the fire of divine love and illumined with the light of His knowledge, and this is the cause and reason for the joy of the hearts and souls of the friends. Concerning what they wrote about the mention of the friends of Sisan, upon them be the glory of God, after being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these suns of utterance shone forth from the horizons of divine knowledge, utterance and wisdom. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn the Name of the Powerful Speaker!\n\nO people of Sisan! Repeatedly have ye been blessed with the revelation of the Most Exalted Pen. By the Essence that was manifested from the special treasury of the blessed word \"I was a hidden treasure,\" the world and all that is therein cannot equal one word revealed from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen. Do ye know Who speaketh and Who hath turned towards you? By the life of God! If ye truly discover and know this, ye will behold yourselves detached from the world and all who dwell therein. The immature ones of the world have attempted to mislead sanctified souls. Verily I say, these days have no peer or likeness. Know ye their value. Ye shall not attain unto the station of knowledge save through the fear of God. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, to adorn your temples with the ornament of godliness and your heads with the crown of detachment. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed are ye and your dwellings. Verily, We perceive from them the fragrance of My love, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We counsel you to perform good deeds and manifest goodly character, then We counsel you to unity and harmony, and to wisdom, wherewith We have commanded you in the Holy Books and Tablets.\n\nContention and corruption have been forbidden. All must hold fast unto that which is righteous. Today if anyone reviles a loved one of God and he showeth patience, God will ordain for him the reward of a martyr. Blessed are the patient ones, and happy are the patient ones. O friends! The life of this world is not worth mentioning. Soon shall extinction overtake it. Strive ye that perchance ye may quicken a soul with the water of divine utterance in a spirit of joy and fragrance, or sanctify a heart from the dust of idle fancies through the Kawthar of grace. The station of man is good deeds, while oppression and tyranny are the deeds of the foolish. In all conditions be ye thankful and merciful, not deniers and oppressors. Pray for those in authority, show not enmity. Were God to unveil to them what He hath unveiled to you, they would hasten with their eyes and hearts to the Most Exalted Horizon. Verily, grace is in His hands, and power unto you and unto those who have held fast to His firm cord and His mighty announcement.\n\nThe mention of his honor Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God, hath proceeded from the Tongue of Grandeur. We beseech God, exalted be He, to confirm him in His service. In the Most Holy Book hath been revealed concerning the education of children and the training of human beings that which is enduring and eternal, whose fragrance shall never fade. Verily, We glorify him from this station that he may thank his Lord, the Glorified, the All-Knowing.\n\nI supplicate and beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist His party in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word and the elevation of His Cause, and lead to the manifestation of sanctity and the emergence of detachment. Praise be to God, the companions of Milan, upon them be the glory of God and His mercy, have outstripped most lands and have drunk from the choice wine of the utterance of Him Who is the Goal of all the worlds. And the people of Sisan, upon them be the glory of God, have attained to that which most of the people of the earth are deprived of. This is through the bounty of God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths.\n\nMention hath been made of the spiritual friend, his honor Ibn-i-Dakhil, upon him be the glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Glorious. Some time ago there was revealed from the heaven of the Will of Him Who is the Goal of all the worlds, especially for him, that from whose every word the light of bounty shone forth and the Sun of Truth dawned. And now, after his name was mentioned in His presence, this utterance was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur:\n\nHis word, mighty be His proof and great His majesty: \"O Ibn-i-Dakhil! Thou art he who hath attained unto My days, and hath drunk the choice wine of My utterance, and hath beheld the horizon of My Revelation, and hath heard My call. Verily, His Holiness the Trusted One hath made thy deed a treasure for thee with Him. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Wise. Remind the people of that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My utterance, and give them the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. Say: This is the Day whereon the Herald hath called out from a near place, and the Cry hath been raised in truth from God, the Almighty, the Powerful. The earth hath been illumined with the light of its Lord, and the Mount hath attained unto Him Who converseth with it, the Mighty One. O Ibn-i-Dakhil! The people behold the signs of God yet deny them, and hear His call yet turn away from it. Say: O concourse of men! By God, the Lord of Destiny hath established Himself upon the Throne, and every hidden secret hath been revealed. Turn with illumined hearts unto His Most Great Prospect and His Most Pure Station. Beware lest the doubts of the people keep you back from the Self-Subsisting One, or the might of the wolves deter you from the Lord of the Final End. Cast the world behind you, taking the chalice of immortality in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious.\"\n\nWhen the utterance reached this most exalted station, all things cried out: \"O servants of the All-Merciful! The Balance hath been set up, the Path hath appeared, the Most Great Ocean hath surged before your faces, and the fragrance of God hath wafted among you. Thank the Lord for this bounty which hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have heard thy call and have turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nGlory be to God! For the sword of utterance there hath been and is no peer or likeness. The penetration of this sword is mightier and sharper than that of a sword of steel. Praise be to our Lord, the All-Merciful, Who hath forbidden His loved ones from oppression and tyranny, and from corruption, conflict and contention, and hath made victory to lie in utterance and naught else. It behooveth us and all the people of the world to thank Him for this great bounty. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Praise be to God! His honor hath attained unto service, teaching, attainment, reunion and the presence of God. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant him assistance and confirmation. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nThat mention was made of his honor Habib Nurani and his honor Mulla Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God and His bounty, and likewise of the luminous attraction of the wondrous Beauty - this was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold. His blessed and exalted Word: \"O Dove! O thou who gazest toward My horizon, who standest before the gate of My grandeur, and who speaketh My praise! All bounty is in the hand of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Verily He maketh the highest of His servants lowest, and the lowest highest. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\" Consider and reflect upon what hath come to pass. The sister of this Wronged One remained leagues distant from the Truth, while that handmaiden attained the honor of nearness and reunion. Yea, the banner \"there are no ties of kinship among you\" hath been raised, and the standard \"on the day when man shall flee\" hath been hoisted to the highest station in the world. This sister was not with Us and had not seen Yahya in this Cause. Out of love for the world and attachment to the possessors of glory and wealth, she passed by the Wronged One and joined the oppressor. She became associated and affiliated with the enemies in this great betrayal, and now burneth with the fire of hatred. She hath manifested such deceit that the world is astonished thereby. She hath no knowledge of this Cause whatsoever, but hath adopted countless deceptions from certain manifestations of Satan. She hath appeared in supreme wickedness and risen up to harm the Wronged One. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the new leaf and gladden her with the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth. Blessed is she and blessed is he who hath recognized her, taught her and guided her to the path of God, the Lord of earth and heaven, the Master of the hereafter and of first beginnings.\n\nThis servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to protect her and increase His love in her heart at all times. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nThat mention was made of the friends of God, upon them be the Glory of God, in that land - after their names were presented at the Most Holy Divine Threshold, there was revealed for each one that which hath testified and doth testify to the ocean of the bounty of God, our Lord and the Lord of the worlds.\n\nHe is God! O Mustafa! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings. Take thou a cup of My sealed wine, then drink thereof in My Name, the Self-Subsisting. Verily it will draw thee nigh unto thy Lord and cause thee to enter the pavilion of knowledge, wisdom and utterance. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath bestowed this great bounty and given to drink of this most pure Kawthar. When thou attainest unto it, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Ocean of bounty, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who possessest the Kingdom of Names!\"\n\nHe is God! O Ni'matullah! By the life of God! Whenever I desired to make mention of My loved ones, I heard the call of all things from every direction. This is of My bounty unto them and My loving-kindness toward them. Give thyself and My loved ones the glad tidings of that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen at this moment wherein the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: \"There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower!\"\n\nHe is God! O Muhammad-Taqi! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily it will draw thee to My horizon and give thee to drink of the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of My bounty, and will protect thee from all else besides Me and draw thee nigh unto the court of My holiness. When thou perceivest the fragrance of My loving-kindness, say: \"My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me by the light of Thy Cause to the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy testimonies. I bear witness that Thou hast appeared and manifested that which maketh the names of Thy servants to endure by the endurance of Thy names and attributes. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and within Thy grasp is the dominion of all who are in earth and heaven.\"\n\nHe is God! O Rida! The Lord of Destiny ordained for Himself imprisonment in 'Akka through the Pen of Divine Decree, and in the Most Great Prison, without veil or covering, summoned all to the Ancient Lord. Blessed art thou, for at this hour the chalice of God's remembrance hath appeared in thy name - drink thou thereof and be of the thankful ones.\n\nHe is God! O Qasim! The Sun of Truth, in this darksome night, hath turned from the horizon of 'Akka toward thee that It might remember thee. Dost thou know Who He is? He is God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Praise thy Lord and thank Him for this bounty which, were it to be pressed by the hands of love and faithfulness, would yield the Water of Life unto all creation. Hold fast unto wisdom, then guide the people into the City of the Divine Exposition, as bidden by God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nHe is God! O Fath'u'llah! The victory of God and His triumph have come, and he who was deprived in His knowledge hath now arrived. Give glad tidings unto the people and say: Open your eyes! The Luminary of proof hath dawned from the horizon of divine knowledge. Cast aside what ye possess and turn unto God, the Lord of all worlds. The world hath been stirred by the breezes of Revelation, and creation hath been seized by the rapture of His Manifestation. He speaketh from the Mount of Divine Exposition: The gate of heaven hath been opened, and its Creator hath come with a sovereignty that hath conquered all on earth. He is the Single One, the Unique, the Powerful, the Almighty. O Fath'u'llah! Thou wast created to aid the Cause of thy Lord. Hold thou fast unto it and be among the helpers. Verily, aid consisteth in teaching My Cause through utterance, not through disputation and argument. Know thou this and be among those who are endowed with knowledge.\n\nHe is God! O Ustad Ibrahim! Abraham came - they cast him into the fire. Muhammad - they called Him an impostor. Moses - they named Him a sorcerer. The Spirit (Jesus) - they declared Him an infidel. These unjust people have ever turned away from the Truth. No faces achieved acceptance save those whom thy Lord wished. By God's life! Thou wast not created for this world, but for My mighty Cause and My great Message.\n\nHe is God! O Jabbar! The Chosen One declareth: Take My Book with My power and might and say: \"O my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to make me ever turned toward Thee and detached from all else save what hath appeared from Thee. Verily, Thou art the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nHe is God! O Khalil! Thou hast attained the wine of Divine Revelation and drunk the water of everlasting life from the hand of bounty, and thou hast been mentioned time and again. We counsel thee and those who have believed to serve the Cause of God, your Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth, the Master of the hereafter and of former times. He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. He commandeth His servants to that which draweth them nigh unto Him and maketh them to be among those who fear not, neither are they grieved.\n\nHe is God! O Shirzad! How excellent is this most exalted station! The Countenance of the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the prison precinct and revealed for thee that wherefrom the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. When thou attainest unto the Euphrates of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all creation, for having illumined hearts with the light of Thy knowledge and heads with the crown of Thy favors. O Lord! I am Thy servant. I have turned toward Thee in Thy Day. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto the court of Thy holiness. Verily, Thou art the One, Thou art the Giver, Thou art the Most Generous.\"\n\nHe is God! O Muhammad-Sadiq! The Herald's purpose was to illumine the world with the lights of truthfulness and adorn the peoples with the ornament of knowledge. Yet until now no trace of it hath appeared, and the people utter such calumnies as have never been heard in all creation. They have denied God's verses, His sovereignty, His proof and His testimony. They are truly among the heedless in My manifest Book. Praise be to God that thou hast held fast to the cord of truthfulness. Today, whosoever hath attained the recognition of Truth is recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book as among the truthful ones.\n\nHe is God! O Muhammad-Ismail! God hath created thee and all who are on earth for My remembrance and praise, for the service of My Cause, for orbiting around My will and purpose, and for acting according to what hath been revealed in My Book. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that for which he was created. He is truly of the people of Baha in this most exalted station. The Tongue of Grandeur in His mighty and wondrous Kingdom beareth witness to this.\n\nHe is God! O Gabriel Bey! By the life of God, Israfil hath blown the Most Great Trump, and hearts and souls which were deprived of life in the temples of existence and forbidden the divine Kawthar of utterance have been stirred to motion and attained eternal life. Although the deniers outwardly hear, speak and move, with God they are recorded among the perished ones. Verily the Trump is the Most Exalted Pen, and We have breathed into it a command from Our presence, and I am the Ancient Commander.\n\nHe is the Helper, the All-Knowing! O Nabil, upon thee be the glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious! On this mighty and wondrous day, Ali-Muhammad hath spread a feast and invited those who circle round. At this moment, the one named Jud, upon him be My glory and favor, made mention of thee and acted on thy behalf in that which hath been the hope of those near unto God. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee. Verily bounty is in His hand and generosity in His mighty grasp. He ordaineth as He pleaseth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. We send greetings from this most mighty and most glorious station to thy children whom We mentioned before.\n\nO Muhammad-Ismail! Previously, pearls of remembrance were taken from the ocean of the favor of the Goal of all the worlds and sent to thee. Blessed art thou and blessed are His successful servants.\n\nO Ni'matullah! The true bounty and heavenly sustenance hath been and is that which was sent down from the heaven of God's will. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto it. I counsel thee to preserve what hath been granted. Verily He is the Forgiver, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nO Abdul-Ali! Make My call a wing for thyself and soar therewith in the atmosphere of My mighty and sublime love. And if thou desirest, make it a fortress for thyself to protect thee from the evil of the oppressors who have denied God's proof and testimony and turned away from the Truth, the Knower of faults. O Abdul-Ali! We send greetings from this station to thy mother's face and give her glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded existence in both the unseen and visible worlds. We beseech God to assist My male and female servants in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is the Hearer, the Mighty, the Beloved. The glory from Us be upon thee, O Nabil, and upon those with thee, be they male or female. Verily thy Lord is the Single, the One, the All-Kind, the All-Forgiving.\n\nHe is God! O Abdullah! The Cause of God is manifest and the verses of God are revealed. Hidden mysteries are evident before all faces, and the waters of mercy flow from the Pen of Him Who is the Aim of all the worlds. We beseech God not to withhold His servants from the outpourings of His days nor deprive them from the ocean of His grace. Today all things are in rapture and ecstasy at the vibration of the Most Exalted Word through the appearance of the Lord of Names. Blessed is the ear that hath been privileged to hear. You must be occupied with praise and thanksgiving to God, for the Supreme Pen hath turned toward you from the Prison of Akka. Verily, He loveth him who loveth Him and remembereth him who remembereth Him. He is the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nHe is God! O Jafar! This is a great and blessed Day. That which was hidden within man is today being and will be made manifest. Man's station is great, if he turneth unto the Truth and remaineth steadfast in the Cause. The true human being appeareth before the All-Merciful as the heaven itself - the sun and moon are his hearing and sight, and the stars are his illumined and radiant virtues. His station is the most exalted of stations and his signs educate all creation. Every soul who today hath perceived the fragrance of His garment and turned with a pure heart to the Most Sublime Horizon is recorded among the people of Baha in the Crimson Book. Take thou the chalice of My bounty in My Name, then drink therefrom through My sweet remembrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh before all faces! O Agha! Today if one who hath drunk the choice wine of inner meanings were to enter the City of Utterance, he would find all its inhabitants engaged in lamentation and weeping, for the divine sheep in every city and land are seen to be afflicted among wolves. We have seen and been patient. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient and hath commanded His servants to observe gracious patience. We have sent down for thee at this moment that which shall be immortalized in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nHe is God! O Ali! Upon thee be the Glory of God! Wonder upon wonder! From the beginning until now, not one among the divines of Iran hath become aware of His appearance and its nature. What hath been the cause of their prevention and the reason for their deprivation? With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in a mighty Book. This Wronged One hath from the beginning until now been in the hands of enemies - at times in chains, at times captive - until finally arriving at this Prison. We praise God for this and beseech Him to aid thee to be steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nHe is God! O Muhammad-Qabli-Ali! We accepted the trials of the earth for the exaltation of His blessed and supreme Word. In the days when the world was aflame with the fire of hatred, We did not hesitate in the proclamation of the Cause. We witnessed what no one hath witnessed and heard what no one hath heard. But tribulation in the path of the Lord of Names is sweeter than honey and more delicious than heavenly food. The sustenance of lovers are pieces of their own hearts, and the drink of His loved ones their flowing tears in the path of the Peerless Beloved. Blessed is the soul whom the ornaments of these fleeting days have not deprived of the abiding and eternal bounty. Be thankful unto thy Lord for having aided thee and caused thee to recognize His straight path and His mighty and firm Message.\n\nHe is God! O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! The Divine Balance proclaims with the most exalted call: The Divine Balance is the blessed word \"There is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" By this Balance all are weighed, and in less than that moment the reckoning of creation is complete. The loving ones are known by the light of their countenance, and the sinful by their marks. Glory be to God! The signs of the Resurrection and the tokens of the Hour have encompassed all, yet deeds are a mighty barrier that has prevented the servants from drawing nigh and has left them in the wilderness of remoteness. Praise be to God that you have attained to that which is the cause of prosperity and salvation. The power of princes did not prevent you, nor did the hatred of the divines deprive you. With an illumined heart you turned, and attained recognition of the Sun of Truth. Repeatedly has your mention been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks unto your Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n\nHe is God! O 'Ali M.Y.! The world is perfumed with the fragrance of the divine utterance, and with utmost joy and enthusiasm is engaged in glorification and praise. We beseech God to cause His servants to attain unto that which manifests wondrous and strange influences in the world. Through the word of acceptance, the earthly house became the point of adoration for the world, and the black stone the object of reverence for the nations. His power has manifested in every age that which is the greatest cause for faith and certitude. Blessed is he who has seen with his own eyes and heard with his own ears the call of God from the prison of 'Akka. He is indeed among the triumphant ones in this resplendent station. O 'Ali! Praise the Sovereign of existence that you are mentioned in His presence and known by Him.\n\nThe oceans of the world cannot compare with a single drop of the Kawthar of utterance of the Pre-existent Lord. It is clear and evident that the entire world was created from one drop thereof. The nobility of the oceans of the unseen and the seen has been and always will be from that drop. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nThe mentioned souls, upon them be the Glory of God, the Lord of Oneness, are blessed with eternal life, for their mention has flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and is recorded in the Book with the ink of the Most Bountiful Name. For this ink is the source of unity and the dawning-place of concord. I beseech God to assist His loved ones in preserving what He has bestowed upon them, for if the manifestations of the light of grace and bounty specifically ordained for His loved ones were to appear even to the extent of a grain, all would cry out in the wilderness of existence \"Here am I! Here am I!\" In its concealment lie hidden mysteries, and in its revelation appear bestowals. Who can reckon that to which the birds of hearts and minds cannot soar? In all things the impotence of creation is evident and the power of the Creator manifest.\n\nMention was made of Haji Mirza Fat?-'Ali ?., upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise of his certitude, steadfastness and enthusiasm. After being presented before the Lord of Names, these brilliant verses dawned from the horizon of grace in the highest heaven. His word, exalted be His glory and sublime be His utterance:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing \\[...\\]\n\nThe soul who today, in the name of Truth, has freed and detached himself from all that is with the people - he is as a pearl in the shell of the ocean of divine bounty. No description can attain to this station, for descriptions are limited by the boundaries of souls, while this station is beyond all mention and description. The highest rank and most exalted station are free from enumeration. Praise be to God! You have drunk from the choice wine of utterance in the name of the Beloved of all possibility, and this is that same choice wine that had forever been sealed and hidden from all. In this Most Great Revelation, the Finger of God's Will removed its seal and proclaimed: \"Come, advance, O people of Baha! Come, advance, O companions of My Crimson Ark! Come, advance with your hearts toward the Most Exalted Horizon, O friends of God!\"\n\nWhen you attain unto My call and the traces of My Pen, say: \"My God, my God! Separation from Thee hath set me aflame, remoteness from Thee hath seized my soul, and distance from the precincts of Thy nearness is my greatest enemy. I beseech Thee, O Thou at Whose call the near ones hastened to the place of sacrifice to offer up their souls in Thy path, and by Whose utterance in the kingdom of Thy might the hearts of the sincere ones were attracted, to make me in all conditions attracted to Thy verses, enkindled with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, moved by Thy will, and speaking that which draweth people nigh unto the court of Thy companionship. O Lord! Withhold not them that seek Thee from the ocean of Thy bounty, nor Thy lovers from the precincts of Thy nearness. Thou art He at Whose call the dwellers of the graves arose, the trumpet was sounded, and that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and preserved in the treasury of Thy protection was made manifest. I beseech Thee not to disappoint Thy servant of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Lord! Aid me to remember Thee amongst Thy servants with wisdom and utterance, and to teach Thy Cause among the religions. I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things, to manifest through me, by Thy grace and power, that whereby the standards of Thy mention and praise may be raised, and whereby that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book may be spread abroad. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant has, in truth, with utmost humility and supplication besought the Self-Sufficient One to make them the dawning-place of victory and triumph, and through His infinite bounty, the victory of His Cause has been through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and naught else. In this station, such utterances have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen as would, in an instant, transport man from earth to heaven. Glorified be the greatness of our Lord, exalted be His grace, mighty be His bounty, and magnified be His generosity, which hath encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven.\n\nAs for what they wrote concerning certain laws, by command that which hath thus far been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen and recorded is being sent. Regarding the fast for a traveler on foot, its limit hath been set at two hours. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And those souls who are engaged in arduous labor during that blessed month - this is what God, exalted be His glory, hath decreed, blessed be His bounty: Those souls are adorned with the ornament of God's pardon and favor, exalted be His glory. We have pardoned them as a bounty from Our presence and a mercy from Our side, and We are verily the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Give them the glad tidings of that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from His glorious and exalted station. However, during those days, moderation and concealment, out of respect for God's decree and the station of the Fast, is most fitting and beloved.\n\nConcerning ablutions that were asked about - whether it is possible with the ablutions performed for obligatory prayer to also recite ninety-five times the Greatest Name and visit the Shrine of the Ancient Beauty, or whether ablutions must be renewed for each one - after submission \\[to God\\], the Tongue of God spoke these words: Renewal is not necessary. In all matters His grace encompasses all and His mercy takes precedence. And He Himself suffices as witness.\n\n=== END BH00022 ===\n\n=== START BH00024 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the seekers of unity have hastened to the Dawning-Place of the lights of Thy countenance, and those who are nigh have drawn close to the Day-Spring of the signs of Thy oneness. Thou art He Who hath ever been seated upon the throne of Thy Will, ruling in Thy dominion according to that which Thy purpose hath ordained. The things of creation cannot frustrate what Thou willest, nor can the might of any in the kingdoms of creation render Thee powerless. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace to assist Thy loved ones in that which Thou hast willed in Thy days. Then protect them, O God of the world and Lord of eternity, from those who dispute Thy signs and rise up to extinguish Thy light. I implore Thee by Thy mercy which hath preceded all existence to enable Thy servants to turn unto Thee, then cause them to hear Thy call which hath been raised betwixt Thy heaven and earth. O Lord! Thou knowest and seest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures. Subdue them, O my God, through Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued the tyrants of Thy earth and the Pharaohs in Thy lands. Then send down upon Thy loved ones that which shall adorn them with the ornament of Thy favors, and exalt them to such a station that their might and power in Thy Cause shall become manifest to all who are on earth. Thou art He Who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Within Thy grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.\n\nThou knowest and seest, O my God, how my heart hath melted in the fire of love for Thy chosen ones, and how the tongue of my inner being standeth ready to praise them before Thee and to mention them in the court of Thy glory. Thou knowest, O my God, that the tribulations and adversities of the earth have not prevented me from turning toward the faces of those whom no affair can distract from Thy remembrance and praise, to such extent that after this servant had presented the reply to one of Thy loved ones, another letter from him reached me. When I read it and learned of his devotion and his arising to serve Thee, I took up the pen once again at that very moment and began writing in reply, seized neither by lassitude nor weariness. I testify that this could only have come from the wonders of Thy generosity and the manifestations of Thy grace, and from what Thou hast deposited in my heart - a fire from whose sighing can be heard the mention of Thy loved ones. Then He toward whom Thou seest my gaze directed, and for whose mention before Thee the blood boils in my veins with longing - I beseech Thee, O God of the world, by the power of Thy Most Great Name, to assist him in all conditions to serve Thee and to arise amidst Thy creation to exalt Thy Most Great Word in such wise that nothing may hinder him. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Hearing, the Near, the Generous, the Answering One.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The one true God is witness that from the fire of love for the friends of God, exalted be His glory, which is kindled within my being, I am continuously occupied with remembrance and praise, in such wise that no lassitude hath overtaken me. Most often am I engaged in verbal praise and written expression, and this bounty is naught but the result of the attention of His loved ones. For when this ephemeral one had finished mentioning all the letters of that beloved one, one after another, at that very moment when they were sent, another letter from that beloved one dated the third of Rabi'u'l-Avval passed like a morning breeze over my heart and brought awareness. In truth, the joy and delight of this ephemeral one comes at times when mention is made of God, exalted be His glory, and of the services rendered to His Cause by the sincere ones and those who are nigh. Therefore, every letter that arrives is a key to the gate of joy \\[...\\]\n\nIn His Name, the Hearer, the Beholder, the Answerer\n\nWhenever a missive arrives from them and their services to the Cause are heard, it is verily a key unlocking the door of joy and delight. I beseech and implore God that this key may ever be at hand and this breeze may perpetually waft. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAfter being apprised thereof, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Threshold. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn My Name, the Hearer, the Beholder, the Answerer\n\nRejoice, O Ali, that the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen hath been raised time and again in thy remembrance. By the life of the Beloved! Nothing that is witnessed or beheld can equal it. Verily thy Lord hath encompassed thee with His grace. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Wert thou to gather all that We have revealed for thee from My Most Glorious Station, thou wouldst behold a book of great magnitude, each letter of which is more precious in the sight of God than all things. To this testifieth every discerning knower. Be thou steadfast in My Cause, vocal in My praise, firm in holding fast to My cord, and soaring in this atmosphere wherein can be heard that which Moses heard on Sinai and the Beloved heard in His ascension. Verily thy Lord is the Explainer, the All-Wise. Thus have We caused thee to hear the warbling of the Bird of Inner Meanings from this wondrous and glorious atmosphere.\n\nO Akbar! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison, and gladdeneth thee with the glad-tidings of God's mercy and His loving-kindness, and commandeth thee that which beseemeth this Day which hath been mentioned in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers. Remind My servants of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty. By My life! Through it are attracted the hearts of the nations and are gladdened the breasts of them that have turned towards God. Say: O concourse of the earth! Be fair in your judgment concerning that which hath appeared from Him, and follow not the imaginings of such as have uttered that which was the greatest cause for the martyrdom of the Beloved of the world - He Who came with the truth and gave the glad-tidings of the appearance of the Hidden Treasure, at Whose manifestation all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nO Akbar! The scratching of the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised between earth and heaven, while the buzzing of flies is heard from behind the veil. By God's life! The people are in manifest error. Behold those who claim to be of the Bayan - they have carved with hands of falsehood an idol and taken it for themselves as lord besides God. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are today among the idolaters. Say: If ye deny what the Dawning-Place of Names hath brought, by what proof do ye uphold that which ye possess? Be fair in your judgment and be not of those through whom the fire of hatred hath been kindled in the dominion of creation. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. He concealed not Himself for less than a moment - to this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning one. He stood amongst His enemies with such steadfastness as was not shaken by the power of anyone on earth, nor was He deterred by the clamor of any mighty and powerful one. He arose amidst the world and called out with His loudest voice, summoning all to the supreme horizon. Among the people are those who have been fair, who have heard and responded, and those who have turned away and disbelieved in God Who created them by His command. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest recite them amidst those who have been so inebriated by the wine of inner meanings that they have cast the world behind their backs, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nBlessed is he whose strength hath not been weakened by the conditions of the divines, and blessed is he whose vision hath not been obscured by the veils of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment. The glory shining from the horizon of the brow be upon thee and upon those who are fair in God's Cause and hearken to the melodies of the Bird of Utterance upon the branches, and upon every one steadfast and firm. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Sadiq (upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] and His favors) being appointed to the land of Ta for the purpose of teaching, this matter was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. His exalted Word: \"O Sad! We have verily sent down verses unto thee before and have sent them to thee. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed art thou for having cast aside what the people possess and taken what thou wert commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds. Give thanks unto God for having made thee to attain imprisonment in His path and given thee to drink from the cups of tribulation in His love. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Merciful. There hath befallen thee what befell My chosen ones before thee and what befell Mine own Self time and again. To this testify all things and beyond them the Tongue of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Reflect upon the former ages and what befell the Messengers of God at the hands of the oppressors. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all who are in earth and heaven, for having made known unto me Thy Cause and given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy love and shown me Thine all-highest horizon from which the people have turned away and made me to hear the warbling of the birds of Thy throne and the melody of the Nightingale upon the branches. I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and by the table sent down from the heaven of Thy bounty, O Lord of the Throne and of the earth, that Thou write down for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of those who have taught Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance and who have associated with Thy servants in days wherein the limbs of all names trembled with fear. O Lord! Thou seest the stranger desiring the most exalted homeland in Thy presence, and the poor one turning toward the ocean of Thy riches, and the lowly one clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy glory. O Lord! Disappoint him not of what he desireth from the wonders of Thy grace and bounty, then enable him to serve Thy Cause among Thy servants. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty.\"\n\nPraise be to God that the Most Exalted Pen hath testified concerning him to that which befell him in the path of God. Can the treasures of earth equal this testimony? Can whatsoever is in the treasuries of kings compare with it? Nay, by His own true Self! All that hath been created hath come into being through one Word from non-existence into existence. Blessed is the one with vision whom the conditions of creation have not prevented from the Truth, and whom the croaking of the raven hath not held back from the cooing of the Dove of the Cause. This is a Day the like of which hath not been seen. The steadfast souls who are firm and upright, who have drunk from the ocean of steadfastness and who are gazing toward the Dayspring of verses, must exert their utmost endeavor in teaching the Cause of God. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Exalted True One to assist His loved ones in that which is the cause and means of the remembrance of His servants. God willing, may they offer the wine of immortality in the name of the Lord of Names to the people of the Kingdom, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the ocean of the All-Merciful's mercy and be not heedless of that which is intended. This servant conveyeth his greetings and salutations to him and seeketh divine confirmation in all conditions.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about Aqa 'Abdu'l-Karim and his association with one of the imaginary persons, this explanation was submitted, and He said: \"O 'Abdu'l-Karim! Reflect upon the cause and reason for all the tribulations and afflictions that befell the Primal Point and the friends of truth. By the life of God! If one were to reflect, he would soar on wings of detachment in this subtle and gentle atmosphere. The cause and reason were the fabricated words of imaginary persons. A person who did not exist - they fashioned a form through their vain imaginings, assigned him a locality, and gave him residence in cities of fancy. These vain imaginings caused that Essence of being to be martyred by bullets of hatred. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people!\n\n\"Reflect upon the Shi'ih sect. For nearly thirteen hundred years they counted themselves the most exalted, most God-fearing, most excellent and most learned among all peoples. Yet when the divine test came, they pronounced their verdict against the Sovereign of existence for Whose appearance they had been lamenting night and day, and they shed His most pure blood. Thus it became clear that the Shi'ih sect was lower and more ignorant than all other sects in the world, save for a few souls who attained to this station through other means.\n\n\"God is My witness that the people who have arisen today in complete opposition to this Wronged One have never had, nor do they now have, any knowledge of the essence of the Cause. They fabricate lies against God yet perceive it not, they say that which they know not, and they imagine themselves to be guided. Nay, by the Self of God, the Self-Subsisting! Now the worms of the earth are following the example of previous imaginary persons and are occupied in contriving the same vain imaginings. God protect us and thee from their evil and their scheming.\n\n\"God willing, thou wilt arise to promote the Cause of God in such wise that no one on earth will find occasion to oppose or object. Behold with thine eye His most exalted horizon, then hearken with thine ear to His most sweet call. This is what thou hast been bidden by God, the Lord of all beings and the Master of the Last and the First.\n\n\"Pray for the opposers and the veiled ones. Beseech the peerless God to guide all to the straight path and deny none His supreme bounty. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth greetings to him and submitteth that one is astounded by these ignorant masses. This servant, as all the people of the Bayan can testify, spent twelve years, by the command of the Ancient Beauty, with that imaginary person. Not one of the opposers ever questioned this servant so that details could be given and they could become informed. Now it is observed that souls who have never seen and who are utterly unaware of God's Cause, both past and present, have arisen and are occupied with leading pure souls astray. They have newly determined to organize another Shi'ih sect. Then afterward, who will they condemn to death and whose blood will they declare lawful to shed? Sighs ascend and tears descend for what hath come to pass and what will come to pass against God's chosen ones and His loved ones at the hands of these people. How many truthful souls did they condemn to death and arise to martyr! They shed the blood of anyone who drank from the ocean of knowledge and declared that the Promised One would appear from physical lineage \\[...\\]\n\nAnd He said that the Promised One would appear from among the descendants, yet they shed His blood and plundered His possessions. And all this oppression came from those whom the Shi'ites have regarded and continue to regard as their leaders after the Imams, and whose obedience they consider essential to their religion. Away with them and with those who follow them without any clear proof or enlightening Book! Even more veiled, more erring, more rebellious, more astray, and more remote than these people were and are those who turned away from the Bayan. In truth, your honor has spoken an eloquent word in mentioning that no community has ever been witnessed to be so negligent and unjust. This evanescent servant beseeches the Truth to confirm your honor and to make you manifest with such ardor that the hearts of the friends may be set ablaze with the warmth of love for Him, and the hearts of the enemies may melt. Verily, He is the Helper in the hereafter and in this world. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most High.\n\nO beloved of my heart! At one time in these stations, a divine utterance was revealed from the True One, glorified be His majesty, and was written and sent to the beloved son of the Most Truthful One of God, upon them both be all the most glorious glory. Surely a copy of it will reach you and you will observe it. Such sublime utterances that have been revealed from the Supreme Pen are most beneficial, for souls are still veiled and deprived by the vain imaginings of the past from the subsequent Luminary. For instance, one of the friends of God from the land of Kha wrote to one of those residing in the desired land, mentioning that a certain Siyyid, who was among the renowned people of piety, after the proof was completed for him, said: \"This person of whom you speak - even if he should turn heaven into earth and give life to decayed bones, we would not believe, for his parents are known.\" Now observe how the vain imaginings of the past have prevented souls from ascending to the highest heights and have deprived them of the Euphrates of divine mercy. The very statement they made before, that the Qa'im resides in Jabulqa and Jabulsa, became the cause and reason for the shedding of pure blood, as all have witnessed. Now too the veiled ones of the Bayan are occupied with the same utterances and have been and are striving day and night to build the region. Woe unto them and unto whoever turns to them, hearkens to their words, and clings to what they possess! Glory be to God! The divine verses are flowing and descending like torrential rain by night and day, to such extent that they have encompassed all horizons. Surely by now many times the equivalent of the Bayan has been revealed. Nevertheless, the unjust leader has written to his followers that \"they take two words from the Qur'an and two words from the Bayan, compose verses, and send them to different regions\" - and the heedless, deluded souls have accepted these ravings. Say: O people, where has fairness gone? What has become of understanding? For God's sake, reflect for a moment on the wondrous, sublime verses, that perchance the hidden mysteries may be unveiled and you may behold the horizon of the proof of the All-Merciful with His eye. In no way have the verses of this Most Great Revelation been similar to previous verses, nor are they now. This lowly one submits to those souls: Is there no possibility that you might be in error? Is it not possible? Reflect with fairness somewhat on past events and judge for yourselves with insight. For thirteen hundred years all your divines, with the utmost effort and endeavor, through what they deemed to be conclusive proofs, arguments, solid evidence, and successive traditions, established that the Qa'im exists on earth and dwells in Jabulqa and Jabulsa. And any knowledgeable divine who denied these ravings and said that the Promised One would be born from physical loins, they counted among the infidels and issued a decree for his death. Thus they killed all by the decree of those wrongdoing souls who considered themselves the leaders of mankind. All these matters are clear and evident. Until after one thousand two hundred and sixty years that Essence of being appeared in Shiraz in a known place from the womb of His mother, and it became clear and evident that all the divines \\[...\\]\n\nIt became clear and evident that all the divines and their followers had been in error for one thousand two hundred and sixty years, and not a single one of these souls had become aware of the truth. And if any soul did become aware, he dared not reveal it, for at such time the cry of \"O for the Law!\" and \"O for the Faith!\" would be raised, as indeed it was raised. In such circumstances, one must not remain heedless but must view all matters with the eye of justice. After it was established that a vast multitude in many generations were all heedless, erring, and rebellious, it is possible these few souls may also be in error. This servant submits this with humility, for his Lord loved and loves humility. Otherwise, by Him Who caused the Tongue of Dawn to speak His praise and glory, they have indeed denied God and turned away from Him Whose Covenant was taken from all the Prophets of the past and those who came after them - the Point of the Bayan, Who came from the presence of the All-Merciful and gave the glad-tidings to all of this Revelation, through which, when it appeared, the ocean of divine knowledge surged and the fragrance of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, was diffused. O Beloved of my heart! Where is fairness, where is vision, where is hearing? In truth, what has happened that these people have so quickly turned away from that Intended One concerning Whom the Point of the Bayan hath said: \"He cannot be indicated by any indication, nor by what is mentioned in the Bayan. The Cause is in the hand of God, our Lord and the Lord of all religions.\" Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou hearest the sighing of my heart in this station, the cry of my inner being, and the lamentation of my heart. Thou art He Who gave glad-tidings unto all of Thy manifestation, Thy appearance, and Thy seat upon the throne of Thy grandeur, and made the entire Bayan as but a leaf from its Paradise, and took its Covenant from those who claimed belief in Thy Self. Yet when the horizon of manifestation was illumined and He Who conversed on Sinai came, they arose in opposition and objected to Him in such wise that the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the inhabitants of the cities of names bewailed their tyranny. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Mother Book which none save Thyself hath comprehended and which none save Thy knowledge hath encompassed, to aid those who have been heedless of meditation upon Thy verses and of turning to Thy clear proofs. O Lord! Thou seest them in the ignorance of the Days of Ignorance and in the breaking of Thy Covenant. O Lord of all creation! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy power and the heaven of Thy grace to make known to them what Thou hast intended through Thy Will and what Thou hast decreed through Thy Purpose. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.\n\nI swear by the Sun of the horizon of truth that whatsoever this evanescent servant hath mentioned was solely for God's sake. Every fair-minded soul can detect from it the fragrance of truthfulness. He had and hath no purpose save the deliverance of those heedless souls who are drowning in the sea of vain imaginings. Were they to reflect even slightly on what hath been mentioned, all would be struck with such wonder that they would find themselves powerless to describe it. O people of the world! Hearken unto the plaintive cry of this evanescent servant, and turn from the left hand of idle fancies to the right hand of certitude. It would be a pity if in such days as these, wherein all have awaited His presence, ye should be debarred and deprived of Him. Behold with your own eyes the Most Great Scene, and with attentive ears hearken unto the divine verses. That which hath been manifested of verses, clear proofs, testimonies and evidences throughout successive years defieth enumeration by man. Reflect upon the first year of the Revelation until it reached the Point of the Bayan, and upon the proofs, testimonies and evidence that have been presented before diverse parties and scattered peoples from beginning to end. Today each soul must imagine himself standing in the divine presence, positioned before the Lord of the seen and unseen, that he may speak and hear with true sincerity. Assuredly at that moment he will find his way to the highest horizon and attain recognition of the Most Great Luminary. Any fair-minded person will, in less than a moment, attain unto the living waters of utterance. Two wings are needed: one is fairness and the other is seeking. With these two one can soar to the highest horizon and wing one's flight in that atmosphere wherein \"God was, and there was nothing else besides Him.\"\n\nThis mortal's heart is aflame seeing how the trees of being have been stripped of leaves and fruits through the tyranny of the ignorant ones of the earth who are known as learned. Now that but a few leaves and fruits remain, burn them not with poisonous winds. Waste not what ye have experienced of tribulations and afflictions in the path of the Beloved, but preserve them in the name of God, exalted be His glory. Both the Beloved and this mortal must, with utmost humility and supplication, beseech from God, glorified be His majesty, confirmation for the ignorant ones who are unconscious from the wine of heedlessness, that perchance through the divine fragrances they may rise from the graves of self and passion and turn toward the highest horizon. However, alas, alas, such deeds and words have issued from those souls as to entirely prevent this blessing. God willing, that beloved one will arise with perfect power and might to promote the divine Cause and speak that which is as spirit to the seekers and as fire to the deniers and rejectors. Through God's grace, for years that beloved one hath attained unto this most exalted, most glorious station. Blessed are ye and happy are ye. Glory be upon your eminence and upon whoever hath heard your mention and utterance concerning this Cause whereby hath been manifested what God intended from before and after. Blessed is he who hath heard and turned, and woe unto the heedless and the hostile.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Mulla Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], that praise be to God he hath turned toward the horizon of the Cause and hath drunk from the incomparable living waters - this was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was sent down from the Kingdom of might and power. His exalted Word \\[...\\]\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Hearken unto the voice of the True One, the Trustworthy, Who hath appeared for the reformation of the world and the education of its peoples, and Who hath borne all manner of tribulations and calamities that perchance the people of the earth might attain unto the imperishable fountain and find their way to the most exalted horizon. The Truth, exalted be His glory, hath appeared with proof and evidence before all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and yet most of the people on earth remain deprived and bereft of beholding the lights of the dawn of inner meanings, veiled by the coverings of idle fancies. Say: O people of the world! The Most Great Luminary hath risen and shineth forth, and declareth: Whatsoever proofs, testimonies and evidences ye hold in your hands, whereby ye seek to validate your diverse religions, all these must ye seek from the Dayspring of the Divine Command, the Source of Revelation, and the Manifestation of God's Own Self. Should ye attain unto this, ye would not soil the hem of the near ones with the dust of vain imaginings, and would transform oppression into justice. Every atom beareth witness that until now there hath been revealed that which the eye of the world hath never seen the like thereof. Say: Fear ye God, and follow not your idle fancies. Follow ye Him Who speaketh amongst you that He may draw you nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, may ye at all times hold fast unto the cord of His bounty and cling to the hem of His mercy. Glory be unto him who hath turned unto Him and attained, and woe betide them that have turned away. This servant conveyeth greetings to him and beseecheth the Exalted Truth to make him steadfast with supreme steadfastness. He is indeed near and responsive. Concerning what was mentioned about blind imitation and the vain imaginings of the generality of the world's peoples, it is hoped that the Hand of Divine Power may rend asunder all veils. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. And that beloved one is, praise be to God, assisted in rending asunder the veils and is confirmed through wisdom and utterance.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about my brother Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, this servant submits that they should agree to what the Divine Tongue has previously uttered. Let them take from this servant several proofs equal to those held by the various parties on earth, and turn to the Supreme Horizon. If one holds fast to the cord of justice, one will not remain veiled from any matter. Today the followers of the Qur'an cling to the Qur'an which was sent down from God, using it to prove their truth. And yet there exist several times as many revealed Books now present and at hand. The Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, was from among the Arabs and appeared among the Arabs, while now the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Manifestation of the Unseen is from Persia and has appeared in Persia. Arabic and Persian verses have been revealed to such a degree that scribes are powerless to reckon them. Moreover, let them observe and reflect upon the evidences. That which has appeared in this Most Great Revelation has appeared in no other age, and He has clearly foretold future events beforehand. All fair-minded ones bear witness to what has been mentioned. If they would reflect upon the conclusive proof, the conquering power and the penetrating might of God, it would suffice them all and they would utter the words \"I believe in Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world!\" God willing, may all attain to this station which is more evident than the sun and not deprive themselves of God's eternal bounty. When the Most Great Luminary dawned from the horizon of the Land of Mystery, one of the people of Qaf expressed bewilderment and hesitated concerning the truth of this Most Holy, Most Exalted Cause. A Tablet was revealed from the heaven of God's Will - O what a Tablet! In each letter of it surged the ocean of utterance and wafted the fragrance of the All-Merciful. The end of that Tablet flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in these words, exalted be His glory: \"And if thou fearest for thy faith, take this Tablet and preserve it in the pocket of thy trust, and when thou enterest the place of gathering and God asks thee by what proof thou hast believed in this Revelation, then bring forth the Tablet and say: 'By this Book, the revealed, the blessed, the ancient.' Then read what hath been revealed therein before the face of thy Lord, the Resting-Place wherein thou beholdest the Prophets and Messengers. Then will all stretch forth their hands toward thee and take the Tablet and place it upon their eyes out of their longing to meet Me and their ardent love for Me, and they will find from it My hallowed, mighty fragrance.\" If all on earth would attain to fairness even less than the eye of a needle and reflect upon what hath been revealed from God's Kingdom, all would utter the words \"Would that I had not taken so and so as a friend!\" Glory be to God! With these manifest evidences, revealed verses, radiant conditions and dawning manifestations, how can one remain veiled and be observed as heedless? On one occasion this exalted word was revealed from the Tongue of the Dayspring of Names: \"The example of previous peoples who are now deprived of the splendors of the Sun of Truth is like one who clings to a drop and objects to the ocean.\" In truth, the followers of religions are most heedless. They must either completely deny the Truth or hold fast to this Most Great Revelation. There is no other choice, there has been none and there will be none.\n\nPraised be God for that which hath appeared and brought forth what He intended through His command \"Be!\" and it is. O My loved ones in that land! A letter from one who loveth God hath arrived wherein mention was made of you. We have remembered you with a remembrance whereby the dead have risen. Blessed are ye for having attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Ye are they who have quaffed the wine of inner meaning from the hands of the bounty of your Lord, the Lord of the Final End. Know ye your stations, then preserve them through this Name at Whose appearance the Sacred Books have bowed down and the servants were thunderstruck. Beware lest the whisperings of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of Lords, prevent you. Leave them to themselves, turning with illumined hearts to the Supreme Horizon. Thus doth the Mother Book command you. Say: O people of the earth! Come ye and observe justice concerning that which hath appeared from the horizon of God's Will. Fear God and follow not every oppressive deceiver. By God! The ocean of inner meanings hath surged before the countenance of the All-Merciful, the path of justice hath been raised up, and from the right hand of the Throne hath flowed the Euphrates of thy Lord's mercy, the Sovereign of all horizons. Say: Leave ye the pond behind you and turn ye to the Most Great Ocean, as bidden by God, the Lord of all men. Verily We have appeared and summoned all to the Hidden Mystery Which hath come from the heaven of Command with the banners of verses. We sent unto the King of Paris that whereby the fragrance of God was diffused throughout all possibility. He received it but answered not his Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. Whereupon We revealed unto him another Tablet wherein We mentioned what befell him. The servants who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn bear witness to this. We counsel you to manifest supreme steadfastness and give you glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for you in the Kingdom by God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Glory be upon you and upon those who love you and make mention of you through that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen by God, the Lord of all men.\n\nPraise be to God! The loved ones of Truth have ever been and shall ever be the recipients of His favors. God willing, may they recognize the value of this bounty and exert their utmost to preserve it. The mention of the emigrants in the Land of Sad hath ever been and shall continue to be made in the Most Holy Presence and Most Great Scene. God willing, may they remain firm on the straight path and drink at all times from the Kawthar of bounty. All those who are related to that beloved one are illumined by the rays of the Sun of favor. This servant beseecheth his Lord to aid them in that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to grant them success in teaching His Most Holy, Mighty and Wondrous Cause. The conveyance of greetings and sincere regard from this servant to them and all the gentlemen and friends is dependent upon your grace.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Ibn Jinab Rida-Quli Khan, upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], this servant was greatly pleased, for he was very saddened by his lack of recognition. We beseech God that He may assist him to recognize His sacred Being and decree for him that which contains the good of this world and the next. These details were presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. His words, exalted be His grandeur: \"O 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar and O thou who gazest upon God, the Lord of Destiny! The Wronged One makes mention of thee from the prison-ward, and mentions him whom thou didst mention, as a token of His grace. He is verily the All-Knowing Rememberer. Make mention of him on My behalf and give him the glad tidings of his Lord's loving-kindness, the Almighty.\" God willing, may they remain steadfast and firm in the Cause with utmost joy and delight, and conduct themselves with wisdom. The grace of God, exalted be His grandeur, encompasses all. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. All must hold fast to some means, and this binding decree hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in various tablets. He hath verily revealed that which benefiteth His loved ones. He is the Guardian of those who have turned unto Him and the Helper of those who act.\n\nAs for the mention made of the late and forgiven Jinab-i-Dhabih, upon him be Baha'u'llah, mention of him has previously been made in detail by the Supreme Pen. God willing, that beloved one will attain to its perusal. Likewise, mention has been made of his relatives. We beseech God and hope that He will cause each one to attain unto that which hath been specifically revealed for him. The Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed in the name of Jinab Aqa Mirza Ghulam-'Ali, upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], and in that blessed Tablet mention was made of the late and elevated one, upon him be Baha'u'llah and His grace, by the Pen of Bounty. There hath been revealed for him that whose fragrance shall never be cut off from the worlds. Likewise, the Most Great Favor hath embraced his nephew, for since his father is deprived of the Kawthar of recognition and barred from the supreme horizon, therefore in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet his relationship to the martyred one of the land of K, upon him be Baha'u'llah, was recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Tablets, for when mention of him was made at one time in the Most Holy Presence, He said: \"O servant who art present! He is the son of him who was martyred in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have attributed him to that one as a token of Our grace, that he may be of the thankful.\" This is a bounty for which, were they to render thanks throughout their lives, it would still be little, and this blessed passage hath been revealed time and again. Blessed is he, and upon him be glory.\n\nThe petition of Jinab Haji Mirza Hasan-i-Harati, upon him be Baha'u'llah, which was included within thy letter, was presented before the Presence of the Goal of the worlds. This is what the Desired One hath spoken in reply:\n\nIn His Name, the Mighty, the Great \\[...\\]\n\nO Hasan! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison, and hath heard thy call and thy lamentation, and recognized what thou didst desire in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. He hath come with the truth to give life to all who are on earth and to manifest that which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of the Messengers. He hath appeared to reveal the decree of the Meeting which God's Messengers had formerly heralded, and beyond them that which the All-Merciful had sent down in the Qur'an. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou for having turned to Him, and heard, and communed with thy Lord among the myriads who have turned unto Him. Give thanks to God for this most great favor, which cannot be equaled by whatsoever the people possess. To this testifieth He Who speaketh in this station that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Kawthar of reunion hath flowed before the face of thy Most Exalted Lord, but the people have come between thee and Him - they are assuredly among the oppressors. Grieve not over anything, be content and thankful for what hath been ordained for thee from the presence of One Who is Mighty, All-Informed. We have remembered thee and the handmaiden who hath believed in her Lord on a day when the handmaidens of the earth turned away from Him, save those whom God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, pleased to exempt. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have heard and responded on this wondrous Day.\n\nThe details of this land were written in the previous letter. Two packets were sent, one in the name of that beloved one and another packet in the name of my beloved, His Holiness Ibn-i-Ismu'llah-i-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God. God willing, the honored Haji Mirza Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God and His might, will deliver them. Today, beseech God to assist His loved ones in teaching and in preparing the means thereof. In one of the Tablets, this exalted word was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen that if someone is not able to teach, they should appoint a deputy. God willing, may the people be assisted in paying the Rights of God. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey greetings and praise to the aforementioned Haji. This servant beseecheth the Exalted Truth that either this request be honored with permission or that the reward of attaining His presence be recorded for him by the Most Exalted Pen.\n\nAs for the mention of His Holiness Ibn-i-'A?, upon him be the Glory of God, his letter arrived and was the cause of joy. Praise be to God, they are remembered in the holy presence and God willing, they are engaged in mentioning the Desired One of all worlds with the utmost joy and fragrance. Mention of them was made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed in the Book from God, the Mighty, the Bestower. His word, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nIn My Name, the Compassionate, the Bountiful \\[...\\]\n\nO Kind One! Thy servant hath appeared with thy letter and presented it before the face of the Wronged One. We have heard what was contained therein and have answered thee out of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou and thy father who hath ascended unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. We have made mention of thee before and before that, that thou mayest remember thy Lord, the Possessor of all being. He before Whom the Kingdom of the Bayan hath bowed down hath been opposed by one who knoweth not his right hand from his left. Thus doth the Truth, the Knower of the unseen, recount unto thee. Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair in the name of God and follow not the desires of those who were behind the veil and who, when We revealed the Cause, came forth and uttered that which even the idolaters had not said. Say: By God! What ye possess will not profit you, nor will he whom ye have taken as lord besides God benefit you. Fear ye the All-Merciful, then speak forth with pure truth concerning this Cause whereby the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings were rent asunder. We make mention of thy brother who hath attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God. He came, was present, saw and heard. Verily thy Lord is He Who judgeth as He pleaseth by His word \"Be\" and it is. We make mention of thy other brother to whom the Supreme Pen hath testified that he attained the presence when he turned toward the lights of the Countenance in a praiseworthy station. We make mention of thy mother who believed in God when the servants who broke the Covenant turned away and followed every ignorant deluded one. Thus have We mentioned thee and shown thee the pearls of utterance from this surging sea. We make mention of the daughter of My Most Truthful Name who sacrificed his spirit in My path and cast aside the world in his love for Me. We make mention of thy son who was remembered in the presence of the Prisoner, and We make mention of My handmaidens near thee who have turned, heard and believed in God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Beloved. The glory be upon thee and upon those with thee from God, the Possessor of existence.\n\nThis servant giveth glad tidings unto all of the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and His all-embracing bounty and His preceding mercy. God willing, may all the members of that household drink from the chalice of steadfastness and preserve their stations through the name of the One True Friend, for great and mighty indeed is the station of steadfast souls, especially those who have been the target of trials and tribulations in the path of divine love. O friends! Know ye your station and recognize your worth. How many souls waited day and night, and with utmost humility and supplication sought to attain the Divine Day, yet all were observed to be deprived at the time of its manifestation. Blessed are ye for having shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the power of certitude. The Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said that a year-old drop of the Day of His Manifestation is mightier than all the Bayan. Well is it with you and pleasant is it unto you. It is hoped that the perverted words of deluded souls will be found to be non-existent in the court of the friends of God, exalted be His glory. The Command is in God's hands, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nConcerning what was written about Jinab-i-Sulayman Khan, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, God willing may he be assisted to pay his debts. And concerning what was written about the late and elevated Aqa Fath'u'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory and mercy, and what remained of him, it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. His exalted Word: \"Verily We have sent down the Book and commanded all to observe what is goodly and that which exalteth the station of man. Exalted is the Most Merciful Who hath appeared and revealed what He desired. We have detailed therein the details of all things and counseled all in what will profit them in this world and the next. He is verily the Mighty, the Bestower. Hold fast to the Book of God, then follow what hath been revealed therein from My Most Exalted Pen which speaketh: 'There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Chosen.' We make mention of him who was named Fath'u'llah, who ascended to the Supreme Horizon, the station which God hath sanctified beyond mention and description. We testify for him to that which shall be a light before his face in all the worlds of God. Thus did the grace of his Lord, the Most Merciful, encompass him. He is among those who attained the love of God in such wise that We found his fragrance, and this is of My bounty which hath preceded all created things.\"\n\nIn the Book of God the law of inheritance hath been revealed and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen, but in this instance They said that whatever portion of those funds that may be given to the teachers of the Cause is most beloved, for the work of teaching is regarded before God as among the most great matters. Blessed is he who attaineth unto it.\n\nConcerning what was written about the inheritance of the brothers and sister of the late and forgiven Haji, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, whatever was done according to Islamic law before the Kitab-i-Aqdas is and was acceptable before the Most Merciful. And concerning what was written about the emigrant daughter, upon her be the glory of God, it is known that they have not and will not fall short in whatever they can do. Today all must be mindful of one another, for all are as the fingers of one hand. He saith, exalted be His Word: \"Ye are all the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.\"\n\nHowever, distinction is achieved and stations become clear and evident through the manifestation of love, arising to serve, working for the sake of God, and turning toward His path. This servant implores and beseeches God that your honor may ever be assisted to serve the Cause and to show love toward the friends of God.\n\nThis servant, at the time of attendance and presenting matters, mentioned the honored friend Aqa Muhammad K.R., upon him be the glory of God, and whatever had been written to this evanescent one was presented, and the answer was revealed in response to the matters in that beloved one's letter. Therefore this servant was not content to cause additional trouble and did not submit a separate letter to his service. I hope to be pardoned. And what that beloved one had written concerning the emigrant daughter was presented before His countenance. He said: \"It behooveth him to be vigilant in the days of God and steadfast in what hath been commanded from the presence of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nAs regards what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Muhammad, it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Threshold. By the life of the Beloved! The Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken that which hath caused the hardest rock to melt and the desert sands to flow. This servant is not, nor ever shall be, capable of conveying all that he heard. I testify by God, and He sufficeth as witness, that even those below this servant are incapable. This is a time for lamentation and weeping, a season for crying out and wailing, for one who was unable to speak hath been seized by the Lord, and remained heedless and veiled from the Almighty Sovereign Who, in days when the world's horizon trembled from the might of that Day, summoned all who dwell on earth, both kings and subjects. This evanescent one is bewildered as to what to say. Now let us pass beyond all this and turn to the holy Writings, that perchance they may discover the effulgent lights of inner meanings in the words of the Revealer of verses, and thereby be illumined. Some time ago, in one of the Tablets, these exalted words were revealed from the Supreme Pen - exalted be His glory: Fix thy gaze upon these blessed words which, like unto the sun, have shone forth from the heaven of God's holy Tablet: \"Return ye to the holy Writings, O ye who are endowed with insight!\" Through the heedlessness of all on earth, the Cause hath reached such a pass that the Sun of Truth must needs adduce proofs for Its own effulgent rays.\n\nO my God and the God of all created things! O my Sovereign and the Sovereign of all existence! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the breezes of the gardens of Thy utterance were wafted forth in Thy days, and by the Word whereby the resurrection was established amongst Thy creation, to aid Thy servants to be fair in Thy Cause and to turn unto Thy horizon. O Lord! Disappoint them not of the ocean of Thy bounty, and debar them not from the gate of Thy grace. Thou dost witness and behold, O Thou Beloved of the world, that hearts have melted by reason of what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures and the transgressors amongst Thy people. Ordain, therefore, for Thy weak servants that which shall make them mighty in Thy dominion, that they may acknowledge that which the Tongue of Thy Revelation hath acknowledged. Thou art, verily, the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nIn brief, the details concerning the Shaykh and all that he mentioned were presented before His countenance. This is what the Tongue hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His saying:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient, the Most Holy, the Most Great\n\nO Muhammad! This is the Great Day and Great Cause, which in all the divine books and heavenly scriptures is known as the Day of God. Though all days are related to the Truth, this Day has been specially designated by the Most Exalted Pen, both in times past and future. The Greatest Vision has appeared, yet sight is rare; the Call is raised from the prison, yet attentive ears are scarce. The signs of Truth are manifest like His very existence, clear and evident, yet the vain imaginings of heedless souls have prevented people from beholding the lights of certitude.\n\nHearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One and arise as befitteth this Day. God willing, thou mayest, through the choice wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful, quicken them that lie dead in the valley of self and desire. Stand for God's sake and speak for God's sake; perchance the thick veils may be rent asunder and eyes may be blessed with beholding the lights. The ocean is distinguished from the pond. Say: This is the Day wherein the Balance proclaimeth \"I am the All-Knowing Distinguisher.\" Fear God and follow not your desires. Turn with illumined hearts toward the dawning-place of your Lord's bounty, the Lord of all beings, and follow not the imaginings of the wayward. This is the Day which God's Books have foretold aforetime, and of which the All-Merciful hath given tidings - the Day whereon all people shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\n\nSay: O people of the earth! The Promise hath appeared and the Promised One is come. The Kingdom is God's, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which God, the Lord of all worlds, hath bidden you. How many learned ones have turned away from the All-Knowing, and how many ignorant ones have heard, hastened, and said: \"Here am I, O Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\"\n\nFix thy gaze upon the Supreme Horizon, and speak in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. Hold fast unto the Most Great Handle that speaketh in the world and calleth all to the Most Great Name, giving them glad tidings of the Euphrates of the mercy of their Lord, the Gracious. Hearken thou unto the call of the Wronged One and arise in His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Take thou His sealed wine and drink thereof once in My name and again in remembrance of Me, in defiance of them that have disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great.\n\nEmerge from the horizon of silence, speaking forth this Name at Whose appearance earthquakes have occurred, tribes have lamented, and smoke hath enveloped the dwellers of the heavens and the earth, save them whom the hand of thy Lord's power hath protected, the Almighty, the Powerful. Call out with the most exalted call: \"O peoples of creation! Is there any among you who can perceive the sweetness of the All-Merciful's utterance? Is there any among you with vision to behold what hath shone forth from the horizon of proof? Is there any with hearing to hear the Call of God, the Mighty, the Peerless?\"\n\nSay: O people of the Furqan! The Lord hath come upon the clouds of utterance and the All-Merciful hath given you glad tidings. Be fair in God's sight and be not of the abased. The Path calleth you unto truth and the Balance proclaimeth: \"Thine be the praise, O Thou Who art the Desire of the worlds!\" Then turn thy face toward the people of the Spirit and say: By God! That which ye were promised in the Gospel from God, the Mighty, the Beauteous, hath appeared. He hath come with such sovereignty as none in the heavens and earth can withstand. Jerusalem hath been illumined with the lights of His countenance, while ye remain heedless. If ye desire the Manifestation, lo, He hath appeared in truth, and if ye seek signs, the horizons are filled with them. Beware lest what ye possess prevent you from this momentous Cause.\n\nSay: O people of the Torah! The Revealer of verses hath come, and Zion crieth out: \"The Hidden Name hath appeared!\" Hasten \\[...\\]\n\nAnd Zion crieth out: \"The Hidden Name hath appeared! Hasten ye, and be not of the heedless. This is a Day whereon all things cry out, and call all to the Most Great Ocean; yet the nations have waxed proud before God, save those who have come with a lowly heart.\" Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged, and the fragrance of thy Lord's garment, the All-Merciful, been wafted abroad. Be thou thankful, and numbered with them that remember. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nGod willing, may his honor Shaykh be confirmed in arising and calling out in such wise that the buzzing of flies shall not prevent him from hearing the melodies of the Nightingale of eternity. This servant conveys greetings and salutations to him, and declares: I swear by the Sun of Truth that those souls who are turning away today have been and are heedless, having never truly understood this Cause. Glory be to God! To such a degree have vain imaginings encompassed those souls that they remain entirely deprived and veiled from the rays of the Sun.\n\nFirst, it is incumbent upon every soul to set aside, purely for the sake of God, whatever they have heard and to turn to the sacred Writings. Likewise must they meditate upon the power, might, and arising, and all that hath been manifested from the Manifestation Himself. This is the Day whose mention hath been recorded in all the divine Books. Similarly was the mention of the appearance of Truth in these lands recorded - David in the Psalms declares: \"Sing praises to the Lord who dwelleth in Zion\" - and Zion is situated in these lands. He likewise says: \"Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces.\" He further declares: \"O Palestine, who will lead me into the strong city?\" - the gate of Palestine is Akka, and the strong city He mentions is Akka and its fortress, which is very strongly built. In numerous Tablets it is referred to as the Most Great Prison.\n\nIsaiah declares: \"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.\"\n\nO people of the earth! Consider the divine utterances that were sent down aforetime in the heavenly Books, and reflect, that perchance ye may turn from the spider's web toward the strong city which is today the seat of the Throne. He says God will in that Day punish the hosts on high in the heights, and likewise all the kings on earth. Even as in the days when the seat of the Throne was established at the gate of Jerusalem, all kings and subjects were summoned with the most exalted call to the highest horizon, in such wise that all the Concourse on high hearkened to that sweetest of calls and uttered \"Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!\"\n\nAmong these was a Tablet that was sent to His Majesty the Shah of Iran with a messenger. Should anyone consider and reflect upon the Surih of the Kings and likewise the Tablet to the Sultan, they would become aware of the sovereignty of Truth and bear witness to His power and majesty. By the life of God! The utterances of the All-Merciful will so attract them that they will find themselves detached from all contingent beings and all who dwell on earth, and will turn with perfect certitude and assurance with a single face toward the faces of the people of Baha, guiding the Concourse of creation to the holy and luminous Spot.\n\nHe likewise declares that all shall be gathered together as prisoners and confined in prison. Now consider that which was revealed by the Supreme Pen upon first arrival at the prison. He declares that glory was taken from two groups - from the kings \\[...\\]\n\nNow observe what was revealed by the Most Exalted Pen upon first arrival in the prison. He says that glory has been taken from two groups - from kings and from divines. This theme has been repeatedly revealed, and enlightened, steadfast and successful souls have seen and heard it. Blessed are they who have attained!\n\nIts effects are becoming more evident in the earth day by day, such that if one were to observe with the eye of truth, one would see the kings imprisoned and captive. Consider the kingdom of Paris, how it was seized - whatsoever was revealed concerning it has been fulfilled letter by letter. Likewise observe the Emperor of Russia - matters reached such a state that one was cast down upon the earth in utter abasement, while another has shut himself up in his palace, making it his residence, not daring to emerge except with numerous guards and protectors. By the life of God, the grave would be better and more preferable than such a palace!\n\nO people of the earth! Observe the power of God, how abasement has encompassed them all. Would that the people of the world had studied the Surih of the Kings, the blessed Surih of Ra'is, and the holy Tablets that were revealed upon first arrival in the Most Great Prison, that they might have become aware of God's power, might, greatness and knowledge, and might have arisen with perfect steadfastness to serve His Cause.\n\nThe Emperor of Germany, who is today the foremost person in the world, spoke these words himself in public: \"No security remains for us in the future, for we have witnessed how the great kingdom of the Emperor of Russia and the President of America were brought down with utmost audacity and insolence to utter humiliation and death. And this turmoil and upheaval has spread and continues to spread in all directions.\" Blessed is the king who today turns to the Truth and seeks glory, power and wealth from God, glorified be His majesty. Apart from this, there has been and is no remedy. The divine Books inform all, if they would turn to them. In this Revelation it has been explicitly mentioned that which had been hidden from hearts and eyes. How excellent is the fair-minded one who has been fair in God's Cause and has read what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Books, Psalms and Tablets. He is indeed among those endowed with insight before the Truth, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nAnd this power, might and greatness became manifest at a time when the Beauty of the All-Glorious One was imprisoned in the military barracks, with the door locked and officers standing guard, to such an extent that when the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - desired to go out through the door of the barracks to look upon it, the military officers prevented Him, that what had been revealed aforetime in the Books of the Messengers might be fulfilled. All that has occurred was mentioned and recorded in the divine Books. As this servant is mindful of brevity, he has therefore confined himself to these few words.\n\nThe greatness of this Day has been mentioned in such wise that in truth the very foundation of tranquility has been shaken. This evanescent one beseeches the Truth that He make that Beloved One's self influential, that He may water the trees of existence with the waters of wisdom and utterance, that perchance they may be adorned with choice fruits and delicate produce, and may attain to the station of fruit-bearing, which is the ultimate station. This is concerning the greatness of the days \\[...\\]\n\nAnd they shall attain unto the station of manifesting fruits, which is the ultimate station. It is concerning the greatness of these days and the greatness of the Cause that Isaiah the Prophet saith: \"Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.\" The purpose of these references is that all may know that the tidings of this Most Great Revelation, even the imprisonment and traversing the borders of the land and the like thereof, were revealed in the former Books. Otherwise, one must hearken with the ear of the spirit to the cooing of the Dove of Utterance, which is raised upon the loftiest branch of the Tree of Exposition, and cling fast thereunto. His exalted Word declareth: \"I have inscribed a gem concerning His remembrance, which is that He shall not be known through that which was mentioned in the Bayan.\" Should anyone contemplate this matter with fairness, he would acknowledge what God hath acknowledged and bear witness unto that which God hath testified. The Truth declareth that He cannot be known except through Himself, nor seen except through His own eyes. Whoso desireth to know Him must needs behold Him through His eyes. And peace be upon him who followeth the Truth, detached from all that the people possess.\n\nAs to your mention of the honored servant, His Excellency Haji Mirza Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon him be the glory of God, praise be to God, he is blessed with divine favors, and since the time he departed from the Land of Sirr until now, he hath not been forgotten. God willing, he was and shall ever be remembered by God. His petition in these days reached the Most Holy Court and an answer shall be bestowed. On behalf of this evanescent servant, convey to him greetings and salutations. I beseech the Exalted True One to aid him in that which beseemeth the Day of God. This servant also conveyeth to him that which expresseth the sincerity and love of this evanescent one's heart. I beseech God's confirmation for him in all conditions. Verily He is our Protector in this world and the next, and the Protector of those who, in this Day, have shattered the idols of imitation through the name of their Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about his utmost diligence and endeavor in the affairs of the friends, praise be to God Who hath enabled him to do this. What you have written befitteth him. God willing, the recompense for his deeds shall come from the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory. He is his Protector in this world and the next. There is no God but Him, the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. This servant had intended to trouble that beloved one with certain other petitions, but as he had done so a few days ago, he hath this time, in his own estimation, chosen brevity. He requesteth that beloved one to convey greetings and salutations to the friends of that land, upon whose foreheads is imprinted the seal \"The Kingdom is God's.\" It is hoped that through their steadfastness every disturbed one may find peace, every wavering one become firm, and every restless one find tranquility. The Command is in God's hands. He doeth and judgeth as He pleaseth, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty. May the glory that is manifest, evident, resplendent and luminous be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon them who have attained unto the days of God and have acted according to that which they were bidden in His mighty Book.\n\nThe Servant\n\n2 Jamadiyu'th-Thani\n\n=== END BH00024 ===\n\n=== START BH00025 ===\n\nPraise be to God Who delighteth His servant through the sweet savors of the utterances of His chosen ones, whose faces He hath honored by turning them away from aught else save Him, and whom He hath preserved through His might and dominion on a Day whereon the Herald calleth out from every direction: \"O concourse of creation! Purify your hearts, your ears, your tongues and your eyes for the recognition of the beauty of God, the Lord of all names, and for hearkening unto His most great verses. This is the Day of remembrance and praise, as hath been testified by Him Who cleaveth the heavens asunder. Blessed is he who, with certitude, hath turned towards God, the Cleaver of the daybreak, and woe betide him who hath remained heedless and turned away from the presence of his Lord when He came with power and sovereignty.\"\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whom every weary one hasteneth to the Kingdom of utterance and every thirsty one to the Kawthar of life! I beseech Thee by Thy name, the All-Merciful, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, cause them to speak Thy praise, enable them to make mention of Thee, acquaint them with Thy path, and aid them to serve Thy Cause. O my Lord! Thou seest them standing ready to manifest that which Thou hast willed in Thy days, and speaking forth the wondrous expressions of Thy remembrance. O my Lord! Draw them, then, through Thy Most Exalted Word in such wise that neither the veils of the divines nor the allusions of the mystics may grieve them. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth, and in Thy grasp are the kingdoms of all names. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nPraise be to God! Through His infinite bounties, they that have turned unto Him have attained unto a station whereof the people of the world are powerless to make mention. These are the souls unto whose loftiness and elevation all the Books and Scriptures have testified, and these are the servants who have cleared the paths of thorns and brambles and guided the people to the straight path. In truth, whosoever hath on this day succeeded in serving the Cause is accounted among those who are nigh unto God and is recorded in the Perspicuous Book. Today, every possessor of hearing perceiveth from all things the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory, and every possessor of sight beholdeth in all things the effulgences of the light of His countenance. This exalted and most holy station of this most mighty and most holy Day sufficeth, as He, exalted be His utterance, hath said: \"The Kingdom on that Day shall be God's.\"\n\nO thou beloved of My heart and remembered in My soul! God knoweth that thy remembrance bringeth joy and thy thought bestoweth delight. The letters which thou didst address to the Most Great Name, upon Him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, were presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court. His blessed and exalted Word is: O Haydar! We have accepted the hardships of the world and the afflictions of the nations, and have summoned all, with the most great call, to the ultimate goal and supreme height. Yet none have attained thereunto save the detached ones. That which thou didst write to him who circumambulated was mentioned before the Wronged One. Praise and gratitude be to God that He hath assisted thee to mention and extol Him and to serve His Cause. The Most Exalted Pen hath, time and again, testified to that which hath proceeded from thee in the path of God. For the love of God thou didst bear tribulations and afflictions, and wert assisted to deliver His Word. Every word that is uttered for the sake of God will assuredly manifest its influence in the earth at some appointed time. May God grant thee success in shattering the idols of vain imaginings and in rending the veils of idle fancies. The heedless people have been deprived of the Day of Meeting and Presence through the vain imaginings of the past. Each group hath clung to some vain fancy, especially the deniers among the people of the Bayan who are veiled by countless veils. They have gathered a handful of thorns and thistles from the knowledge of the divines of the Furqan and have called it the knowledge of God and obedience unto Him. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them without a command from the presence of an All-Knowing Commander! By the life of God! They are seen to be more remote than all peoples and religions, and they neither seek to derive anything from the Truth nor to comprehend it. And when anyone desireth to recite unto them from the verses of their Lord, they thrust their fingers in their ears even as they did aforetime. They are assuredly among the most lost in the perspicuous Book. In the days when all were concealed through fear, the Author of the Cause arose by Himself and, with the utmost power, might and ascendancy, summoned the people of delusion to the Name of the Self-Subsisting. He took hold of the essences of being, and when the fragrance of the pervading musk was somewhat diffused and the horizons of the hearts of some of the servants were illumined with the light of His countenance, croaking and buzzing emerged from behind the veil. Thus did their souls entice them. They are assuredly among the idolaters in the mighty Book. That honoured one must arise to promote the Cause in such wise that veils, allusions and troubles may not hold him back. Drink thou at all times the Salsabil of life in the name of thy Lord, the Revealer of religions. If thou hast borne hardships in God's path, been afflicted with exile, and heard taunts, thou hast also drunk from the cup of bounty from the hands of grace time after time. A single drop thereof excelleth all the treasures of the earth. O Haydar-'Ali! Rejoice thou that the Wronged One hath remembered thee from the Prison, whence thou dost inhale the fragrance of the bounty of His Name, the All-Merciful, throughout all possibility. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Behold and remember when We were with you upon the highest hills and We drank with you from the Chinese tea. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. To this do just servants testify. Then remember when thou wert present in the Garden, the place whereon was established the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nWe partook with you of Chinese tea. Indeed, nothing escapes His knowledge, as just witnesses among His servants do testify. Then remember when you were present in the Garden, the place where the throne of your Lord, the Most Merciful, was established, and you heard what the Tongue of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, did speak. Beware lest the doubts of the world prevent you from the Ancient Lord. Remember your Lord in such wise as to attract the hearts. We were with you when you were speaking in remembrance of your Lord. Blessed be your tongue for having spoken the truth, and your face for having turned towards My praiseworthy station. Convey My Great Glory to the faces of My loved ones who have drunk from the hand of My bounty, My Choice Wine that is sealed. Say: This is the Day of remembrance and praise, would that ye knew. This is the Day of deeds, would that ye understood. This is the Day of God, would that ye recognized. This is the Day of the Most Great Steadfastness - hold fast unto it in the name of your Lord, Who dominates over what was and what shall be. This is the Day of utterance, would that ye speak with wisdom. Give them glad tidings of My remembrance, My mercy, My loving-kindness, and what hath been ordained for them in My preserved Book. The glory rest upon you and upon them and upon him who at this hour writeth before the throne of his Lord, the Master of existence.\n\nPraise be to God that you have been and continue to be favored with divine grace. On one of the nights when these holy, impregnable, and transcendent verses were being revealed from the heaven of divine will specifically for you, He also mentioned the hill in Persian, and likewise your feast and the presence of the friends are exactly recorded in the divine books of old. He says there are feasts upon the heights and mountain peaks for the Lord of Hosts. Whatever hath appeared in this land was recorded letter by letter in the divine books of old. Blessed are they who have attained! Blessed are they who know! In all the books, the appearance of the Manifestation in this land was promised, as well as in its surroundings. Some people have come from other countries and settled around this blessed and holy land, saying the Manifestation is near and we have come to attain and comprehend it. Nevertheless, they are observed to be in great heedlessness. Their leader sought to attain the presence some years ago, but this request was not accepted in the Most Holy Court. However, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for him, and in that Tablet was recorded that which would save every fair-minded one and lead every seeker to his goal. Nevertheless, the truth of the blessed words \"None shall touch it save the purified ones\" became manifest. In short, they did not attain to even a drop from the ocean of its meanings, and they are still waiting as did the people before them. And with them are a hundred thousand regrets and sorrows that they are deprived and forbidden from the overflowing grace and infinite mercy of God. The Command is in God's hands - He gives and withholds, and He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nO Hussein! Verily We have mentioned thee before, and We make mention of thee on this night which hath been illumined by the lights of the Countenance, as the Ancient Beauty walketh in His Most Great Prison. Thou hast turned unto Us and We have turned unto thee. Be thou thankful and be of them that remember. Preserve what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen even as thou preservest thy spirit and thy sight. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Be thou vocal in the remembrance of thy Lord and steadfast in the service of His loved ones. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is a Book which none hath comprehended save God, the Lord of all worlds. He Who loved Me and became a captive in My path hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with that which perisheth not, whereunto every just and discerning one beareth witness. Say: O people! Cast aside the cups of idle fancies and take up the chalices in the name of your Lord, the Munificent Bestower. Give thanks that the Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee and hath sent down for thee this perspicuous remembrance. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd likewise concerning Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, whose mention was in your book, these decisive verses were revealed from the heaven of divine will: O Siyyid Aqa! The Lord of Names giveth thee glad tidings from the prison's precinct and maketh mention of thee with a mention through which the sincere ones shall find the fragrance of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the name upon which My Pen hath moved, and the tongue that hath spoken My praise, and the heart that hath turned unto My glorious and beloved Kingdom. He Who circleth round Me hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee as a bounty from the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Preserve the verses of thy Lord, then recite them with spirit and fragrance. Verily they shall profit thee in the Hereafter and in this world, as witnesseth He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. Set aside the doubters with their vain desires and take what thou hast been commanded by God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Verily We have commanded all in the Book with that which shall profit them in this world and the next, whereunto beareth witness My Supreme Pen and beyond it the Lord of creation Who speaketh in the prison that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Verily We counsel Our servants with the Most Great Trustworthiness and command them with that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of existence. The Glory be upon you and upon My handmaidens who have heard the Call and have attained unto the Promised Day.\n\nAnd in this station, O Haydar-'Ali, the Tongue of God, Lord of earth and heaven, makes mention of thee once again that thou mayest give thanks and be of them that rejoice. Turn thy face, incline thy heart, raise thy finger and say: O peoples of the world! By God, He Who was hidden in the tabernacle of grandeur, concealed in the pavilion of infallibility, and inscribed in the Books of God, Lord of all worlds, hath appeared. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and deny not Him Who calleth you unto God, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nGod willing, may you engage in the promotion of God's Cause with all your heart, tongue, limbs and eyes. Your mention and that which hath befallen you hath not been, nor ever shall be, effaced from the Book of the world. His honor Ism-i-Jud, who was with Me and who now circleth round My throne - upon him be My glory which was, hath sent what thou didst send unto him. When it was read before the Face, this perspicuous Tablet was revealed.\n\nGod willing, thou shalt summon, with wisdom and utterance, all who dwell in the realm of possibility to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Whatsoever is sent should all be written down and, with the utmost wisdom, read to some who are worthy in certain villages and cities. Now, day and night, Tablets are being revealed and dispatched to various regions. We have explicitly forbidden all from conflict, contention, corruption and whatsoever is abhorrent to minds and souls, and have commanded that which leadeth to the exaltation of the Word and the manifestation of man's station.\n\nOf the verses and tablets that are sent, some must record copies thereof and preserve them. Indeed, the utmost effort and diligence must be exerted in preserving the divine verses. Some friends, should a polytheist enter their home, all their writings fall into his hands before any search, and this is and hath been extremely unwise. The dispatch of Tablets from this direction must remain concealed, except from souls who are trustworthy, reliable and steadfast, for should the deniers and polytheists become aware, they might arise to prevent and create mischief. This servant submits these petitions outwardly as they accord with wisdom, otherwise knowledge is with God and I am but an ignorant one far removed.\n\nThat you wrote you had delivered the divine Tablets to their intended recipients - a hundred thousand times blessed be you and every soul who hath attained unto God's Tablet and its effect. It is evident that your honor hath exerted and continues to exert the utmost effort in service to the Cause. This matter is more manifest than the sun in the presence of Him Who is visible and evident.\n\nYou mentioned the Naddafs, upon them be the Glory of God. The honorable Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, has repeatedly made mention of them in the Most Holy Court, and wondrous, sublime verses have been revealed concerning them. God willing, they have and will continue to attain unto these. Likewise, two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were specifically revealed for them and were entrusted to Shaykh S. to deliver. In truth, they have in no wise fallen short in serving the Cause. We beseech God to protect them from the clamor of the heedless, the croaking of the croakers, and the doubts of certain followers of the Bayan who are in truth among the people of the coffin. O my Beloved! This servant is greatly perplexed, for these followers of the Bayan, who today are heedless of and have turned away from the King of the Bayan and what He has sent down and revealed, have never had any knowledge of this Cause and its foundation from the beginning, yet they strive to lead astray receptive souls and represent themselves to everyone as those who believed at the outset of the Cause and are fully informed of all matters. Some poor souls, being uninformed, might be barred and veiled from the divine path through the deceit, duplicity and guile of those remote and veiled souls. By Him Who speaks and has caused all things to speak His praise and glorification, this evanescent servant has neither seen nor heard the like of such souls. The servant begs his Lord to protect His servants from the evil of those who have cast the Cause of God behind their backs and followed every rebellious satan. In any case, the honored Naddafs, upon them be the Glory of God, are mentioned in His presence. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. That which they sent to the exalted matron, the mother of the household, upon her be the Glory of God, was received and presented at the Most Holy Court.\n\nAnd regarding your mention of Aqa Mirza Mahmud and his family, upon them be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. In these days, a wondrous and sublime Tablet was specifically revealed for them from the heaven of the All-Merciful's grace, and its bearer is Shaykh S. who will be departing for those parts in the next few days. Likewise, again on this most luminous night, a new Tablet has been revealed from the heaven of the will of the Lord of Destiny and will be sent. God willing, may they drink and give others to drink of the choice wine of inner meanings from the divine ocean of utterance. This evanescent servant conveys to them a wondrous and sublime greeting that is sanctified above the limitations, allusions and words of this servant, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid them to teach the Cause and to remain steadfast with the greatest steadfastness. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Helper, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Jinab Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim (Ibn Javahiri Qumi), this evanescent servant beseeches God to keep him steadfast upon His straight path, that he may be as a key to unlock the doors of the hearts of the servants. God willing, may they open in the name of Truth so that the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation may encompass and surround all, through the grace and favor of the Goal of all the worlds. It is hoped that he will be observed as a lamp, bright and luminous in that city, that all may find their way by that light to the Supreme Horizon and attain their ultimate purpose which is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. In any case, mention of him was made in the Most Holy and Supreme Court, and one most mighty, most impregnable and most holy Tablet was revealed for him from the Kingdom of the utterance of the All-Merciful and was dispatched. God willing, may he drink from the chalices of the words of the Revealer of Names and Attributes and from that wine of inner meanings, and become intoxicated and arise to guide the servants in the assemblage of the world through the name of the Lord of Eternity. In all conditions may he not let go of wisdom, for all matters are, in the sight of God, dependent upon and connected with wisdom. For instance, if wisdom does not dictate it, teaching is not permissible. This is a word which this evanescent servant has repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed is he who has cast aside his own will and held fast to the Will of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Shah-Abad and the enthusiasm of the loved ones, as well as the acceptance of certain souls and their gathering around the unifying Word of God - all was presented in the Most Holy Court, and these brilliant verses were revealed from the heaven of will especially for them. He says, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious \\[...\\]\n\nThis Book hath been revealed in truth by the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, for those who have shattered the idols of vain imaginings and idle fancies. In the name of God, the Possessor of all that was and that shall be! O My loved ones throughout the land! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised in truth. Blessed are they who hear. Rejoice in that ye have been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen on this Day whereon the Temple of the Manifestation hath been established upon the Most Great Throne and hath proclaimed: \"There is none other God but I, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\"\n\nAll must engage in teaching the Cause with utmost joy and radiance, in accordance with the wisdom set forth in the Tablets. Should someone not be eloquent in speech, let him assist the teacher. It would be most regrettable if, in this day, any soul should be deprived of serving the Cause, for the deeds of this Day are accounted among the most exalted of all deeds in the sight of God. God willing, may all be enabled to achieve that which will cause the exaltation of God's Word. The gaze of the Wronged One hath ever been and shall continue to be directed towards His friends and loved ones. Verily, He heareth and seeth them. Ere long shall the world and all that is therein pass away, while that which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning the people of Baha shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.\n\nO friends! Strive ye to attain the wine of steadfastness and drink from the stream of certitude. All religious groups have been nurtured on vain imaginings and idle fancies; thus are they deprived of the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth. Consider those who have turned away among the people of the Bayan: though they count themselves enlightened and saved, they are now regarded by God as more debased than all the peoples of the earth, for they cling to imaginings the like of which hath never been seen before, and they persist with the utmost determination in leading astray receptive souls. While claiming faith in the Bab, they have visited upon His Messenger and Revealer that which no oppressor hath ever wrought, and have uttered that which no idolator hath ever spoken. God protect us and you from their evil. Say:\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou through the sweetness of Whose utterance the sincere ones have hastened to the court of Thy door, and through the lights of Whose countenance the devoted ones have turned towards the horizon of Thy grace! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou hast subdued the kingdom of earth and heaven, to aid us in remembering Thee, glorifying Thee, and serving Thy Cause throughout Thy lands. Thou art He, O my God, Who hath made known to us the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy wisdom, and the sun of Thy Revelation. I implore Thee not to deprive us of steadfastness in Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, the One endowed with great bounty. Inscribe for us, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, that which Thou hast inscribed for those whom neither the doubts of the divines have prevented from turning unto Thee, nor the idle fancies of the followers of the Bayan from beholding the horizon of Thy favor. O Lord! Grant us from the chalice of steadfastness such measure that neither the veils of the world shall prevent us from turning unto Thee, nor the dark clouds of the nations from facing towards Thy direction. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO beloved of my heart! A hundred thousand regrets that the power of discernment and perception in the world is as rare as the philosopher's stone. By Him Who created me, manifested me, caused me to know Him, drew me nigh unto Him, and made me a servant of His Cause - were all the peoples of the world to become imbued with the fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance, they would all be seen circling round His presence. A hundred thousand pities that they are deprived of this peerless bounty. The cause and reason for the deprivation of the servants are the divines of the age, who have prevented these helpless souls from the imperishable, matchless, never-failing crystal waters of the Eternal One, and have occupied them with unseemly words and allusions. God, exalted be His glory, saith in the Hidden Words: \"O YE THAT ARE FAIR IN HUE, YET INWARDLY FOUL! Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is pure and clean, yet when tested by the Divine Assayer, not a drop thereof will He accept.\" The example of these divines is like unto one who hath gathered many pebbles and thinketh that what he hath are jewels, while all that he hath collected from first to last would not equal one carat of diamond. Yet the poor wretch is heedless and unaware of this. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted and mighty be He, to open the eyes and illumine them with the light of knowledge. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nConvey my greetings to Hasan Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God. May he, God willing, be enabled to mention God, serve His Cause, and remain steadfast in His Faith. I swear by the Sun of existence that all the world shall perish save those deeds that have been and shall be manifested in the path of God. Likewise, I convey my sincere greetings to Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, and I beseech God to enable him to attain that which is pleasing in this day. God willing, may he achieve the most great steadfastness and be so enkindled with the fire of divine love that the polytheists and deniers among the people of the Bayan shall be powerless to extinguish it. Convey my greetings to him and mention that by the life of God, certain treacherous, vain and false souls have set about to lead astray the souls who have accepted the Faith, despite having no knowledge whatsoever of the essence of this Cause, and in this luminous morn they have deprived people of the wine of divine knowledge. His honor should drink from the cup of steadfastness in the name of Truth - a drink after which no thirst shall seize him and he shall see all else but God as absolute nothingness and sheer non-existence. Time and again this evanescent one hath heard these words from the Divine tongue, exalted be His glory: \"This is the Day of God; none shall be mentioned save Him. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him and attained. Woe betide them that have turned away.\"\n\nLikewise I send greetings and praise to Mulla Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God. I hope that he will arise to serve the Cause with perfect steadfastness - an arising that none on earth can prevent. Praise be to God, mention of him has flowed from the Supreme Pen both before and after, and the gaze of loving-kindness has been directed toward him. He should be so enkindled that its effects become manifest throughout the earth. However, in all things wisdom must be observed, such that the clamor of the ignorant ones who are known as the learned is not raised. They should gauge the earth and sow the seeds of wisdom. That some are openly engaged in teaching among both friend and foe - this matter is not favored at the Divine Threshold. The time for open proclamation has passed. After the martyrdom of the Most Wondrous One (Badi'), upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy, all have been commanded to observe wisdom. They must be mindful of it in all conditions, for some of the friends are seen to be troubled, depressed and dejected when trials appear. Yet our Lord, the All-Merciful, is verily the Compassionate, the Generous. My spirit, my soul, and my being be a sacrifice for His compassion, His mercy, and His loving-kindness.\n\nO friends! This evanescent servant submits with utmost humility and nothingness: Know ye the value of this Day. All those near to God and the sincere ones uttered the words \"Would that I...\" and at all times beseeched and hoped from God that they might attain this supreme honor and mighty gift. And ye, praise be to God, have attained it through God's infinite bounty and have quaffed from the sealed wine. Now this servant and the masters must, with perfect unity and harmony, utter praise and thanksgiving to God, exalted be His glory, recognize the value of this supreme blessing, and act upon that which today causes the exaltation of His Cause. In all the Books, Scriptures, Psalms, Tablets and Epistles, triumph has been made conditional upon patience, calm, dignity, spiritual qualities and goodly deeds. We beseech God, may His favors be universal, to aid all to observe His commandments revealed in His Book. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, in the beginning and the end.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the friends in Sultan-abad, and likewise what you mentioned about Mulla Ibrahim and Ustad Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God - all was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke these sublime and decisive words. He says, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Exalted\n\nO friends! These are the days of the All-Merciful, and the Living Waters flow and stream forth from the Dayspring of generosity. God willing, with illumined hearts, radiant faces, and brilliant brows, ye shall take from the Hand of bounty and drink in the name of the Peerless Friend. Were ye to ponder the words that shine forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen, such rapture and longing would seize all that ye would see all else as non-existent, and would arise with all your limbs and members to serve the Friend with such steadfastness that neither the doubts and insinuations of the learned and the ignorant would prevent you nor hold you back from this supreme good and mighty favor.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Remind the servants of what hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord's will, the All-Merciful, and give them the glad-tidings of His great bounty. Say: O ye who are beloved of the All-Merciful! Hold fast today unto that which befitteth the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest the doubts of men debar you from the Truth. Cling ye to the hem of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. By the life of God! This is a Day that hath no equal among days. Strive that there may appear from you that which will draw you nigh unto the One, the All-Informed. From My Most Great Prison I send greetings to My loved ones there, and counsel them with that whereby their names shall be exalted between the heavens and the earths. This is the Day for deeds, this is the Day for goodly character, and thy Lord is the Creator, the Fashioner, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Ibrahim! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, when sorrows encompassed Him through what the hands of the heedless have wrought. Be thou steadfast, firm and constant in serving this Cause, whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding have been perturbed and the feet of the learned have slipped, save whom God hath willed, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. All the treasures of earth cannot equal My remembrance of thee. Know thou its worth, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nWe make mention of Husayn, after the Master, that the call of the Lord of creation may attract him on the Day of Return in such wise that he will arise and say with wisdom and utterance: O concourse of creation! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One while He was imprisoned in this mighty fortress. Let not the affairs of the world grieve thee. Leave them to their people and take hold of that which thou hast been commanded in the Book of God, the Goal of them that have recognized Him.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Convey unto them My remembrance, My loving-kindness, My bounty and My mercy that have preceded all creation, that there may appear from them what God hath desired in this holy and wondrous Day. Thus have We revealed from the chambers of words the maidens of inner meanings and utterance. Blessed is he who hath witnessed, seen and recognized the signs of his Lord, the Most Great, in both beginning and end. Woe unto the heedless! Woe unto those who turn away! Woe unto them that slumber!\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad Hakim, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and likewise regarding their turning to the Most Exalted Horizon, it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Glorious Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, and His Word is the Truth:\n\n\"O Muhammad! Hear the call of the Wronged One from the direction of the prison. He summons thee to the Truth and calls thee to a station whose mention hath been recorded in the divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures of the past and present. O Muhammad! In days when, due to the multitude of tribulations and afflictions, day could not be distinguished from night, this Wronged One arose alone to promote the Cause - an arising which the clamor of all the peoples of the earth failed to deter Him from that which God had purposed. With the most exalted call He guided the people of the Kingdom of Utterance to the Most Exalted Horizon. He made manifest the straight Path of God so that the peoples of the earth might not be deprived of the outpouring grace of the True One. Yet when the Path became manifest, the Cause of God became resplendent, and the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of His Revelation, all arose in complete opposition, except those whom thy Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earth, willed otherwise.\n\nGod, exalted be His glory, is My witness and testimony that for not a moment did I conceal Myself or seek to preserve My life. In all conditions, the exaltation of God's Cause and the glorification of His Most Exalted Word were the apparent and hidden objects of My gaze. All the people of the Bayan bear witness to what hath been mentioned, except those souls who are deprived of the ocean of fairness and are barred from the Most Exalted Horizon. And when the breezes of divine loving-kindness wafted and the fragrance of the celestial Robe was partly diffused, a group arose in hypocrisy and rushed to all regions that they might perhaps extinguish the souls that were aflame with the fire of love. Such is the condition of the servants on the Day of Return. Glory be to God! They have become heedless of the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, and have turned to souls who have never had, nor have, any knowledge of the root of the Cause.\n\nYour honor should, with the utmost joy and fragrance, make the people of the contingent world aware, that perchance through the grace of the Life-Giving Kawthar they may be purified from the conditions of self and passion and turn towards the Most Exalted Kingdom. The station and rank of this renowned Day is most great, yet the people are observed to be exceedingly heedless. God willing, they will arise from the slumber of negligence through the Most Sweet Call and turn to the ocean of knowledge.\n\nO Muhammad! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Verily, He mentioneth thee for the sake of God and commandeth thee that which shall profit thee in all the worlds of His worlds. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Cast away what thou hast heard from those who cannot distinguish their right hand from their left, and take hold of that which thou hast been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Take the Sealed Wine in My Name, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, it will attract thee to a station wherein the conditions of the world will not prevent thee from the Lord of Eternity. Thy Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Counsel the servants to be steadfast with supreme steadfastness, as bidden by the Lord of all beings. Verily, He commandeth them that which shall profit them in the Hereafter and in this world. To this testifieth His perspicuous Book.\"\n\nFrom these verses and utterances of the Lord of Names and Attributes, the divine bounty and grace towards His servants is manifest and evident. God is My witness that this servant observeth himself to be bewildered most of the time, for the horizons of the worlds of inner meanings \\[...\\]\n\nI testify that this servant observes himself bewildered at most times, for though the horizons of the worlds of meaning and utterance are illumined and radiant from the Sun of Revelation, yet the servants are seen in utter heedlessness and remoteness. They are so intoxicated with the wine of pride that they cannot distinguish between what benefits and what harms them. They have been and are wandering lost and dumbfounded in the waterless desert. God willing, may those souls who have been blessed with the mention of God, exalted be His glory, in these pages be confirmed in serving the Cause, educating the servants, and quickening the dead. This evanescent servant offers greetings to each one and gives them glad tidings through the mentions of the Supreme Pen. May God confirm them in that which befits this blessed Day. Verily He confirmeth whomsoever He willeth through a command from His presence, and He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote that if someone other than your honor should turn towards those regions, it would become the cause and means of enkindling the fire of love - this matter is clear and evident. However, let Ali-Qabel-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power, and likewise Ibn-Ismu'llah-al-Asdaq-al-Muqaddas, upon them both be the Glory of God, and Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor, send whomever they deem advisable with holy and impregnable Tablets, that perchance the breezes of the All-Merciful may seize the hearts of the people of those lands and lead them to the ocean of wisdom. In this matter, they must exert mighty efforts so that the breezes of revelation may not be cut off from cities and regions, and ears may not be deprived of the Call. There must be no delay in sending souls and teaching the Cause. Souls must be made aware of the path of teaching God's Cause, that they may speak with complete wisdom among the people and make them conscious of the true purpose and outcome of God's Cause. In this way, the suns of steadfastness will shine forth from the horizons of hearts and illumine the world. Blessed are they who know, blessed are they who act.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Haji Siyyid Abu'l-Fadl, it was submitted. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for him. God willing, may he attain unto it and act according to what God has willed.\n\nLikewise you mentioned Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], son of L.T., and his namesake. Praise be to God, the aforementioned one has been acknowledging and confessing this Most Great Cause from the earliest days, and has been adorned with the mantle of the grace of the True One, exalted be His grandeur. Now he is seen to be more steadfast and more enkindled than before. This evanescent servant beseeches and implores the eternal True One, exalted be His glory, to make him appear as a standard upon the hills among His servants and to continually elevate his station. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet has been revealed especially for him. May he recite it with spirit and fragrance and drink from the flowing Kawthar that lies hidden in the depths of the divine words. Happiness and joy be unto him! And as for his namesake, mention of him was made in the letter he sent to this servant, and likewise in your letter which you had sent to Jinab-i-Ism-i-Jud, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, wherein his acceptance, his turning to God and his steadfastness were mentioned. Both were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Mighty, Most High Court. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His grandeur: \"Praise be to God, he has attained to the recognition of the Divine Word and has acknowledged and confessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken. His degrees of eagerness and longing are manifest and evident before the Divine Presence. God willing, with perfect wisdom may he drink from the Kawthar of utterance of the Lord of all possibilities.\" End quote. And one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet has also been revealed especially for him from the heaven of the All-Merciful's will. God willing, may he drink and cause others to drink from the oceans of inner meanings and utterance that lie hidden in the words of the Lord of religions.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about Ustad Hasan-i-Sabbagh, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], it was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply: \"We have mentioned him before from My Most Exalted Pen and We mention him again at this time that he may thank his Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. God willing, may he be confirmed in that which befits this most wondrous Day and be assisted in that whereby the Cause of God, the Exalted, the Great, may be uplifted. O Haydar-i-Qabli-'Ali! Convey My glorification unto his face and remind him of the verses of his Lord, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and the earths. And We make mention in this station of his son who is named Nasru'llah and We give him the glad tidings of My gifts and favors that he may praise and be of the thankful ones. And We counsel him to the Greater Steadfastness and to that which hath been sent down in My Perspicuous Book.\" End quote.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The Tongue of My utterance in the Kingdom of My knowledge beareth witness that thou hast attained unto that which was most meritorious in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We were with you both, hearing and seeing, for We are the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have accepted your devotion and what ye have done in the path of God, the Lord of all religions. The failure to receive a letter and delay in response was not due to lack of acceptance. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Rejoice in thy Lord's favor, for He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nWhatsoever appeareth for the sake of God is known unto Him and achieveth the honor of acceptance. Blessed are they who attain, purely for the sake of God, unto that which ye have attained. O Ghulam-'Ali! Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and know of a certainty that whatsoever thou hast manifested in God's path hath been accepted before His Presence. The deed of no doer hath ever been, nor shall ever be, lost with God. Be thou assured of that which My Most Exalted Pen hath pronounced, and be of the thankful ones.\n\nI testify that thou hast heard the Call and turned unto God, the Lord of Names, and visited a Place that hath ever been under the watchful gaze of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. By God's life! The Concourse on High and a company of angels have visited it, and ere long the tribes of the earth shall turn unto it. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and shown thee His straight and manifest path.\n\nThe rewards for goodly deeds and pure words are treasured and preserved with God. The Tongue of the All-Merciful beareth witness to this, yet most people are heedless. From these decisive verses of God, the bounty of the True One is evident and manifest. In truth I say, from every word the Sun of Grace doth shine forth. Blessed art thou and those who were with thee. Praise be to God that ye have attained this supreme bounty and are mentioned and recorded in God's Book as among the people of the Crimson Ark. In truth, this station is sanctified above all outward descriptions that flow from the pen, for mention of it hath been revealed and sent down from the Tongue of Grandeur. A hundred thousand blessings upon the soul that hath attained unto this most exalted station.\n\nRegarding what thou didst write about Aqa Mirza Habibu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented and He showed loving-kindness and revealed a most holy, most exalted, most glorious Tablet especially for him. God willing, his eyes shall be illumined by beholding it and his heart gladdened by its perusal. He hath indeed attained unto the pearls of the ocean of his Lord's utterance. The servant giveth him the glad tidings of this wondrous Tablet and congratulateth him on this great bounty.\n\nThe Pen of the Most High conveys greetings to those who drink the choice wine of the Most Glorious, and says: Today is the day of service and the triumph of the Cause. Deprive not yourselves of the bounties of these days and their fragrances. With the utmost wisdom, steadfastness, kindliness and forbearance, remind the people that perchance they may attain unto new life through the divine Kawthar of bounty, and through the divine Word attain the ultimate goal and the most exalted summit. Today the sun of grace is shining; strive that ye may succeed in deeds befitting this divine Day. Your mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for each one that which is like unto imperishable treasures with the Trustworthy, the All-Knowing. All the things of the world cannot equal this blessed word. Be ye thankful unto your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nYe should guide the people through goodly deeds, pure words, and revealed wisdom, and God willing, occupy yourselves with the triumph of the Cause through spiritual qualities and praiseworthy attributes. We, from this station, send Our greetings unto you and give you glad tidings of God's grace and mercy, and enjoin upon you that which hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Ye should soar with the wings of unity in this holy atmosphere and appear amongst the people with utmost love and fellowship. He verily is with you under all conditions. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nAll handmaidens are remembered in God's mention. O leaves of the blessed Tree! He hath turned toward you and sayeth: Ye must all be adorned with the ornament of sanctity and clothed in the garments of purity. Beseech ye the Exalted One to illumine the crown of deeds with the diadem of protection. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nYe have attained unto days for which those near unto God, the sincere ones, and the faithful ones beseeched God, exalted be His glory. Be not grieved or saddened by outward matters and the affairs of this transient world. The mortal world is unworthy of mention. Soon will the people of the earth return to their abode with utmost regret and manifest loss. That which endureth in the book of this world and the books of other worlds, throughout the duration of the Most Beautiful Names, is a mention that is inscribed today by the Most Exalted Pen in the crimson scroll. Strive to attain unto it and preserve it through the Name of God. None but God hath been and shall be capable of mentioning this station. It behooveth all to offer praise and thanksgiving unto God at all times. Blessed is the servant who hath attained, blessed the handmaiden who hath attained, blessed the servant who hath acknowledged, and blessed the handmaiden who hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered before the creation of the heavens and earth: \"Verily, there is no God but Me, the All-Informed, the All-Seeing.\"\n\nYou wrote that Jinab-i-Aqa Abdul-Hussein, known as Eliyahu, was in the land of K where the hostile faction rose up against him. This is not the first oppression that has appeared from the oppressors in these days, nor is it the first vessel that has been broken in the path of God, nor is he the first man to be afflicted with the gloating of enemies. In any case, his situation was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and He said: \"God willing, may the entire world be adorned with the ornament of recognition of the Ancient Lord, and arise to support the Cause of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. Today, engagement in crafts and trades is counted as worship. It is necessary, nay obligatory, upon all to be occupied with some profession or work. Idleness, inaction, seclusion, unemployment and laziness have never been and are not pleasing in the sight of God. God willing, may all attain and act upon that which God has commanded.\"\n\nConvey greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to him and mention that engagement in affairs is also considered service in its proper place. God willing, may souls who have accepted the Faith attain unto the most great steadfastness - and the most great steadfastness is a station wherein whosoever attains unto it beholds all save God as non-existent and null, even if he should bring forth all that people possess.\n\nRegarding what was written about this servant using the word \"Malik-i-Yawm'ut-Talaq\" with a \"ta\" (without dots), while it appears it should be with a dotted \"ta\" - both are correct. For \"Yawm'ut-Talaq\" with an undotted \"ta\" refers to the Day of Resurrection, as it is the Day of Separation. Since the Greatest Separation occurs on that Day, in some instances it is written with an undotted \"ta\". Similarly, with a dotted \"ta\" it means \"meeting\", and since that Most Great Day is the day of meeting, in some instances it is written with a dotted \"ta\". This is the Day when different parties gather in one place and conflicting conditions turn toward one destination. This is the Day of Meeting, this is the Day of Encounter, this is the Day of Coming Together, this is the Day of Separation, this is the Day of the Greatest Distinction, this is the Day of Assembly. By the life of my Beloved and thy Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and earth, the Calamity has come and struck, the Inevitable has appeared and taken hold, and the Hour has emerged and come to pass.\n\nIn the days when the Sun of Manifestation was rising from the horizon of Iraq, but due to the incompletion of the appointed time was still veiled behind the clouds of wisdom, one day the Ancient Beauty came out from the private quarters, and in the outer room Haji Muhammad-Taqi from Nayriz - upon him be the Glory of God - was present with this servant. In those days no one was aware of the true nature of the Cause, all were heedless, and due to the intensity of concealment all were forbidden, even though, by His very Self, the Cause was more evident than the sun. However, the utterances of the Truth Itself kept people bewildered. In those days such matters occurred that were they to be mentioned, all would cry out \"What longing!\" In any case, at that moment the Tongue of Grandeur, addressing Haji Muhammad-Taqi, spoke saying: \"Haji Muhammad-Taqi, I was seated when I saw the promised Hour walking.\" They said: \"O Haji Muhammad-Taqi, the promised Hour mentioned in the Bayan walked in this manner\" - and They demonstrated the walk - and repeatedly said: \"Haji, look, look, It walked just like this, It walked just like this.\" Glory be to God! Despite this most great Revelation, since concealment was decreed, no one in those days was aware save a few, and even those few only according to their capacity, not according to what He truly is, exalted be His glory, universal be His bounty, magnificent be His station, and there is no God but Him.\n\nRegarding what was written about having copied the wondrous and exalted Tablets that were revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning the meaning of assistance, and having them on hand for all to see and become aware of divine assistance and its meaning - this matter is truly a great service to the Cause of God. However, previously also there was revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning the meaning of assistance that which is the cause of guidance and remembrance for all on earth. God willing, obtain those also and add them to what you have written, so that all may understand that the Manifestation of Truth, exalted be His glory, is for the reformation of the world, not for killing, plundering, corruption, discord, persecution and the like.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad-Hashim (from K) and other friends of God - this was presented at the Most Holy Court, and verses were specifically revealed from the horizon of Divine Will for each one. God willing, they will perceive their fragrance, for if all who are on earth were to truly perceive the fragrance of but one of the Divine Words, they would find themselves sanctified, holy, detached and free. Blessed is the soul who has attained to this most exalted, most glorious station. This is what was revealed for Muhammad-Hashim:\n\nIn My Name, the Witness, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed\n\nA mention from Us to those in the world, that the mention may draw them nigh unto a station which God hath sanctified from the doubts of them who have denied the Day of Judgment. O Hashim! Rejoice in that thou art remembered by Him Who hath arisen in the name of the Self-Subsisting, and hath shattered the idols of learning through His Name, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have ordained knowledge for the recognition of the Known One, and that whereby the servants may benefit, not that which every ignorant deluded one may utter. Blessed is the face that hath turned to the Face of God, the ear that hath heard the Call, and the tongue that hath spoken this Most Great Name. Beware lest the doubts of men hold thee back from the Lord of Destiny. Leave what the people possess and take what thou hast been given by the One Who is Kind, the Generous. We make mention of thy family and those with thee as a favor from Us - verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient. And from this station We send Our greetings upon them and upon those who have laid hold of this firm Cord.\n\nThis is what was revealed for Mirza Suha (from Sul?anabad):\n\nIn the Name of the Peerless Beloved\n\nThe Lord of Names saith: Strive that through God's favor - glorified be His majesty - thou mayest be named a shooting star, that is, a brilliant, manifest meteor. The existence of the friends and their steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of Names is light unto them who have turned towards Him and fire unto the idolaters. God willing, thou shalt shine forth like the morning star from the horizon of the heaven of God's love. This is a Day wherein every soul can acquire that which leadeth to elevation and ascension. How many souls there were who yearned for this wondrous, glorious Day, yet when the dawn of God's Day appeared, all turned away. Beseech God that He may sanctify all from the abasement of self and passion and draw them to the highest horizon. This is the true blessing and the heavenly food. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto, and woe unto him who hath deprived himself of God's blessing and bounties, His grace and favors. Beseech God - glorified be His majesty - that He may aid thee in a matter which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Glory be from the Wronged One upon those who have attained unto this mighty station.\n\nThis is what was revealed for Master Husayn K:\n\nIn My Name, the Hearing, the All-Knowing\n\nO Husayn! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison and calleth thee unto God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We have entered the prison and have sent down verses in such wise as none can reckon save God, the Lord of Lords. Be thou vocal in praise of thy Lord and act according to what the All-Bestowing hath revealed in the Book. Blessed is the strong one whom the conditions of creation have not weakened, and the one who hath turned toward God whom the signs of the veiled ones have not hindered. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's grace and glorify Him at eventide and at dawn. Give thanks that thou hast attained unto the outpourings of My Most Exalted Pen, which when it moveth, the Herald proclaimeth: \"The Swift to Account hath come!\" Thus hath the ocean of My grace surged for thee as a bounty from My presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe make mention of him who is named Hashim and give him glad tidings through this Remembrance which hath been sent down in truth from God, the Lord of all men. And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad that he may rejoice in the bounty of his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Husayn (K) who attained in Zawra. He is the Witness and the Witnessed. A Book sent down by the Sovereign of existence from His praiseworthy station to him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed is he who hath sought the fragrance of the Intended One, and the seeker who hath answered the Desired One, and the learned one who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. How many learned ones have turned away from the Path, and how many ignorant ones have recognized, hastened, and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!\" By God, the horizon of the world hath been illumined by the Most Great Light, yet most of the people perceive not. Verily the Truth walketh before the faces of creation. He Who speaketh at the heart of contingent being beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Powerful over what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath advanced, turned to God and attained unto His presence, and woe unto every one who hath turned away and rejected God by following every heedless one cast out.\n\nThis is what was revealed for him who is named his honor Siyyid Baqir K. He is the Hearing, the Responding. Today all things are ablaze from the fire of the Divine Word, and all atoms of creation speak forth \"The Revealer of Verses hath come!\" Blessed is the soul that hath hearkened unto the voice of the One Who conversed on Sinai from the Tree of Manifestation and hath arisen with all its heart and spirit to the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds. The mention of this glorious and wondrous Day in the divine Books is more evident than the sun at its zenith. Blessed is the eye that hath attained to its vision and the heart that hath turned toward the most exalted horizon. O Baqir! If thou wert to thank God throughout the duration of the kingdom of earth and heaven, it would not equal this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet. Know thou the value of the words of the Most Merciful and preserve them as thou wouldst thy life. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon thee and upon thy father and upon those who have attained unto this mighty station.\n\nO Siyyid Rida, the Lord of Names saith: Strive thou to attain unto the good-pleasure of God, exalted be His glory. This station hath no peer or likeness, and all the sincere ones, those drawn nigh, and the pure in heart have sought and continue to seek it. Verily thy Lord speaketh the truth and guideth whom He willeth to His straight path. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nThis is what was revealed for his honor who is named Mulla Muhammad Rida K. He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great. O Muhammad Rida! The heaven of bounty is upraised and the sun of manifestation is shining and visible from its horizon. This is the Day promised in all the heavenly Books. Today is the day of awareness. The Peerless Knower saith: The gate of grace is opened and the ocean of mercy is manifest before all faces. Strive that ye may receive your portion from the bountiful outpourings and be not deprived. Reflect upon the former ages and consider what befell the Prophets of God and His Messengers. Whenever the Dawning-Place of divine revelation appeared from the heaven of God's Will, all arose in opposition and protest, and inflicted upon that Essence of being that which the pens of the world are powerless to recount. Say: O friends! The water of life floweth in the name of the Revealer of verses. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized and drunk thereof, and woe unto the heedless ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nIn the Name of Him Who is the Guardian over all who dwell on earth and in heaven!\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of those who dwell in the kingdom of creation, that perchance this remembrance may draw them nigh unto a station which hath been recorded in the Book. This is not the day for tarrying and silence. It behooveth every soul to speak with wisdom and utterance concerning this Cause which hath been made manifest from the horizon of grace. O loved ones of God and His chosen ones! Hearken unto the call from the direction of the luminous Spot. Verily, it giveth you glad tidings of that which hath been sent down in a Book inscribed by the Pen of God. Beware lest the doubts of men withhold you from the Truth. Forsake that which the people possess, then turn with radiant faces toward the horizon which was promised by the tongue of God. The proof hath been perfected, the bounty completed, and that which was hidden in the pavilion of glory hath been revealed. The heaven hath been cleft asunder, and the crimson Ark hath sailed upon the sea of grandeur by a command sent down from the heaven of Revelation. Thus hath the Tree spoken, the Cock crowed, and the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the branch known by the name of God. We counsel thee and the loved ones of God to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped. Verily, thy Lord is witness unto what I say.\n\nIndeed, the grace, favor, generosity and mercy of God have reached such a degree that none can adequately render thanks for them. Divine verses are being revealed night and day without cessation, and all are mirrors reflecting the bounty, generosity and loving-kindness of the Beloved of the worlds. This evanescent servant beseecheth God to aid His loved ones to perform such deeds as are worthy of this most exalted and most holy grace. Convey, on behalf of this evanescent one, sublime and glorious greetings to them who quaff the choice wine of inner meanings. Such blessing dependeth upon the favor of that Beloved One. God willing, may all drink cup after cup, draught after draught, and goblet after goblet from the choice wine of divine favor. Glory be upon thee and upon them, and upon everyone who hath spoken and doth speak, who hath stood and doth stand, and who hath walked and doth walk His straight path. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nFurthermore, some time ago wondrous and sublime Tablets were revealed specifically for the friends and loved ones in the land of K, and were sent with the Shaykh. Likewise, in these days several most holy and most exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for Aqa Muhammad Husayn N and his two namesakes and Aqa Ghulam-'Ali - upon them be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] - and were dispatched by post. God willing, may they attain unto them.\n\nAs for the Tablets that were previously requested for the friends in Qam?ar and its surroundings, which were delayed - this delay was due to the delay in your letter. Now certain Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of favor, both with and without names, and will be sent in the next dispatch, as sending them in this dispatch would be contrary to wisdom. After their arrival, permission is granted for you to write the name of whomsoever you deem advisable, that all may attain to divine favor. The Command is in His hand. He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whomsoever He willeth, and confirmeth what He desireth for whomsoever He purposeth. He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.\n\nSince only a bibliographic reference note appears to have been provided in Persian (which refers to an original tablet number), there is no actual text to translate. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.\n\n=== END BH00025 ===\n\n=== START BH00026 ===\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!\n\nThe Most Exalted Pen hath stirred and desireth to make mention of His loved ones who have turned towards the Dawning-Place of the Revelation of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, that the fragrant breezes of remembrance may draw them to the loftiest Summit and the ultimate Goal, and bring them nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nO people of God! There hath been sent unto you a Book inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Take hold of the Book with such steadfastness as shall not be prevented by the doubts of those who claim knowledge without clear proof or an enlightening Book. These are they who have violated God's Covenant and His Testament throughout ages and centuries, as doth testify the Source of mysteries from this glorious and impregnable station. They are those who denied God's favor after its revelation and pronounced judgment against Him Whom they were wont to remember night and day, at morn and at eventide.\n\nThe divines of various sects denied Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and the doctors of the Torah denied the Spirit when He came with manifest sovereignty. The Concourse on high and the dwellers of Paradise have lamented their oppression, were ye of them that know. Through them hath appeared sedition, and unto them hath it returned, yet most of the people are heedless. Observe, then remember when the Revealer of the Bayan came, how the divines turned away from Him, denied Him and His verses, until they pronounced judgment that His most pure and holy blood be shed. They awaited the days of God and His appearance, yet when the horizon of the heaven of Revelation shone forth and the One Who conversed on Sinai came, they unsheathed against Him the swords of hatred. Thus did their souls prompt them to that which kindled the flames of hell. Through their turning away, the princes and those who followed them in their deeds turned away. Verily, they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. They violated God's Covenant and His Testament, denied His right and cast His Book behind them. They are assuredly among the oppressors.\n\nO people of God! Hearken unto that which the Pen of God uttereth in this exalted station. Beware lest ye be hindered by the doubts of the divines, or the intimations of the mystics, or the might of princes. Turn with radiant faces and with supreme steadfastness, and take the cup of everlasting life from the hands of the favor of your Lord, the All-Glorious. Then drink thereof before the faces of men, once in My Name, and again in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Let not the clamor of the sects frighten you. The world and all that ye behold today shall perish, but the sovereignty and dominion shall remain with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the All-Knowing, and how many an unlettered one hath hastened and taken of My sealed wine and drunk in My Name, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, he is among those who are near unto Me in My mighty Book.\n\nO people of Dal and Ha! We have caused you to hear the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen. Hearken once again to the call of your Lord, the All-Glorious, from the divine Lote-Tree raised upon the luminous spot. Verily, He acquainteth you with the mystery of unity and guideth you to the straight path. We have appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in knowledge and treasured in the vaults of your Lord's protection, the Mighty, the Powerful. The pavilion of glory hath been raised upon the most exalted standard, and the banner of 'Verily He is God' hath been hoisted upon the most sublime station, yet most of the people are turning away. Say: If ye deny this Light and that which hath appeared from it, by what proof do your souls find tranquility? Bring it forth then, and be not of the patient ones. Say: This is the Day wherein nothing from among all things shall profit you. Fear ye the Lord of Names and be not among the abased ones. Observe, then remember what the hands of the people of the Bayan have wrought. They have written that which hath caused every faithful friend and trusted messenger to cry out.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! The Lord of all men hath come on the Day of the Appointed Time and calleth you unto God, the Master of the Day of Mutual Calling. Fear ye God and be not of the losers. Say: Cast aside your idle fancies and vain imaginings, turn ye unto God and then return unto Him. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Say: Do ye object to Him by Whose acceptance the Bayan was conditioned and God, the Mighty, the Beauteous, hath written? Say: The books of the world shall profit you not this day, nor what all peoples possess, except through this Book through whose revelation the denizens of the Kingdom have proclaimed: \"The sovereignty belongeth unto God, the command unto God, the greatness unto God, the Powerful, the All-Loving, the Gracious!\" Say: O people of the Assembly! Through you have the pillars of justice been shaken, equity hath grieved and the eyes of them that are nigh unto God have wept. Your tongues have uttered what the tongue of Nadr spoke before the face of the Messenger: \"O God! If this be the truth from Thee, then rain down stones upon us from heaven or bring upon us a grievous chastisement.\" Verily, My Most Exalted Pen lamenteth and saith: \"O people of Kaf and Ra, be fair in the Cause of God and in what hath appeared in this Revelation, and be not of them that turned away from the Truth when it came with manifest sovereignty.\" This is He Who arose in the earliest days before the faces of all men and summoned all unto God, the Goal of them that know, and concealed not Himself nor preserved Himself for less than a moment, whereunto every fair-minded and discerning one doth testify. Is he who hath manifested himself better, or he who remaineth behind the veil? Fear ye God and be not of the transgressors. Blessed is he who speaketh the truth, and woe unto every lying one who is moved by the winds of self and desire and is stirred however they wish. Thus doth the Wronged One recount unto you and counsel you as a token of His grace, and He is the All-Counseling, the All-Knowing. We mentioned you at the outset of the Book as a mercy from Our presence and a command from Us, and We are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed art thou, O My Name, for having entered the Spot of Paradise, the place whereon the lights of the Countenance have shone forth from the Dayspring of Beauty with a clear command, and for having attained the presence of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and for having heard the call of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. The breezes of revelation have wafted upon thee from the direction of inspiration from God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O Ancient Beauty! Give glad tidings unto him who standeth before the Throne of what hath been ordained for him by Thy Most Exalted Pen in a preserved Tablet. Say: Verily, thy arrival upon the shore of the Most Great Sea is better for thee than whatsoever hath been created on earth. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Take thy portion again and again from this surging sea and deprive not thyself of what hath been ordained for it by the Pen of the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Say: O party of God! Say \"In the Name of God\" and \"By God,\" then take a handful from the Water of Life and sprinkle it upon all created things, that they may be cleansed from the veils of humanity and be brought nigh unto the Most Sublime Vision, this hallowed and resplendent Station. Should thou find one who turneth toward thee, impart unto him the verses, then reveal unto him the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the ocean of thy Lord's mercy, the Mighty, the Wise. And shouldst thou see one who turneth away, turn thou away from him, placing thy trust in God, the Lord of all worlds. O party of God! Object ye not unto them that object unto you. Leave them to their idle talk, turning toward the Single One, the All-Knowing. Whosoever openeth his lips today in remembrance of this Most Great Remembrance, the Concourse on High shall circle round him with standards of light. Thus hath it been ordained from the presence of a Mighty, Ancient Ordainer.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan, know ye that behind the Mount of Power God hath men who aid Him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance in such wise that neither the might of the world nor the opposition of the nations can deter them. They testify to that which God Himself hath testified: \"There is none other God but I, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\" Blessed are they whom the clamor of the people hath not saddened in the path of God, the Lord of creation, nor have they been deterred by the censure of the censorious.\n\nO My Name! Give glad tidings to the loved ones concerning the Tablet of God and its influence. Verily, We have revealed for them that which giveth assurance to the hearts of the pure ones and causeth the hearts of the polytheists to quake. Say: O people! He hath come from the Supreme Horizon with God's momentous announcement, the Most High, the Most Great, and in His hand is a proof: weigh it in the balance of truth and by whatsoever proofs ye possess from the Prophets and Messengers. When it was made manifest, the proofs of the world bowed down before it. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Beware lest ye reject the truth by that which ye possess. Fear God and be not of the heedless. These are the verses of God sent down through grace, through which the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Fear the All-Merciful and be not of the transgressors.\n\nVerily, We have made manifest the Hidden Scroll, determined and sealed, which was inscribed by the Finger of Power and concealed behind the veils of the unseen - a bounty from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Nothing escapeth the knowledge of your Lord, nor doth any matter defeat Him. He hath manifested and caused to appear whatsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nSay: The Last Turn hath come, and We have stretched forth the Hand of Power and revealed from Our Most Great Mystery, concerning the pure truth, a mystery less than what can be counted. Thereupon did the dwellers of Sinai swoon away at the Dawning-Place of this crimson Sign upon the Spot of Sinai. Thus did the All-Merciful come upon the clouds of proof, and all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords!\"\n\nThose who dispute God's proof and His authority - these are they whom their desires have overcome and returned them to their abode in the fire - evil the abode of every denying infidel! Blessed is he who hath turned to the Supreme Horizon, clinging to His verses, holding fast to His robe, uttering His praise, and arising to serve His Cause whereby feet have slipped.\n\nWhen the Morn of Manifestation unfurled its standard and the Interlocutor of the Mount came with the banners of signs and the emblems of clear proofs, the people turned away and opposed Him with tyranny whereat the clouds cried out: \"Beware lest ye shut the door of bounty in your own faces. Fear God, O people of the Book! Beware lest ye do what the former party did on the day when the Rock cried out, the Great Cry was raised, and the mountains passed away.\"\n\nSay: Cast aside your vain imaginings. By God, they shall not profit you! He Who was established upon the Throne in the beginning of days hath testified to this. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the day wherein the scratching of the Supreme Pen was raised and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: \"Come ye, come ye, O people of the earth! This is the day wherein He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities hath been made manifest.\"\n\nWe counsel you with that wherewith We counseled Our loved ones aforetime: to be trustworthy, truthful, pure, chaste, loving and faithful. Leave what the people possess, taking what ye have been given from God, the Lord of all men.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Ali-Akbar, who believed in God on a day wherein hearts melted with the fear of God, the Lord of the Final End. We bear witness that thou didst turn and hear the Call and respond to thy Lord when the people of the cities and lands turned away. Turn with thy heart to the Most Exalted Horizon, then adorn thyself with the ornament of godliness and thy heart with trust in God, the Lord of humanity, and thy tongue with that which hath been sent down in the scriptures and tablets. Walk the path of divine good-pleasure with God's dignity and tranquility, that His signs may be manifested through thee in the world. This is what thou hast been commanded by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is the soul that hath been enkindled by the fire which the All-Merciful hath ignited in creation, from whose sighing is heard \"The Intended One hath come with a sovereignty that neither the ranks of the divines nor the hosts of princes could dismay.\" He calleth out with the most exalted call before all who are in earth and heaven: \"The Promise hath come, and this is what was recorded in the Book by the Pen of God, the Revealer of verses.\" Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by the Pen of Revelation when the Wronged One was in the hands of the wicked. Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and there shall endure for thee what hath been sent down from God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust.\n\nO Moses! Hear the Call from the Blessed, Eternal, Ancient Tree: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Cleaver of Dawn!\" The tale of the Mount and its Interlocutor hath returned, speaking in this Revelation: \"Verily, there is no God but I, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.\" The world hath been set ablaze by the fire of thy Lord's love, yet the people remain heedless and veiled. Say: By God! The Revealer of verses hath come with the standards of proof and utterance. Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and be not of those who awaited My days, yet when I manifested Myself, they denied Me. To this beareth witness the Mother Book. Thus hath the ocean revealed its waves and the light its radiance. Blessed is he who hath seen and turned towards it, and woe unto every denier and infidel. This is a day wherein the Point of the Bayan circleth round the throne of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and the Point of the Furqan giveth glad tidings to the world of the Lord of Eternity. The Spirit, in the wilderness of longing, saith: \"Here am I, here am I, O Desired One of the nations! Here am I, here am I, O Light of the horizons! Through Thee was manifested that which was hidden in knowledge and recorded in the books of God, the Lord of all men.\"\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! The Wronged One, Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with proof and testimony and hath summoned all unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, maketh mention of thee. He it is for Whose path the gems of existence have sacrificed their souls and all they possessed. Thus were hearts and souls attracted by the call of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nHearken unto the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen from the right hand of the luminous Spot, from the Divine Lote-Tree before the faces of all peoples. Verily there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have created ears to hearken unto My sweetest call, and eyes to behold the lights of the Countenance from the supreme horizon, and tongues to make mention of Me and praise Me in the kingdom of creation, and hands to grasp My Book and hold fast unto My mighty cord.\n\nThe world hath appeared for My Self, and the ocean of knowledge hath surged through My Name, and the sun of utterance hath shone forth through My mention, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: O concourse of the earth! Open your eyes, for We have adorned the heaven of utterance with the stars of certitude. Draw nigh with illumined hearts and radiant faces. By God! The ocean of knowledge hath surged before the world, and the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Wise, hath been wafted.\n\nThis is the Day whereon the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in the kingdom of utterance, and the horizon of the world hath been illumined by the Great Name, and all things have testified that, by God, the Day hath come and the people are in manifest doubt. Blessed is he who hath shattered the idols of vain imagination and hath arisen to serve God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below, with such steadfastness as neither the hosts and ranks could hinder, nor the battalions and legions could frighten. He spoke before all faces that which was a light unto the righteous and a fire unto the wicked. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Strong, the Powerful.\n\nGive thanks unto God for having made mention of thee in the prison and revealed for thee that which shall be a treasure for thee in His mighty and lofty Kingdom. Grieve not at anything. Convey the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance. This is what thou hast been commanded by the Omnipotent, the Ancient of Days. Thus hath the Treasury revealed its secrets and the Lote-Tree its fruits. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!\"\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! Hear the call from the supreme horizon from God, the Lord of Names. Verily there is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous. Blessed is he who hath testified to that which God hath testified, and hath acknowledged that which His Tongue hath acknowledged when He was seated upon the Throne and when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra and in this mighty Prison. Take hold of the Book of God with such strength from Him that the divines of the age shall not prevent thee. Be thou vocal in thy Master's praise and steadfast in service to His Cause. Verily He hath sent down for thee the proof and made clear His straight path.\n\nThis is a Day that cannot be equaled by centuries, and this is a Cause before which the hosts of the heavens and earth cannot stand. To this testifieth every truthful and perceiving one. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest the poor one hath sought the gate of Thy riches, and the sick one hath hastened to the ocean of Thy healing, and the wronged one hath desired Thy justice and favors. I beseech Thee by the lights of the morn of Thy manifestation and by the Word whereby the hearts of Thy chosen ones were attracted, that Thou deprive me not of the outpourings of Thy days and the breaths of Thy verses.\n\nO Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy supreme horizon and holding fast to Thy cord, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the hereafter and the first life. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which is with Thee and that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have not broken Thy covenant and Thy testament, who have hastened to the place of sacrifice out of longing to meet Thee, and who have offered up their spirits in Thy path. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by Thy Most Exalted Name, to forgive me and my parents and whosoever hath held fast to Thy cord and clung to the hem of Thy robe. O Lord! Thou art He through Whose generosity all creation hath testified, and through Whose bounty all beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! The grace of thy Lord God hath encompassed the horizons, yet most men do not understand. The hidden Cause of God and His treasured Secret have been made manifest, yet most of the people perceive it not. This is the Day wherein all things proclaim: O peoples of the earth! The horizon of the Revelation hath been illumined with the Light of the divine utterance, and the All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty. When the Promise came to pass and the Promised One appeared, the divines arose in opposition and perpetrated that which caused the denizens of Paradise and the Concourse on High to weep at eventide and at dawn. There hath befallen Us in God's path that which had never befallen anyone before. To this testifieth He Who in every state proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. O peoples of the earth! This is the Day of God, yet ye recognize it not, and this is the Day of divine utterance, yet ye remain silent. Remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\" This is the Day wherein We behold the people of the Bayan drunken, though they be not drunken, but severe indeed is the chastisement of God. This is the Day wherein thy Lord hath come and the verses have encompassed the Manifestations of Names and Attributes. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto them that have turned away. We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe what beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. The discourse of idle fancies hath returned, and most of the people are wandering distraught. O people! Fear God, and follow not the desires of every froward oppressor. This is the Day wherein that which was hidden from eyes and treasured in the knowledge of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised, hath been revealed.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Hearken unto the call from the right side of the vale, the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur did speak: \"The Kingdom is God's, the One, the All-Knowing!\" Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and We make mention of thee through this wondrous remembrance, at whose appearance the remembrances of the world did humble themselves and around which circled the Concourse on High, bearing the banners of verses. To this doth the Mother Book testify in this exalted station. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of utterance and art seized with the intoxication of the Salsabil of knowledge, say: \"My God, my God! Thy separation hath destroyed me, Thy remoteness hath consumed me, as have the tribulations that have befallen Thee in Thy path. My God, my God! Mine ear desireth to hear that for which it was created; withhold it not from Thy melodies and Thy call. My sight desireth to behold the effulgences of the lights of Thy most exalted horizon; deprive it not of that which Thou hast manifested for it. My God, my God! How is it that I hear the call of the servants but hear not Thy call, and see Thy creation but see not the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thy verses?\" Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of Thy garment and hath been seized by the breezes of Thy days, until he became detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, by the kingdom of Thy utterance, and by the ocean which the ships of the world cannot contain, and by the Ark which the waves of the malice of the nations cannot hinder, to strengthen me in all conditions as Thou didst strengthen me before and wilt strengthen me hereafter. Then send down from the heaven of Thy mercy upon Thy servants that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and acquaint them with what Thou hast intended for them through Thy bounty and grace, and guide them to Thy path which calleth out with the most exalted call in the morning and the evening: \"By God! I am the Straight Path and I am the Balance whereby all small and great are weighed.\" O Lord! Deprive not Thy servants of the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. Thou art He Who hath testified through Thy generosity to all created things and through Thy grace to all existing things. There is none other God but Thee, the Revealer of verses and the Lord of earth and heaven.\n\nWe have revealed for thee what We have revealed for none other of Our loved ones, as a grace from Our presence, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Say: \"My God, my God! If Thou shouldst prevent me from drawing nigh unto Thee and from standing before Thy throne and from presenting myself at the gate of Thy majesty, then inscribe for me, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, the reward of meeting Thee and of those who soared in the atmosphere of longing and yearning until they attained Thy presence and heard Thy sweetest call and beheld Thy most glorious horizon. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy imprisonment and Thy wrongs and what hath befallen Thee at the hands of Thy creation, not to disappoint me of what is with Thee nor to withhold from me that wherewith Thou didst quicken them that are in their graves. Thou art, verily, the Lord of the Manifestation, seated upon the throne on the Day of Resurrection. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nO Husayn! The Wronged One remembereth thee for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, even as He hath remembered the servants and called them to the most exalted horizon, the station wherein the Tree exclaimed: \"There is none other God but Me, the Lord of the exalted Throne!\" The All-Bountiful hath come in the final abode; among the people are those who denied Him, those who turned away, and those who manifested great tyranny. Say: O people of the earth! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with the kingdom of proof. Hasten, and be not of them that hesitate. Beware lest the cup of names prevent you from the Kawthar of eternity. Cast away what is with the people, holding fast to that which is with God, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: O people! Withhold not yourselves from the Dayspring of Revelation. By God, the verses have been sent down, the evidences have appeared, and the Sun of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof. Fear ye the All-Merciful and be not of them that are far removed. Come, come, O concourse of men, that I may show you the Most Great Vision and cause you to hear the call of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the ocean of knowledge manifested the waves of utterance and the heaven of inner meanings its stars. Blessed are they that attain!\n\nO My handmaiden! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison, when Mine enemies who denied the Resurrection and its signs, and the Hour and its tokens, encompassed Me. Verily, they are among the abased ones. Blessed is thy son who ascended unto God and partook of the Choice Sealed Wine when it was unsealed by the hand of power and might.\n\nO 'Ali-Rida! The Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens makes mention of thee. Verily, He came with the banners of verses and the standards of clear proofs on a Day wherein the pillars of existence were shaken through fear of God, the Lord of Lords. We bear witness that thou didst turn, believe, and respond to thy Lord when He came with power and sovereignty. Thou didst attain, before thy ascension, to the fragrance of the knowledge of thy Lord, and after it to the verses of God, the Lord of creation. Blessed is the soul that hath won mention by My Most Exalted Pen, and the face that hath turned unto the Countenance, and the heart that hath turned toward the horizon whence shone forth the Luminary of proof and evidence. O people of Baha! Take hold of the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him, and be not of them that disbelieved in God, the Lord of all mankind.\n\nO Siyyid Muhammad! Rejoice in the bounty of thy Lord. Verily, He maketh mention of thee from the direction of the Prison with verses that the centuries and ages cannot alter. Hearken, hearken! The Most Exalted Pen desireth to converse with thee. Behold, behold! The Ancient Countenance hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison. When thou hast heard and seen, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Illuminator of the horizons! The world hath been set ablaze by the verses of thy Lord, and utterance is filled with wondrous doubt. Behold the Most Exalted Horizon with thine eyes, then hearken unto its call with thine ears. This is what thou hast been commanded in the Scriptures and Tablets. Whoso regardeth it with other than His eye shall never know it. This is what God hath made specific to this Revelation, which when it appeared caused the limbs of all names to quake, the heavens to be cleft asunder, and the lands to lament. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee as a grace from Our presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO Siyyid Ja'far! The Greatest Scene hath been adorned and the Hidden Secret hath been revealed, and the Lord of Destiny calleth out, saying: O concourse of humanity! The Hour hath come and the moon hath been cleft asunder. Blessed is the servant who hath witnessed and attained, and woe unto every denying impostor. Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan prevent thee. Arise and say: O people, fear God and be not of the companions of error. Say: O party of God! This Day is your day. Remember your Lord, the Most Merciful, with wisdom and utterance, and follow not every polytheist who hath disbelieved in God, the Revealer of verses. This is a Day wherein the Way crieth out: Look ye, look ye, O people of Baha! By God, I was created for you, despite those who caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition. And the Guide crieth out and calleth: O party of God! God hath manifested me for you. Turn ye unto Him and be not of those who denied their Lord in the beginning and the end.\n\nO Mahmud! The Promised One maketh mention of thee from His glorious station and giveth thee glad tidings of God's tender care - thy Lord, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. Hold thou fast unto His grace, arise to serve His Cause, and voice His praise at eventide and at dawn. We have sent down the verses and revealed unto men that which draweth them nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon. Turn ye unto Him, O ye that are endowed with insight!\n\nKnow thou that the Concourse of the Bayan have denied this bounty the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. These have followed their desires and disbelieved in Him Who hath come from the Dayspring of Power with God's verses - the Omnipotent, the All-Choosing. Thus have their deeds been made to seem fair in their eyes, and they are this day numbered among the wayward before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Say: Fear ye God! He hath come with verses that all the books of the world cannot equal, as testifieth He in Whose grasp is the Kingdom of proof and evidence. Say: Come ye, that I may show you what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance and cause you to hear what the Dove of Paradise warbleth upon the loftiest branches. By God! What the people possess cannot this day compare with God's verses. Ponder ye, O men of understanding! By what proof can they who deny this Cause establish their claims? Say: Produce it, O sources of delusion!\n\nO Siyyid 'Ali-Akbar! He hath come from the heaven of Command bearing the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth.\" Doth it beseem anyone to turn away? Nay, by My Self that overshadoweth the earths and the heavens! That which was never manifested hath been made manifest, yet the people remain in strange delusion. They worship vain imaginings and comprehend not; they worship idols yet perceive not. They have adorned their heads with turbans - they are astray and lead others astray, yet they know not. They have lost who denied God's verses after their revelation and turned away from Him through Whom the letter K was conjoined with the letter N and every hidden matter was revealed. Thank thou God, thy Lord, that He hath aided thee to turn unto Him on a day wherein men have turned away from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nWe have desired to make mention of him who was named 'Ali-Akbar, who turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and traversed land and sea until he reached the shore of the Most Great Sea and heard the Call from the Dayspring of his Lord's utterance, the Lord of Names, and beheld what no eye hath beheld. We testify that he heard and turned and hastened until he entered the right Valley - the place wherein the fragrance of God, Lord of the seen and unseen, was diffused, and he testified to that whereunto God hath testified: that there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. He heard the rustling and the whispering and beheld the Most Great Sign from the Divine Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and that which hearts and minds have never apprehended. He believed in God on a day wherein the divines of the earth and its doctors, and those who followed them without clear proof from God, the Mighty, the All-Loving, disbelieved. And We make mention of his son whom We named Badi', and his mother who heard and responded and took the cup of nearness and meeting, drinking therefrom in the name of her Lord, the Lord of existence. O Mother of Badi'! Grieve not at anything. We counsel thee to be patient and forbearing, even as We have counseled Our handmaidens before thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient, the All-Appreciating.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who was named Ja'far and remind him of the days of God, lest the doubts of those who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed prevent him. This is a day wherein none save He should be mentioned. Say: Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of the Bayan, and oppose not Him Who hath come from the heaven of proof with the standards of divine knowledge, would that ye might know!\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Slay Me not with the swords of rejection. By God, I was sleeping when the hand of your Lord, the All-Merciful's will awakened Me and commanded Me to raise My voice between earth and heaven. This is not of Mine own accord, could ye but know it. Were He to find anyone else speaking forth and standing up for this Cause, He would not have raised Me up nor caused Me to speak a word, nor would I have manifested Myself amongst these people. To this testifieth the Book whose verses have been inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The All-Chosen hath taken from My hands the reins of choice, and raised Me up as He pleased and caused Me to speak as He desired. He, verily, is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nO Pen! Blessed art thou for having rendered Me well-pleased with thee, for thou hast spoken in such wise concerning the stations of the servants. We beseech God to reward thee with the most excellent reward and to strengthen His loved ones to remain steadfast in this irrevocable Cause.\n\nO Siyyid Husayn! There hath befallen Me in God's path that which hath caused the Concourse on High to lament, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, and those who circle round God's Throne, the Lord of the Kingdom. O peoples of the earth! Fear God and deny not Him through Whom God's Cause was manifested from the Beginning that hath no beginning, through Whom every Messenger was sent and every Book was revealed. He hath spoken: \"There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! We bid thee be silent, for the people of the Bayan are within thy hearing, that they might hear that wherewith they object to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We stood before all faces in days wherein skins trembled from the might of princes and divines. Then, when the waves of hatred subsided, there arose from behind the veil the buzzing of flies, and they committed what none before them had committed. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mightest thank thy Lord, the Sovereign of all sovereigns. Beware lest anything whatsoever prevent thee from the Lord of all names. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to that which thou hast been commanded by God, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Kindly.\n\nO Ali! The Wronged One makes mention of thee and remindeth thee of the verses of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. My Name, upon Him be My glory, was presented with a letter bearing thy name. We make mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison, that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that render thanks. This is the Day wherein the ocean of divine knowledge hath surged and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted. Blessed is he who hath seen and found; woe unto the heedless ones. O Ali! Remember Ali who advanced to the place of sacrifice in the Land of Ta, and offered up his spirit in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. How many a sacrifice hath offered up his life in My path, and how many a learned one hath given his soul for My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: O people of the Bayan! Leave Me to deal with the people of the Furqan. They have surrounded Me. Fear God, and be not of the wrong-doers. Say: Can that which ye possess profit you after ye have accepted My Cause? Be fair, and be not of them that turn aside. All things have passed away, and this is the face of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How many a learned one hath turned away, and how many an unlettered one hath hastened, and drunk, and said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know Thee!\" Be thou in all conditions reliant upon God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. Say: My God, my God! Thou knowest what is with me, and I know not what is with Thee. I testify that the reins of knowledge are in Thy right hand, and understanding is within the grasp of Thy power. I beseech Thee by the Word whereby Thou hast subdued all who are in earth and heaven, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou, verily, art the Powerful, the Almighty. O Ali-Asghar! Observe, then reflect upon the world and what hath occurred therein. It will guide thee and lead thee to a station wherein thou wilt find thyself detached from all else save God and clinging to His sure cord. It showeth thee its passing, its extinction, its changes, and what hath transpired therein by the decree of the Mighty, the Powerful. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, firm in thy love, truthful in thy speech, fair in all matters, and trustworthy in financial affairs. Thus doth the Most Glorious Pen counsel thee from this most exalted station. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the All-Knowing. The clamor hath been raised throughout all regions, and that which We foretold you hath come to pass, when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq, and in the Land of Mystery, and in this mighty Prison. Nothing hath appeared from the Cause but that We had informed the people of it in the Book. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O people of Dal and Ha! We counsel you to act in accordance with that which hath been sent down from the Pen of the Command of your Lord, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Great. Thus hath the sun of knowledge shone forth from the horizon of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Give thanks and say: \"Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!\"\n\nO Hasan! We bear witness that he who hath turned and hearkened is assuredly among the sincere ones in a perspicuous Book. The beginning of all things is the knowledge of God, and its end is steadfast adherence to whatsoever hath been sent down from the heaven of His Will that overshadoweth all who are in the heavens and on the earth. Whoso hath on this day quaffed the sealed wine of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, he verily is of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And whoso hath turned away from this Cause, he is assuredly among the companions of the Fire. Say: O people of the Bayan! Were the matter in My hands, I would not have revealed Myself. Fear ye God and oppose not Him Who hath come with what ye possess of the tokens of the Messengers. I was seated when your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, raised Me up; I was silent when He caused Me to speak through His firm and irrevocable command; I was asleep when He awakened Me and revealed unto Me that which no reckoner, however learned, can reckon. Say: Read ye what hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen and what ye possess, then judge with fairness and be not of the transgressors. I bewail My grief and sorrow unto God. O my Lord! Pour forth upon Me patience and make Me victorious over the wrongdoing people.\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with a company from the Supreme Concourse. Blessed is he who hath advanced, and woe unto them that have turned aside. Through Him hath the pavilion of glory been raised up, and the Trumpet hath been sounded, and all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save them who have come unto the All-Merciful with illumined hearts. By God's life! Were anyone to become aware of what hath befallen Me in the path of God, he would lament with the lamentation of the bereaved ones. The people of the Bayan have denied the proof of God and His testimony, save them who have perceived the sweet savors of Revelation and have testified to that whereunto God hath testified: that there is none other God but I, the Forgiving, the Generous. We have heard thy call and have answered thee with verses that all thou beholdest today cannot equal. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this great bounty. This is a day wherein that which lay hidden in the knowledge of God and treasured within the hearts of them who are nigh unto Him hath been made manifest. Say: This is God's Book speaking in your midst; hearken ye thereunto and be not of the heedless ones. God hath revealed Himself through His Name, the All-Merciful, unto all who are in the realm of possibility. Among the people are those who have advanced and attained, those who have turned aside, and those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. God hath men behind the Throne who aid Him with the hosts of utterance and exposition. They, verily, are among those who are brought nigh in a clear Book. Neither the doubts of the worshippers of names nor the veils of the transgressors can hinder them.\n\nO Qasim! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He counseleth thee with that which shall cause the Cause of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne, to be exalted. They who have taken their vain imaginings as lords besides God, these are the companions of the fire in the Book of God. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto the deniers. When thou hast gained access to My letter and discovered the fragrance of Mine utterance, say: My God, my God! I testify that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to enter the precincts of Thy glory, to stand before Thy gate and to appear in Thy presence. O my Lord! Prevent not mine ear from hearkening to Thy call, nor mine eyes from beholding the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause, the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Source of Thy commandments. O my Lord! Thou beholdest the tears of them that are nigh unto Thee in their separation from Thee, and the sighs of the sincere ones in their remoteness from Thee. Have mercy upon Thy servants and Thy creation, and withhold them not from that for which Thou didst create them. Thou, verily, art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. O my Lord! My heart hath melted by reason of the length of days of separation from Thee. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation, the mysteries of Thy Book, the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the effulgences of the lights of the Orb of Thy manifestation, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. If Thou deniest me, O my God, that which I desire through Thine irrevocable decree, then write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of attaining Thy presence. Verily, Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, nor can any name among all names hinder Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty.\n\nO Muhammad-Baqir! We have seen thy name and have made mention of thee in this wondrous remembrance, that this remembrance may render thee steadfast and firm in such wise that neither doubts may cause thee to slip, nor intimations prevent thee, nor the power of the world weaken thee, nor the might of the nations frighten thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. By God! The pens have been humbled when the Most Exalted Pen was set in motion, yet the people understand not. They have turned unto the daysprings of idle fancies, turning away from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The verses pass them by at all times, yet they turn aside therefrom. They worship idols and perceive it not, and they say that which the ancients never said. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses, the heaven of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy generosity, to aid me in that whereby the sincere ones may inhale the fragrance of steadfastness in Thy Cause. O my Lord! Make me not deprived of the breezes of Thy days, nor prevented from hearkening unto Thy verses. Ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the world to come and of this world. O my Lord! I testify that I am neither worthy of the wonders of Thy grace nor deserving of that which Thou hast sent down unto me from the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the ships of Thy power and the oceans of Thy might - they whom neither the might of kings hath prevented from drawing nigh unto Thee, nor the power of monarchs from gazing toward Thy horizon - O my Lord! to ordain for me that which beseemeth Thy generosity and grace. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Kind.\n\nO Abdul-Rahim! The wolves and evil ones of the earth have encompassed the Wronged One. They have denied Him after He came with verses that all the books of the world and whatsoever the nations possess cannot equal, and with a proof whereby the horizons of meanings and utterance were illumined. Blessed is the soul that hath testified to that whereunto the Most Exalted Pen hath testified. Woe unto every heedless one who hath disputed the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. How many a learned one hath been prevented by his learning from the Known One, and how many an ignorant one hath quaffed the wine of reunion from the cup of the bounty of his Lord, the Possessor of the seen and unseen. We counsel all with wisdom, even as We counseled the servants aforetime, and I am the All-Knowing Counselor.\n\nO CONCOURSE of the Bayan! Stretch forth your hands in supplication, for the Most Great Ocean is moved to cast upon you the pearls of wisdom and utterance. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is he who hath been illumined by the lights of the Kingdom and by that which hath been cast upon him from this Great Announcement - that which hath been mentioned at one time as the Ocean, at another as the Most Exalted Pen, and yet at another as the Speaker of Sinai and the Divine Lote-Tree in the Crimson Tablet, and as the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. They that have turned away, these have no portion in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nO Zaynu'l-'Abidin! My Pen lamenteth and recounteth what hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors. Verily, he whom We sheltered for successive years beneath the wing of grace hath risen in opposition and committed that which hath caused the eyes of the knowing to weep. By God's life! He hath drawn against My face the sword of denial, having been led astray by one of My servants, then raised his own voice in protest - to this every truthful and trustworthy one beareth witness.\n\nO Concourse of the Bayan! Judge fairly, by God: who is it that hath raised up the Cause and protected him whom ye had taken as a friend unto yourselves? Fear God, and be not of them that deny. We protected him from the sun's heat and winter's cold; yet when he felt secure, he sought to shed My blood - thus did his soul entice him, and he became one of the transgressors. We have endured in God's path that which hath melted the hearts of the sincere. My kinsmen and friends denied Me through the tyranny of princes and divines, until they drove Us from the Land of ?a to Zawra, thence to the Land of Mystery, and thence to this Most Great Prison, wherein hath been kindled the fire of hatred, which no eloquent tongue or swift pen can describe.\n\nO Husayn! Accept what is good as a command from God, the Lord of all worlds. Adorn thy head with the crown of trustworthiness and thy temple with the fear of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Forget not God's favor - He hath manifested the Dawning-Place of His signs and aided thee to recognize Him on a day when lamentation arose between earth and heaven through the deeds of the heedless. We counsel thee and them that have believed to preserve that which ye have been given by God, the Goal of them that know. How many a king hath been deprived of recognition, and how many a bondsman hath attained to his Lord's grace! How many a seeing one hath been forbidden to behold, and how many a blind one hath seen and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who didst remember me when I was in the hands of the oppressors!\" How many a mighty one hath been weakened by the power of the Manifestation, and how many a weak one hath scattered the hosts of vain imaginings in his Lord's name, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful! Thus have We caused the weak to inherit what belonged to the strong - a command from Us, for verily We are powerful to do this.\n\nWhen thou hearest the Call, turn with thy heart to the Most Sublime Horizon and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, for having aided me, made me know Thee, and guided me to Thy straight path. I testify that the Path is Thy path, the Manifestation Thy Manifestation, and the Command Thy Command, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\"\n\nO Muhammad-Qablih-Ja! The Dawning-Place of verses makes mention of thee, that perchance the people may discover the fragrance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, on a Day whereon the Herald proclaimed: \"The Kingdom is God's, the One, the All-Forgiving!\" We make mention of thee for the sake of God, that He may cause thee to be steadfast upon the straight path. Be detached from all else save Him, fixing thy gaze upon His horizon, and voicing His praise by night and by day. That which the people possess will profit you not this Day. Cast it aside at My bidding and take hold of that which ye are commanded by God, the Lord of Lords. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and follow not idle fancies and vain imaginings. Follow Him through Whose Name the Standard of the Cause was hoisted upon the most exalted station. Say: Have mercy upon yourselves and upon Him through Whom the Most Great Luminary shone forth from the horizon of the world, and through Whom the All-Merciful came with power and sovereignty. Were it not for the Glory of God, who would have raised up the Cause? Be fair-minded and be not of those who denied the Proof and the Testament. Thou didst stand before all faces, extolling the praise of God, the Lord of all mankind. But when the Cause was elevated, clamor arose in the cities and lands. Thus was the matter decreed, while the people remained in wondrous doubt.\n\nO son of the Emigrant! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord which is raised from the precincts of the Prison, summoning all unto the Dayspring of verses. This is a Book from Us to all who dwell on earth, that it may draw them to the horizon whence the lights have shone forth, and remind them of that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. That whereof We informed the servants aforetime hath come to pass, when Zawra became the seat of the Throne, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO peoples of the earth! Be fair in this Cause through which the Dove of Paradise warbled upon the highest branches. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Chosen. Through Him the path of God was made manifest in the world and the decree of the Balance came forth. This is a Day wherein the hidden Treasure hath appeared and the mountains have passed away like clouds. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the ornament of justice; woe unto every oppressive infidel! O Supreme Pen! Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and be not of the companions of error. Weigh what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance with the balance of justice and fairness. By God's life! I desired not to manifest Myself, nor to utter a word, but God's Will overcame Mine, and He manifested Me as He wished and desired. Through this there befell Me that which caused the Supreme Paradise to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. Verily, he whom We reared up sought to shed My blood. When the Cause was made manifest, he raised an outcry within himself, clinging to calumnies that have no standing with God, the Lord of all men.\n\nO Mirza! The Lord of Names makes mention of thee from this Spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of His remembrance. My Most Exalted Pen lamenteth and weepeth by reason of what hath befallen Me at the hands of those who have denied the Beginning and the End. They make mention of the Point of the Bayan, yet pronounce judgement against Him Who sent Him. They recite the verses, yet deny their Revealer. Take heed, O ye who are endued with insight! They behold God's bounty, yet deny it; they hear God's verses, yet turn away from them. These are assuredly the companions of the fire. O peoples of the earth! By God, We have come only to purify your souls from rancor and hatred. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book. The ocean of utterance hath surged and the fragrances of the All-Merciful have wafted. Turn ye, O people, with radiant faces toward the horizon wherefrom the regions have been illumined. Thus have We adorned the pages of the Book of Revelation with mention of Him Who conversed with the One Who conversed with the Fire. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every doubting ignorant one. O servants of the All-Merciful! When a clamorer cometh unto you, leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the Source of inspiration. Oppose not any soul; if ye detect from anyone the fragrance of animosity, leave him to his devices, clinging to the hem of the robe of your Lord's loving-kindness, the Cleaver of the dawn. The qualities that befit man are love, trustworthiness, forgiveness and faithfulness, and that whereby his being may be sanctified amidst all peoples.\n\nO son of the cotton-carder! He Who was rejected by the servants maketh mention of thee, after having come from the Dayspring of the Cause with a proof before which the proofs of those who clung to their vain imaginings and idle fancies were brought low. O son of the cotton-carder! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised in truth - verily it guideth thee unto the straight path and casteth upon all who dwell on earth the Word of God, the Lord of what is and what hath been.\n\nO people of the Bayan! By God, I was sleeping when the Will of God, the Revealer of verses, awakened Me, and I was silent when He made Me speak that which cannot be equalled by what the servants possess, and I was seated when He raised Me up through His power - and He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. If My transgression be My verses and My proofs, indeed the Point of the Bayan preceded Me, and before Him the Messengers of God, the Lord of the beginning and the return.\n\nO people of the Bayan! If the Point charged you to turn away, what have ye done to this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of justice? He charged you to turn towards it, yet ye arose to reject it. The clouds cried out because of it, and He commanded you to be submissive, yet ye advanced against it with spears and swords. O followers of error! Ye have turned away from Him at Whose recognition the Countenance of Knowledge smiled throughout all possibility. Say: Hear, for the sake of the All-Merciful, what the Point spoke in the Bayan: \"If ye help Him not, grieve Him not.\" Ye cast the Command of God behind your backs and committed that which caused hearts to melt. By God, the Bayan was revealed solely for My remembrance and gave glad tidings to the servants only of My Manifestation, whereby the lights have shone forth. By God, the Beloved was submissive to My remembrance, how much more to My Self! Be fair and be not of the unjust and tyrannical.\n\nSay: If ye be in doubt, read the verses of God and what ye possess, then judge fairly, O men of insight! By God, the Wronged One desired not your faith - He summoned you unto Himself for the sake of God, the Lord of all men. Behold, then remember when I stood before all faces on a day wherein souls were agitated and eyes were dazed. Verily He said: \"If He should come to you with a sign, oppose Him not,\" yet ye denied Him after He came to you with that which the Books and Tablets cannot rival.\n\nO people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and shed not the blood of Him Who aided you through the nights and days with the hosts of revelation and inspiration. When the Remembrance reached this point, I heard the lamentation of My Most Exalted Pen, whereby arose the wailing of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Crimson Ark, and the eyes of the righteous shed tears. By God, I heard the cry of the Point of the Bayan and His sorrow for My sake, and the outcry of the chosen ones in this grief whereby the Tree lamented and the pillars were shaken.\n\nO son of the cotton-carder! How many a learned one was barred from the Goal, and how many an unlettered one was seized by the wine of the Bayan, casting aside the world in his longing to attain the presence of God, the Revealer of verses. How many a scholar was kept back from the Most Great Ocean, and how many a cotton-carder hastened, and drank, and said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Dawning-place of bounty and grace!\"\n\nBlessed is he who hath attained to the remembrance of the Lord of the worlds in the Most Great Prison and hath testified to that which the All-Merciful hath testified in the most exalted station. Blessed is the name that hath attained to the movement of My Most Exalted Pen, and the stranger who hath sought his Most Glorious homeland, and the distant one who hath drawn nigh unto God, the Manifestor of clear tokens. Blessed is the knower who hath known the Known One, and the seeker who hath attained and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all religions!\" Blessed is he who hath drunk the Kawthar of immortality from the hand of bounty and bestowal, and he who hath inhaled and perceived the fragrance of the garment as it was wafted abroad through all regions. Blessed is the poor man who hath sought the ocean of wealth, and the sick who hath turned towards the Day-spring of healing, and the weak who hath drawn nigh unto the horizon of power. Blessed is the blood that hath been shed in My path, and the earth that hath been honored by My footsteps, and the breeze that hath wafted from the direction of My loving-kindness upon all who are in the lands. Blessed is the sea upon which sailed the Ark of My Cause, and the mountain whereon was raised the pavilion of My glory, and the face that hath been illumined by the light of My days. Blessed is the house wherein My remembrance hath been raised, and the atmosphere through which the fragrances of revelation have been diffused, both morn and eve. The world hath been illumined by the Luminary of the Most Great Name, yet the people remain heedless and astray. The locusts of hatred have spread abroad; thus hath the Most Exalted Pen informed you when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq. O people of the earth! Hear My call from around My throne, that it may draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of all men. He Who was created to serve Me hath denied Me - take heed, O ye who are endowed with insight! He whom I sheltered beneath the wing of grace for successive years hath sought to shed My blood. By God! The All-Merciful hath come with power and sovereignty. Say: O concourse of the earth! Is there any among you who can contend with the Knight of inner meanings in the arena of wisdom and utterance? Nay, by My Self, the True One! To this testifieth He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in the Book.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face toward Dal and Ha, then make mention of Ali-Rida, whose name was present before the Wronged One when He was in the hands of the wicked. We have seen thy remembrance and have remembered thee, that thou mayest rejoice and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear tokens. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen; woe unto every denier and infidel! When the promise came to pass and the Promised One appeared, the people rose against Him with such tyranny as the eye of creation had never beheld. Say: Die in your wrath! He hath come at Whose advent the world's foundations trembled and feet did slip, save those who broke not their covenant and followed that which God had revealed in the Book. Say: O people of the earth! None hath the right to test God, his Lord, or to try Him. Rather, it is His to test His servants. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. Cast away what ye possess and what the people possess. Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come with verses that have encompassed the cities. We have sent down for the people of Manshad that which will guide the fair-minded and direct them unto God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Whoso hath attained unto My good-pleasure this day, he is of the people of God in the Scriptures and Tablets. We desire naught from you. We remind you for the sake of God. Whoso believeth, it is for his own sake; whoso turneth away, verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O people of the earth! Hearken! By God, this is the call that was heard by the Beloved in His ascension, and by Moses on the Mount of Joy, and by the Spirit when He ascended unto God, the Revealer of laws and ordinances. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, while the people were in doubt and schism.\n\nO son of Abu-Talib! The Wronged One makes mention of those on earth in such wise as to remind them and draw them nigh unto the Dayspring of divine inspiration. The Wronged One hath come for the salvation of the world, yet the peoples have risen against Him with such tyranny as hath caused the horizons to darken. How many a night when sleep fled from Mine eyes, and how many a day when I lay in chains and fetters. They that dwell in the kingdom of creation and command have lamented My tribulations - to this testifieth every fair-minded one and every learned one whom knowledge hath not kept back from Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Pen! Announce unto the world this most great Revelation. Say: O people! Fear ye God and be not of them that have denied God's proof and testimony when He came with the kingdom of His signs. This is He of Whom Muhammad, the Apostle of God, gave you tidings. Fear God, O concourse of factions! This is He Whom ye have mentioned throughout centuries and ages. Through Him every doer of deeds drew strength, every distant one drew nigh, every lowly one was exalted, every speechless one spoke forth, and every seated one arose. The world hath been stirred with longing for His presence, yet most of the people remain heedless and in dissension. Read ye what ye possess and what hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, that ye may discover what hath been concealed from you. Verily, your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Husayn, whose name was present before the Wronged One, and We counsel him with that wherewith We have counseled most of the servants. I have come from the Dayspring of grace to reform the world. Blessed is he who hath testified to that whereunto God hath testified. Woe unto every denying deceiver. Blessed is he who hath quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the gracious hand of his Lord, the All-Merciful. Woe unto every one who hath turned aside and risen in opposition. I swear by God! I cannot recount what hath befallen Me at the hands of the wicked doers. O My Pen! Lament for My sake and for what hath befallen Me from the tyrants among My creatures, and say: My God, my God! I was sleeping, Thou didst awaken Me and raise Me up and cause Me to speak. Then Thou didst leave Me beneath the claws of hatred. Thou dost see and hear what hath befallen Me and what they have said concerning Me. By Thy might, O my God and O Thou Who art mentioned in my heart! Were all who dwell on earth and in heaven to unite to harm Baha, the mention of Thy praise would not cease to flow from His tongue, nor would He pause for less than a moment in revealing that which Thou hast commanded Him to reveal amongst Thy servants. By Thy grandeur and sovereignty! O Thou through Whose nearness the lands were stirred and through Whose separation hearts were melted! I would not exchange the abasement I have suffered in Thy path for the glory of the world, nor this weakness for the power of the nations, nor this poverty for the wealth of all who are on Thy earth. All that hath befallen Me in Thy love is the desire of My heart and the beloved of My soul. To this bear witness the dwellers in the cities of Thy justice and the sincere ones among Thy servants and Thy creation. O Lord! Thou knowest that I have desired naught save the freedom of Thy servants and their deliverance from the chains of idle fancy and vain imagining. Aid them, O my God, in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! How many a servant has been held back by the world, and how many a servant has rent asunder the veils, turning with devotion unto God, the Lord of all worlds! Be thou steadfast in the Cause and eloquent in proclaiming this momentous News. A leaf hath been presented before the Wronged One, adorned with the names of those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have sent down for each one that which will draw him nigh unto the All-Knowing, the One acquainted with all things. We counsel you once again to observe justice and equity and to preserve this Book that guideth you to the straight path of God. We make mention of those whose names were not presented in the prison, and give them the glad-tidings of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The beginning of all things is the recognition of God, and its end is steadfastness in His Cause. Thus hath it been ordained by the Powerful, the Ancient of Days. Say: O people of the Bayan! Your opposition cannot prevent the waves of the ocean nor the sun from its radiance. Observe, then be fair, and be not of the ignorant ones. God shall soon raise up men who will aid the Wronged One with wisdom and utterance. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the One acquainted with all things. And We make mention of My handmaidens in that land who have believed in God when He came with a wondrous Cause, who have attained unto His days, who have hearkened and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon when the heroes of the earth were in manifest doubt. He is with you under all conditions, hearing and seeing, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Rejoice in that your mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur while the Wronged One was in a mighty prison. We beseech God to assist you, to grant you success, and to ordain for you that which befitteth the heaven of His bounty and the ocean of His grace. He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful. We make mention of Abu'l-Husayn and counsel him with that which hath been sent down in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Take hold of the Book with the strength that cometh from Him - verily, He loveth them that act. It is permitted unto thee and unto those who have believed in that land to read that wherewith We have communed with God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne. He is the Rememberer and the Remembered.\n\nMy God, my God! Thy separation hath consumed me, Thy remoteness hath burned me, Thy distance hath melted me, Thy remembrance hath kindled me, and Thy call hath stirred me. By Thy might and Thy beauty! Were anyone to search the hearts of Thy lovers, they would find them pierced by the arrows of Thy separation, and their livers burned by the fire of being kept from Thee. O my Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy manifestation, yet know not which spot hath been illumined by the light of Thy knowledge, adorned with the splendors of Thy countenance, and honored by Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy beauty that shineth forth from Thy most exalted horizon, and by the mysteries of Thy knowledge, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, to ordain for Thy servants the privilege of attaining unto Thy presence and standing before the gate of Thy grandeur.\n\nO my Lord! I testify that Thou hast created ears to hearken unto Thy call in Thy Day, and eyes to behold the lights of the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, the Dayspring of Thy signs, and the Source of the manifestations of Thy power and favors. O my Lord! Deprive not the ears of that for which Thou didst create them, nor the eyes of that for which Thou didst fashion them. Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all created things and Whose grace hath encompassed all beings.\n\nO my Lord! The sweet fragrances of the garment of Thy Revelation have seized me, and the verses of Thy grandeur have so attracted me that I have forgotten myself and my own being and all that hath been created in Thy earth and heaven. Alas, alas! I know not by what deed I may stand before Thy face that might diffuse the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure. Nay, by Thy might! Thy grace hath encompassed me and Thy bounty hath emboldened me. This servant hath been assured of Thy grace and bounty, and of the acceptance of whatsoever hath proceeded from me in Thy days. By Thy might and majesty, Thy power and Thy beauty! I long to lay my face and my brow upon every spot of Thy earth, that perchance it might fall upon soil honored by the footsteps of Thy chosen ones and Thy messengers.\n\nI beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens, by the Daysprings of Thy power and might, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Then grant me that which is best in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Source of bounty, by Thy Most Great Signs and by Thy Most Great, Most Glorious Name, to make me one who circleth around Thy Throne and standeth before the gate of Thy grandeur in every world of Thy worlds. Then adorn my temple, my heart, and my breast with the lights of Thy knowledge and with the ornament of acceptance, through Thy bounty and generosity.\n\nO my Lord! This is a Day wherein the ocean of Thy bounty hath surged and the horizon of the world hath been illumined by the light of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which is with Thee, and to ordain for me that which beseemeth Thy mercy and Thy gifts, and which is worthy of Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nAnd may blessings and peace and glory and splendor rest upon Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones who have not broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and who have acted according to what they were bidden in Thy Manifest Book. These are servants who have cast aside all association with others, holding fast to the light of unity, through Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Most Great.\n\n=== END BH00026 ===\n\n=== START BH00027 ===\n\nJinab-i-Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.\n\nOn 6 Jumada'th-Thani 1304\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nPraise befitteth the Desired One, for Whom the clamor of the opposers, the uproar of the transgressors, and the might of the oppressors are but as the buzzing of a fly. The power of the world could not prevent His rising, nor could the might of nations hold back His call. Before the faces of all humanity did He raise His voice and summon all to the straight path and the mighty announcement. No harm could the raging winds inflict upon the pavilion of His will, nor could the storms of these days cause upheaval to the tabernacle of His purpose. Before the power of the Supreme Pen, the Manifestations of Names stand powerless. His Cause encompasses all, and His Word penetrates all. He is the sovereign Who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. He is the Generous One Whose tokens of generosity are manifest and evident from every direction. His mercy hath preceded all, and His bounty hath encompassed all being. He hath forbidden His servants from conflict and contention, from strife and combat, that the world might be illumined by the light of assurance, and mankind might repose upon the couch of peace and security, passing from tribulation to tranquility. In these stations and ranks there hath been revealed from the Pen of the Desired One of all worlds that which causeth the atoms of all created things to cry out \"May my life be sacrificed for Thee!\" Indeed, were one to navigate the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful, one would witness that which is today veiled from hearts and eyes. Verily, the ocean is great, great, and the Cause is great, great.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Master of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! Thou seest Thy servant who desireth to make mention of one of Thy loved ones who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause and hath traveled through the lands to exalt Thy Word, and who desired naught in his days save Thy remembrance and praise and the promotion of Thy Cause amongst Thy servants. O Lord! Aid him through Thy confirmations and assist him through Thy grace, then open before his face the doors of Thy bounty and mercy. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Beloved of my heart! The letter arrived, yet it was not a letter but a musk-laden fragrance of inner meanings, for from it wafted the sweet scent of the love of the Desired One of all worlds. It transformed sorrow into joy and grief into gladness. Well is it with the pen and utterance that have been dedicated to the mention and praise of the Beloved of all possibility. And since this evanescent one had not for a long time been blessed with the traces of that beloved heart's pen, this time it added to joy beyond the measure of understanding and intellect, and diminished grief. No word or expression comes to mind that could adequately convey the hidden meanings within the heart, unless boundless grace bestoweth success and His favor lendeth support. In any case, after boundless joy, we proceeded to the presence of the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. After gaining admittance and permission, the entire letter was presented and was honored to be heard. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke from the most exalted station - the Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nHe is the Hearer and I am the Answerer.\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the Most Great Word - that is, contentment - both before and after, and hast been illumined by the rays of the Sun of divine favor. By night thou speakest and by day thou makest mention, thy purpose being the exaltation of the Word of God and the promotion of His Cause. The Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken thus: All the pens of the world and tongues of nations are powerless to describe the station of this testimony. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nO thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! At all times the pearls of wisdom, knowledge, inner meanings and utterance have been manifest and visible from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen, yet the seeker is nowhere to be found and the discriminating one, like the phoenix, doth not exist. In the Hidden Words this passage was revealed from the Supreme Pen, addressing the divines of the age: \"O ye that are outwardly fair yet inwardly foul! Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun's rays fall alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ in their reflection as the star-studded heaven from earth - nay, immeasurable is the difference!\"\n\nO Haydar! Insight is rare and discrimination absent. Beseech God to grant the ears and eyes of His servants the power to perceive, that they may become worthy to behold and qualified to hear. This year thy mention hath repeatedly fallen from Our tongue, and each of the souls mentioned hath attained unto the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance. For each one hath been revealed that which hath no peer or likeness. By the life of God! They have attained unto an everlasting distinction and eternal remembrance. Beseech God that what He hath bestowed may be preserved and remain unaffected by the vicissitudes of the world and all that is therein.\n\nWhensoever thou meetest the people of God in any land, be it in cities or villages or on the highways, make mention of them on behalf of this Wronged One and remind them of the divine verses. Praise be to God that steadfast souls who are content and well-pleasing have attained unto the Most Great Favor and Supreme Gift. In accordance with wisdom, names have not been mentioned but are preserved in God's protected treasuries. Blessed is he whom the doubts and allusions of the world and the vain imaginings of the nations have not debarred from the lights of certitude.\n\nSay: O people of God! Know ye of a certainty that whatsoever hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Tablets shall come to pass and appear in the realm of manifestation. Know ye your station before God and be not heedless of remembrance, praise and service to the Cause. He is the Counselor, He is the All-Knowing, He is the All-Powerful. Were the people of the world to become aware of even less than a needle's eye of understanding, they would regard all else save God as non-existent and would hasten to the court of the Friend.\n\nBoundless grace and infinite favors - the Sun of generosity is shining and the Luminary of bounty is radiant. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, who hath turned away from the world's retreats, advancing toward the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. And blessed is he who hath held fast to the cord of his Lord's tender mercy, and woe unto him who hath turned away from God, the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former generations.\n\nThe glory shining and manifest from the horizon of the kingdom of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nThe fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance hath seized and attracted the realms of the seen and unseen, and every possessor of smell, sight and hearing hath attained supreme joy. Through His mention one becometh independent of all other mentions in the world, and through His grace, free and detached from all that the peoples possess. What can this servant say and what can he mention? That Beloved One, through His infinite bounty and supreme grace, hath with His own eyes beheld the Most Exalted Horizon and with His own ears hearkened unto the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen. How excellent is this most exalted station and this supreme rank! Consider the baseness and contemptibility of the servants: deprived and forbidden from the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, yet occupied with and delighting in the buzzing of flies. One is bewildered as to what they cling to and what hem they grasp. In any case, His mercy hath preceded all and the sun of His grace hath shone forth. This servant, that honored one, and the other loved ones must beseech and implore from the ocean of generosity that which will assist all and lead them to the horizon of revelation. In truth this servant is sorrowful, for he observeth that the days which were the hope of those near and sincere have appeared, yet the servants are heedless of them, occupied with nothing, and unaware.\n\nAssist, O my God, Thy servants, and deprive them not of the manifestations of Thy grace and the breathings of Thy days, and disappoint them not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and sincere ones. Verily Thou art the Most Generous of the generous, the Most Merciful of the merciful, and the Most Powerful of the powerful, and verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nAnd as for what thou didst write concerning M.Q., upon him be the glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith: O Haydar! Upon thee be the light of the luminary of My grace. We have ever made mention of him who is denoted by M and Q, upon him be My glory. The hand of grace took hold of him and the Pen of Destiny ordained for him manifest glory and beyond that. We hope that through God's grace he will remain steadfast and will not alter his ordained blessing. Convey My greetings unto him. We beseech God to assist him to be steadfast in His Cause, to aid him and reinforce him with the hosts of the seen and unseen, to manifest that which hath been written for him from the Most Exalted Pen, and to send down upon him a blessing from the heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nToday this blessed word was heard from the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing: O people of God! Be not grieved, soon that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken will appear in the world and ye shall witness God's power and His greatness, and God's revelation and His sovereignty. O Haydar! Convey greetings to the loved ones of God. In every place thou meetest them, make mention of them on behalf of the Wronged One and give them glad-tidings. As for the loved ones of A and B whom thou didst mention, each hath been blessed with the tokens of the Pen. There hath been sent down for them from the heaven of grace and bounty that which the pens of composition are powerless to describe. The names that were recorded in the leaf, each attained to that which hath no peer or likeness, and likewise the loved ones in the land of Sh. In truth they are gazing toward the horizon, arising to serve, holding fast to the cord, speaking in remembrance, and likewise the loved ones in other lands - all have attained, but We have preferred some above others as a command from Us, and I am the Ancient Commander.\n\nAs to the honored servant Mr. M.Q., upon him be the Glory of God, that which has been revealed from the Supreme Pen makes unnecessary any mention or description from this evanescent servant. And that statement which he wrote was quoting from the objectors among the people, for he says that since the Cause of these people has not yet been officially recognized by the government and religious leaders, they therefore oppose it. This being a quotation, divine forgiveness has encompassed it - if He wishes, He changes bad deeds into good ones. This matter was not considered among bad deeds from the beginning. Also convey greetings and salutations on my behalf and make mention of him. It is hoped that divine favors will encompass him. I have beseeched and continue to beseech from God confirmation, assistance, bounty and glory. Verily He has power over all things. All that your honor wrote regarding the levels of meeting and mentioning to each person, as well as the wisdoms mentioned, was entirely acceptable in His presence. Words must always be spoken in measure and revealed wisdom must be observed. It is hoped that all will follow your example. At this time, after attendance, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this supreme word: Write to J.H. that what you mentioned about dealing with people in measure and proportion - that it must be done in such a way as to increase friends and calm or draw near those who are not friends - this is a great and good word. One of those endowed with wisdom was Alexander. When asked how he conquered most regions in such a short time, he said that he preserved his friends and did not let them become enemies, and strived to make his enemies into friends. This word is acceptable. Blessed are they that act accordingly. And regarding what you wrote about the assured souls in A. and Y., upon them be the Glory of God, and their success - praise be to God their deeds have been accepted. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist them, confirm them, draw them near to Him, and ordain for them that which will bring joy to their eyes and gladden their hearts. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. And mention was made of Mirza Ahmad Kh., upon him be the Glory of God, and Muhammad Kh. and Aqa Mirza Abdul-Karim, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented in the Most Holy Court, this supreme word was manifested from the Dawning Place of Grandeur - the Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified: O Heydar A., the first name has been mentioned before the Wronged One in the past and present and has attained to grace, and at this time these verses have been revealed from the Dayspring of Names and Attributes that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. \\[...\\]\n\nHearken unto the call from this most exalted station, from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Him. His are the bounty and the giving, His are the grace and the glory. He hath come from the heaven of Command with the Kingdom of verses, and through Him hath been raised the banner of 'He doeth what He willeth' upon the highest standards. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, and hath spoken before the faces of all peoples. The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a grace from Him, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe have mentioned thee before, and at this hour with verses that all the treasures of earth cannot equal, whereof the Mother Book with Him doth testify. That which thou seest today shall pass away, but that which hath been sent down for thee from My Pen shall endure. When it moved, the limbs of all names trembled, and when its scratching was raised, the hearts of the learned were troubled, and the faces of those who denied the Beginning and the Return were darkened. They awaited the days of the Manifestation, but when the One Who conversed on Sinai came, they turned away, following suppositions and idle fancies.\n\nBlessed art thou for having turned towards the Wronged One and uttered His praise, when the transgressors who broke God's Covenant and His Testament turned away from Him, and denied Him Whose days they had awaited throughout centuries and ages. When the sweetness of My call and the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen enraptured thee, say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto Thy straight path and made known unto me Thy Great News which was recorded in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets by the Pen of Thy Command. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity, and by Thy Command through which Thou hast subdued the world, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the mysteries of Thy Book, to make me in all conditions one who speaks Thy praise and mention, who turns toward the horizon whence shineth the Sun of Thy Revelation, who stands firm in the service of Thy Cause, who holds fast to the cord of Thy grace and clings to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity. O Lord! Thou seest me gazing toward the direction of Thy grace, hoping for what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what is with Thee, nor to deny me from drawing nigh unto Thy threshold, nor to deprive me of the breathings of Thy days. I know not, O my God, what Thou hast ordained for me by Thy command. I beseech Thee by those who have arisen to exalt Thy Word, whom neither the influences of the pharaohs nor the might of the oppressors could deter from turning toward Thee and standing firm in Thy service, to ordain for me the reward of attaining Thy presence and standing before Thy face. Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the lights of Thy countenance, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful, and Thou art worthy to answer.\"\n\nPraise be to God, they have attained unto the Most Great Favor. This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist them and illuminate that lineage with His light. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Muhammad Khan, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the Witness, the All-Hearing.\n\nO Muhammad! He Who loveth Me and is loved by Me hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee from the Most Great Prison with a remembrance through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath perfumed all creation, that it may draw thee to a station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all men!\" Let not the happenings of the world grieve thee, nor the might of the wicked hinder thee. This is the Day wherein that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets hath been made manifest. Blessed is he who hath turned unto the Dayspring of Grace when every heedless doubter turned away. Be thou vocal in thy Lord's praise, steadfast in His Cause, and soaring in this atmosphere from whose rushing winds can be heard: \"There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\"\n\nHow many a prince hath this day been debarred from My sealed wine, and how many a pauper hath heard and hastened and taken and drunk, exclaiming: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Desire of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Lord of all mankind!\" How many a learned one hath been veiled from My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and how many an ignorant one hath turned and attained unto the knowledge of God, the Lord of lords!\n\nWhen thou hearest My call and perceivest the fragrance of Mine utterance, say: \"My God, my God! I testify that Thou didst create all things for Thy knowledge and Thy meeting, and didst show them Thy path and send down for them Thy proof. Yet when Thy testimony was fulfilled and Thy bounty perfected, they turned away from Thee and denied Thee and Thy signs, and disputed Thy proof, and committed that which caused the dwellers of Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm to lament. Alas, alas! O my Lord, my Support, and my Goal! I know not what thing hath kept me from drawing nigh unto Thy most exalted horizon and standing before Thy face, O Lord of all men! I testify that Thou knowest what is within me, while I know not what is within Thee. Ordain for me from the wonders of Thy bounty that which will make me among those whom the affairs of men have not kept back from Thy Greatest Prospect, who have turned with radiant faces and illumined breasts unto Thy most exalted horizon. O Lord! Thou seest me awaiting the manifestations of Thy grace and that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bestowal. By Thy might, O Possessor of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! My heart findeth no rest save in Thy remembrance and praise and service and obedience. I beseech Thee to aid me to act according to what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book and to arise to serve Thee and Thy loved ones. Then I beseech Thee, O Thou Who answereth the distressed and art the Ultimate Goal of the sincere, by Thy Name through which the hearts of those near unto Thee have soared, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Thou art He through Whose power all things have testified and through Whose might all possibilities have been proven. No force in the world can weaken Thee, nor can the hosts of nations render Thee powerless. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou willest. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Furthermore, I beseech Thee to forgive me and to send down upon me from the clouds of the heaven of Thy mercy that which shall make me rich through Thy riches, detached from all else save Thee, and steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThis is what was revealed for His Honor Mirza Abdul-Karim, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God:\n\nHe is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon.\n\nO thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Give thanks for the Most High Pen hath called thee from the most exalted horizon and commandeth thee to that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee, and unto Thee be grace and bounty, for having shown me Thy signs, caused me to hear the scratching of Thy Pen, guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty message, made me speak Thy praise, acquainted me with Thy station, and revealed unto me Thy verses. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and the manifestations of Thy power in Thy dominion to make me in all conditions severed from aught else save Thee and holding fast unto the cord of Thy grace. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have acknowledged that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken before the creation of Thy heaven and earth - that Thou art God, no God is there but Thee. Within Thy grasp are the reins of the kingdom and the realm, and in Thy right hand are the reins of might and power. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. None can resist Thy command, none can frustrate Thy wisdom. Every discerning one hath testified to Thy oneness and singleness, and every informed one to Thy greatness and power. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations, by the lights of Thy countenance and the traces of Thy Pen, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all Thy worlds. O Lord! Disappoint not him who hath turned to the ocean of Thy bounty, and deny not him who hath answered Thy call when it was raised between Thy heaven and earth. Decree for me what I desire from the sun of Thy bestowal and the horizon of Thy grace. Then forgive me and those who have recognized Thee and inhaled the fragrances of Thy days. Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and Whose power is not frustrated by the clamor of the servants who have risen in opposition. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Generous. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.\n\nWe wish to mention at the end of this Tablet thy companion who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Praised. She heard and responded and turned towards Him on a day wherein every learned one was remote and every knower was in doubt.\n\nO My leaf and My handmaiden! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison quarter and giveth thee glad tidings of the favors of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great. Blessed is the handmaiden whom vain desires have not kept back from the Lord of all creation. She hath testified to that which God hath testified: that there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say:\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me in Thy prison and made me a leaf among the leaves of Thy divine Tree. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Cause and the potency of Thy Will, and by those who circle round the Throne at eventide and dawn and hear Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and speaking Thy praise among Thy handmaidens. There is no God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nAs regards what was written about the honored leaf, the mother of Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Rida, upon them both be the glory of God - after it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, a blessed Tablet descended from the heaven of Will specifically for them and their mother. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm them that they may receive their full portion from the effulgent lights of the Luminary of proof and from the waves of the ocean of the utterance of Him Who is the Desire of all worlds. How wonderful! The fragrance of divine favor hath encompassed the world. Man is bewildered, the tongue is bewildered, the pen is bewildered, understanding is bewildered - what to mention and what to express! Our mentions and sounds are like a dried leaf which the wind moveth and from which a sound is heard. How then can this dried leaf be capable of mentioning the tree and its fruits and leaves and branches and what hath been ordained therein? Verily, powerlessness is a good wing and a good cord whereby we may soar and whereby we may hold fast, inasmuch as He hath loved and loveth the powerlessness of His servants. Were the people of the earth to discover less than a needle's eye of the sweetness of powerlessness before that Presence, they would desire and seek none other than Him. He Who possesseth the perspicuous Book beareth witness unto this.\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith:\n\nHe is the One dawning from the horizon of Revelation\n\nO 'Ali-before-Rida! The Speaker of Sinai is established upon the throne of Revelation and, without any veil or barrier, hath summoned and continueth to summon all the peoples of the world - be they divines, jurists, princes, kings or sovereigns - to the straight path and the mighty announcement. Neither the fire of rancor and hatred and the clamor of the divines, nor the might of princes hath deterred Him. The power of the Most Exalted Word is evident and manifest like unto the sun. The purpose is that the horizons of the world may be illumined with the light of unity and be adorned with reformation, and that they may likewise discover for what purpose they have been brought from nothingness into being. However, the conjectures and idle fancies of the divines of the age have debarred the servants from the divine Egypt and deprived them of the light of certitude. Blessed is the servant whom the vicissitudes of time have not withheld from the Luminary of proof.\n\nThe leaf, the mother, hath been mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence and hath attained unto His grace. O My leaf and My handmaiden! Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One Who addresseth thee from the direction of the Prison, saying: The eyes of the world and the ears of the nations were created to behold and hearken in these days. However, veils have prevented most from beholding and hearkening - and this veil is the most great veil, meaning the divines of the earth.\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to turn towards Thy most exalted horizon when the divines of Thy earth turned away from it, O Lord of all beings, and for having assisted me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens, and the Source of Thy revelation and inspiration, Who was mentioned and recorded in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Thou seest Thy handmaiden turning toward the horizon of Thy Revelation and Thy leaf holding fast to the Tree of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee to assist me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to cling to the hem of Thy wisdom. Then ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nPraise be to God! The rain of bounty pours down continuously from the heaven of grace. At every moment a blessing appears and at every instant a heavenly table is made manifest. Who is capable of offering thanks for this station, and what tongue is worthy unless His grace takes hold of it and His generosity accepts it? Likewise mention hath been made of Muhammad-Qasim Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, through Shaykh Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, who hath mentioned him, and he hath also sent a petition to the Most Holy Court. Now, after his name was presented before the Presence, one Most Mighty, Most Holy Tablet was revealed especially for him. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist him and to adorn him with that which befitteth His days.\n\nThe Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaketh:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Encompassing above all names!\n\nO Muhammad-Qasim! Upon thee be My Glory! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One with such attention as will aid thee to perform that which beseemeth the Day of God. Know thou the value of these days. Neither the sun nor the moon hath witnessed the like of this Day. This is that Day which hath been mentioned in the divine Books of the past and of the future. Today the ocean of grace is surging, the river of mercy is flowing, and the Sun of Truth is shining. We beseech God to illumine thee with the effulgences of the Day-Star of Revelation and to set thee ablaze with the fire of the Blessed Tree - a blaze whose effects shall become manifest. For this is the Day of deeds, not words. One pure deed soareth beyond the heavens and transcendeth them. We beseech God to assist thee in such wise that the fleeting occurrences of the world and its transient riches and pleasures may not withhold thee from its everlasting bounties.\n\nHaydar hath mentioned thee, and previously we heard thy call through the Arab and made mention of thee. The people of God who have quaffed the choice sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting must arise to mention, praise, and serve the Cause. The hosts of victory and triumph have ever been and shall ever be goodly character and pure and holy deeds. Say: O people of God! Fear God! Fear God! All must be adorned with the ornament of love, kindness, faithfulness and trustworthiness. Whosoever attaineth unto these attributes, his words will have influence, his deeds will have influence, and his mention will have influence. The Divine Lote-Tree of the most exalted Paradise now speaketh this most sublime word: \"Whoso turneth to God, verily God turneth unto him.\" The glances of grace have ever been and shall ever be directed towards His loved ones. Blessed are they who have clung to deeds. They are indeed of the people of Baha in the Tablet of God, the Lord of all beings, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. He Who speaketh in every state beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe make mention of all thy relatives and convey Our greetings. Each one is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and hath attained the grace of God, exalted be His glory. Say: Know ye the value of these days and recognize your station. In the nights and days occupy yourselves with the praise and glorification of the Goal of all creation. By the Sun of utterance which shineth from the highest horizon of possibility! All that is visible shall soon perish, and that which endureth and lasteth forever is but a word that floweth from the Most Exalted Pen. This is the most great bounty, the eternal wealth, the everlasting riches, and the perpetual grace. Blessed is the one who hath recognized the station of this Day and hath detached himself from all else. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned unto God and responded when the Call was raised from the most sublime horizon, and who have attained the recognition of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe fragrance of divine counsel has permeated the cities of hearts and minds of the just and fair-minded. The discerning soul observes that from the Word of divine counsel, upon every atom of atoms a pulpit is erected and a counselor is engaged in counsel thereon. If you find and see any ear that is empty, inform Us. God forbid! God forbid! We are not discouraged, for once this exalted Word flowed from the tongue of the Lord of creation: \"O servant in attendance! Be not discouraged. The utterance of the All-Merciful shall bestow ears and impart understanding. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.\"\n\nMention was made of his honor Haji, namesake of the Most Great Name, and likewise a request was recorded for his forgiveness, pardon, confirmation, blessing and steadfastness. After these matters were presented at the Most Holy Court, this blessed Tablet was revealed from the heaven of will. His word, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful\n\nUnceasingly have the evidences of grace, mercy, compassion and loving-kindness appeared and been manifest from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen. Every word of the exalted utterances that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the Will of the Lord of Names is a perspicuous book, a wise command and a momentous tiding. Blessed are they who have attained unto its recognition and received their portion from the ocean of its meanings. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have heard thy call and We answer thee with this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet. The word of forgiveness and pardon hath been revealed by the Most Exalted Pen concerning thee. Give thanks unto the Lord of all worlds that thou hast attained unto this most great favor and supreme mercy. The keys to the treasures of the world are in the grasp of His power. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. That from which the fragrance of favor wafteth hath been ordained for thee. Say:\n\nO my God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have turned unto Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the breezes of the dawn of Thy Manifestation and by the places which were honored by Thy footsteps and which Thou didst make the seat of Thy throne, that Thou forgive me and make me of those who have been so attracted by the wine of Thy revelation and inspiration that nothing whatsoever hath deterred them from drawing nigh unto Thy most exalted horizon and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all being! O my Lord! Thou seest this servant of Thine who seeketh forgiveness from the ocean of Thy mercy, blessing from the heaven of Thy bounty, and steadfastness from the sun of Thy loving-kindness. Ordain for me, O my God, the good of the hereafter and the present, and that which shall be a light unto me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art He at Whose gifts and bounties all things have proclaimed their praise. Then I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and the unseen, to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Every letter of the divine words calls out and proclaims \"To Me! To Me!\" In truth, it bestows new life upon the world. Would that the people of the world would discover and comprehend this, that they might attain the fruits of their being and be freed and delivered from the dust and smoke of the earthly realm. Verily, He is powerful over all things. This servant recalls the days of nearness and meeting. Their renowned one is present in this land, and from this very circumstance there is hope that they may succeed in achieving true freedom - that is, to dedicate themselves to the service of the Cause, so that there may be uttered by their tongues that which is mentioned in the divine realms, and its radiance may shine forth and its light become manifest. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Almighty, and worthy to answer prayers. I convey greetings and praise to them, and at all times I seek confirmation and success.\n\nLikewise mention was made of the handmaiden of God, the wife of Mashhadi Abu'l-Qasim, upon them both be 95 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], and supplication was made for her forgiveness and for bounties for her children. These verses were honored to be heard by the Lord of Names, and after being heard, the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness wafted. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks:\n\nIn My Name, the Forgiving, the Kind, the Merciful\n\nO Haydar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The servant present mentioned thy letter before the Divine Presence. We heard it and answered every passage thereof. Ever has thy mention been before the Most Holy Court, and the gaze of favor has been directed towards those mentioned in thy letter, including the mention of the handmaiden of God, the wife of Abu'l-Qasim. We have indeed forgiven her as a bounty from Us, pardoned her, and purified her with the water of My mercy which has preceded all things. We beseech God to ordain for her what He has ordained for His handmaidens who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn.\n\nWe make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan and he who was named 'Ali, and We command them to patience and steadfastness and to that which was revealed in My Perspicuous Book. We ask God to ordain for them that which will profit them and draw them near unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Indeed they have attained the trace of My Most Exalted Pen while the Most Great News was in His mighty prison. Remember them with My loving-kindness, remind them of My verses, and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy which has preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Thus has the ocean of utterance surged when the Beauty of the All-Merciful walks in His exalted station. That which was sent from My handmaiden has been accepted. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. It is ended.\n\nThis servant also specifically supplicates for forgiveness for the handmaiden of God, upon her be the Glory of God, and praise be to God, it has been answered. And specifically for the Trustee, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm them and protect them from the croaking of those who turn away from the Bayan. He is the Protector, the Helper, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nAnd concerning what they wrote about Haji Mirza Fadlu'llah and Mashhadi Rajab-'Ali and his brother Aqa 'Abdu'l-Karim and their son Haji 'Abdu'llah, upon them be the Glory of God, they have requested mention. These verses were honored to be presented before the Divine Throne. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks:\n\nIn My Name, the Compassionate, the Generous \\[...\\]\n\nO Heydar! The Lord of Power hath made mention of thee and continueth to mention thee, and He saith: What now is thy service and what is thy devotion? Where is thy effect and where is thy fruit? Speak, O speak! \"O Thou Who art the Goal of all Prophets and Messengers! My life hath been spent in Thy path - this is my service. My devotion is to arise to serve Thy Cause and to praise and glorify Thee amongst Thy servants - this too is my service. My effect is to spread Thy laws and to make mention of Thy chosen ones and to love Thy friends - this too is my effect. As for the fruit, it is in Thy hands. It is not for me to speak or utter a word in this station. Should Thy grace take hold, Thou wouldst cause the fruits of this tree of servitude to appear in such wise as to become the cause of deliverance and freedom for all the peoples of the world. The Command is Thy command, and sovereignty lieth within Thy grasp and in the hold of Thy power. Thou doest what Thou willest.\" What can one say? All praise be unto Thee! Thy command is to be obeyed and Thy decree is accepted like life itself - nay, life hath no station and the soul in this place hath no worth. Exalted is Thy grandeur and elevated is Thy power! There is no ruler but Thee, no commander but Thee, no goal but Thee, and no beloved but Thee.\n\nO Heydar! Thou didst make mention of Jinab-i-Fadl. He had previously been honored by the Most Exalted Pen, and at this hour in the Most Great Prison he is remembered before the presence of the Great Announcement. Give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance, My mercy and My grace. We beseech God to assist him and strengthen him to make mention of Him and to praise Him and to accomplish that which hath been ordained by Him. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Expositor.\n\nWe make mention of Rajab-'Ali and recall what hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen, and give him the glad-tidings that his name hath attained the presence of the Wronged One in this noble station. O 'Abdu'l-Karim! This is the call that guided Moses on the Mount of Knowledge. When thou hearest it, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the hearts of them that are nigh!\" Verily We have made mention of those who have turned towards the Countenance and believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.\n\nO 'Abdu'llah! The Lord of all beings saith: The world hath attained success while the people are in strange delusion. They have turned away from My most exalted horizon, turning to the idols of their own selves. Verily they are among the most lost. Blessed art thou for having won the mention of Me while people were veiled by a thick veil. The glory from God, the Lord of the worlds, be upon you.\n\nThe four pillars have been blessed by the favors of the Lord of creation. This is the everlasting food and the eternal bounty. That beloved of the heart should take it with the hand of submission, and when it reacheth the four mouths and they taste its sweetness, they should utter the blessed words \"May it be enjoyable unto you.\" Verily the servant beholdeth the favor of his Lord and your Lord in such wise that mention and utterance are cut off from it. Exalted is the All-Merciful, our Creator and our Provider and the Goal of our hopes and our Aim and our Beloved and the Object of worship of all in the heavens and the earths.\n\nThe petition of Muhammad Hashim, upon him be the glory of God, attained the presence of the Most Holy Court. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in reply - the Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified:\n\nIn My Name, the Witness, the All-Informed \\[...\\]\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! The petition of Nabil-i-Hashim was presented before Our countenance and attained unto Our hearing. Blessed is he for having voiced praise of his Lord and for having attained unto His wondrous and mighty Tablet, from whose horizon hath shone forth the Luminary of grace - a command from Us, and verily I am the All-Commanding, the All-Wise. We have indeed detected from his mention the fragrance of sincerity. He hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken - sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds. They who have on this day attained unto a trace from My Most Exalted Pen are indeed among those who are brought near in My perspicuous Book. We give him the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for him from the heaven of His Lord's will, the All-Merciful, the Most Generous. We beseech God to assist and strengthen him in His remembrance, His praise, and the service of His Cause. He is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing. The Glory be upon him and upon those who, when they heard, responded and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the sincere ones!\"\n\nAfter his petition was presented before Him, the ocean of loving-kindness surged both before and after, revealing that which testifieth to the mercy, loving-kindness and tenderness of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is he, again blessed is he. The servant beseecheth success for him in all conditions.\n\nConcerning what thou didst mention about the four units of Huquq being assigned to Haji Nabil - upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory - to be forwarded, which apparently has been delayed, and the servant did not inquire \\[...\\] After this matter was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed - exalted be His utterance: \"Well done in what thou hast done, for the matter of Huquq dependeth upon the acceptance of the souls themselves. Should any soul, with the utmost joy and fragrance, of his own free will, desire to pay the Right of God, it is acceptable; otherwise, no. Verily thy Lord is independent of all worlds. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: 'O men! Ye are but poor in relation to God, but God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.' In all conditions one must look to the glory of the Cause.\"\n\nRegarding what thou didst write about intending to proceed to the Land of Sad, but having delayed due to the movement of the secretary and the unity of the last name - upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God - this matter was accepted before the Throne. The bounty of God, exalted be His glory, concerning them is beyond this servant's description. God willing, they have been and are assisted. In truth, they are the lamps of that land. The servant asketh his Lord to make them the standards of His guidance and through them to uplift His Cause in that region, its surroundings and its environs. Praise be to God, they have been and are mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur and are the recipients of special favors.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Haji Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God - the servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen him in remembrance and praise, to make him detached from all else save Him and firm in His Cause, to draw him nigh unto Him, and to grant him the best of what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, they are mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. The loved ones and friends of God should hearken to that beloved one's counsel. Once these exalted words were uttered by the Lord of all beings: \"O servant in attendance! The friends should listen with the ear of acceptance to the counsels and exhortations of Haydar.\" That which was revealed hath assuredly been and will be made manifest. Blessed are those servants who discover the sweetness of the Cause and taste the honey of deeds. Whosoever attaineth unto this will surely hold fast to God's command and arise to act. That beloved one's deeds are, praise be to God, acceptable, inasmuch as they were and are for the sake of God. This is the testimony of this evanescent servant, and my Lord is witness to what I say.\n\nHis Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath brought several letters from that beloved one to the Most Holy Court and requesteth replies. He hath not and doth not fall short in matters, but time is lacking, and what is sent sufficeth for seventy or eighty, for it is not limited to one or two Tablets, or one or two pages. In truth, what hath appeared and appeareth is divine confirmation, else how could this servant fulfill this mighty task except through His grace, favor and bounty. I beseech all to pray for confirmation and success for this evanescent one.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the people of Nur - unto God be praise, grace, bounty, and bestowal - this servant was greatly rejoiced by this matter, for the people of Nur have attained unto the shining, brilliant, radiant lights. They have turned toward the Sinai of inner meanings and have heard the voice of the Speaker of the Mount from the Temple of Manifestation. Blessed be their ears and their hearts in that they have heard and turned. It would be most regrettable were the people of the Tree to remain deprived of the Blessed Tree. This servant writeth and saith: \"Well done and congratulations!\"\n\nRegarding what was written about the philosophers, after it was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court, this utterance shone forth from the horizon of the Kingdom of the All-Merciful. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith:\n\nThe philosophers of that land should engage in teaching God's Cause with spirit and fragrance, wisdom and utterance. They should calm the fleeing souls with the water of divine wisdom and educate them with perfect measures until they reach maturity. After maturity, they will appear adorned with the crown of might, for He is the Critic, the Pulse-taker, the Mover, and the Transformer. Everlasting might hath been and will be His. This is a mention from Us and a mercy from Our presence. Verily, We aid them and strengthen them. Thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty. Theirs is to arise to serve the Cause, and His is the victory and the aid. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThis servant also conveyeth greetings and salutations to them and beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, on their behalf, that from which the fragrance of eternity wafteth. Verily our Lord and our Goal is powerful over all things. And mention was made of the houses of the khans, which attained the honor of being heard. The Desired One, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty, saith \\[...\\]\n\nVerily We have made mention of them before and after, and adorned them with the tokens of Our Most Exalted Pen, and caused them to hear My sweetest call. Make mention of them on My behalf and glorify them from the Wronged One Who stood before the faces of the world and with the most exalted call summoned the princes, the divines, the jurisprudents and the servants in the earliest days, and summoneth them to the horizon wherefrom hath shone the Day-Star of God's Revelation, the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.\n\nThis servant also conveyeth unto them greetings and glorification, and beseecheth God to set them ablaze with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree and to confirm them in His mention and praise. Ere long the station of every soul that hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, whom the rancor and hatred of the people of the world have not kept back from the Ancient Beauty, shall become manifest as the sun. Praise be to God! His power is manifest and His dominion evident. Who can flee from His sovereignty and dominion? Soon shall the wrongdoers witness the recompense of their deeds, and they who recognize His oneness the reward of what they have wrought in the path of God, our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nMention was made of Muhammad-Yusuf Khan, upon him be the Glory of God. Some time ago the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed especially for him and was dispatched. God willing, may he drink from the ocean of the Word of God and be illumined by its lights. This evanescent servant beseecheth from the Eternal Truth, exalted be His glory, that He may confirm him in promoting and serving the Cause. Through the exaltation of the Word, the outer and inner are reformed, and the station of the steadfast becometh manifest as the sun. There is no doubt about this, nor any uncertainty in what hath been sent down from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Two blessed Tablets were also revealed and sent specifically for the khans who were mentioned in the letter of Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nConcerning what was written about the Afnan, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, it was presented before His face, and these exalted words shone forth from the Dayspring of His Will. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\n\"O thou who standest to serve My Cause! The blessed Lote-Tree hath made mention of Its own Afnan with such mention before which all the mentions of the world bow down in humility. Verily We have aided them, exalted them, brought them nigh, and revealed for them that which hath made the lips of utterance to smile. Exalted is the Most Merciful Who hath ordained this great favor.\" They have been and are mentioned in the Most Exalted Horizon and the Supreme Perspective. We beseech God that He may enable all to do that which beseemeth His Day and shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. This Day is the Lord of all ages and centuries, and likewise any deed performed therein for the sake of God is the lord of deeds. Verily We glorify from this station their faces, and give them glad tidings of what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and confirm them in what We love and are pleased with. Verily their Lord is the All-Wise Last One, and He is the Kind, the Generous.\n\nThe fragrances of divine words have perfumed the world of utterance and meaning. Blessed is he who hath found, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nThis servant also conveyeth unto each one greetings, praise and glorification, and beseecheth confirmation and assistance for each. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nMention was made of Hadi Khan, upon him be the Glory of God. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed especially for him from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all beings, that it may attract him to the most exalted station. The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nIn My Name that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom \\[...\\]\n\nA mention from Us to the one who has attained unto the days of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, that the fragrances of remembrance may draw him to a station wherein he sees naught save the lights of the Luminary of the Cause, and hears naught save the call of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. This is My Day wherein the fragrances of My utterance have been wafted, My verses have been sent down, My evidences have appeared, and the tongue of My grandeur hath spoken: \"Verily, there is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\" Blessed is the one with vision who hath beheld the traces of My Most Exalted Pen, and the one with hearing who hath heard My sweetest call, and the one with strength who hath arisen to serve My Cause, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. He who loved Me hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee with verses that cannot be equaled by all the treasures and riches. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance, say: \"My God, my God! Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, and Thine is the power and the might, and Thine is the glory and the divine realm. I beseech Thee by Thy signs whereby the unitarians hastened to the place of sacrifice and the sincere ones to the scene of faithfulness, and by the evidences whereby Thou didst subdue all possibility, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, and upright in Thy service. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, clinging unto Thee, acknowledging Thy grandeur and Thy power, and confessing Thy oneness and Thy singleness. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word 'Be' and it is. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Loving.\"\n\nThus ended what was revealed for His Honour Haji Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn My Name, through which the ocean of utterance has surged in creation\n\nThe days of God are witnessed, His verses are revealed, and His evidences are manifest. His station is known, His call is raised without veil or covering, His Pen is in motion, and the banner \"The Truth has come\" is unfurled. Yet the people of the earth are bewildered and confounded. For thirteen hundred years they lamented and, with weakness and supplication, beseeched the Self-Sufficient One for the appearance of the Promised One, and from their pulpits they uttered \"May God hasten His advent.\" But when the Most Great Light dawned from the highest horizon of the world, all turned away, and the cause and reason for their turning away is known and evident. They did what no other people had done. Until now they remain in the graves of heedlessness. The Resurrection is established, the Hour is manifest, the Balance is set up, and the Cry is raised; yet they have not awakened and remain deprived of the ocean of life and the lights of the Sun of Truth. By the life of God! If they were to attain unto one drop from the ocean of awareness, they would arise from their graves and sacrifice themselves for a single word from the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Soon shall the heedless ones behold the recompense of their deeds, and those who have turned unto God shall receive the reward of what they have wrought in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Praise the Intended One of all the worlds, Who in such days has confirmed thee and guided thee to the horizon of the Most Great Name. This is a great bounty; know thou its station and be occupied with the remembrance and praise of the Intended One of all the worlds.\n\nThus ended, and likewise after mention of His Honour Mirza Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, before the presence, a holy and blessed Tablet appeared and was revealed from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen, that he might rejoice in the bounty of his Lord and be of the thankful ones. The Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified:\n\nIn My Name, the Compassionate, the Generous \\[...\\]\n\nO Ahmad! Mahmud makes mention of thee from the Most Glorious Prison while He stands before the faces of the world without helper or assistant, summoning all with the most exalted call to the supreme horizon. The power of nations did not prevent Him, nor did the opposition of the peoples of the world deter Him from His Cause. In the nights and days, evenings and mornings, He counseled the servants and guided them to that which profits them. All things testify that this Revelation hath appeared for the reformation of the world and the advancement of the nations. Blessed is the soul that hath inhaled the fragrances of revelation and recognized the Peerless Friend in this attire. The whole world was brought from nothingness into being for the recognition of the Ancient King, yet they are seen to be veiled and deprived. Blessed art thou and thy father - ye have attained to that which the divines of the earth are debarred from throughout ages and centuries. They considered themselves the most exalted of all peoples, yet on the Day of Reckoning they were seen as the most lost among the communities. We beseech God to assist thee in remembrance and praise, and to ordain for thee that which is the cause of enduring glory and everlasting bounty. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.\n\nThey have attained unto the splendors of the Day-Star of utterance from the Dawning-Place of Divine Unity. By the life of Our Purpose! It behooveth them to recite that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning them - a recitation wherein the effects of God's verses become manifest in them and in all who advance, whosoever they may be and wheresoever they may be found. The words of God, exalted be His glory, bestow life and grant everlasting bounty. Blessed are they and theirs is a goodly destination. Praise be to our Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. This lowly one conveys greetings and salutations to each one, and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to perfume them with the fragrances of verses - a perfume whose sweet scent shall spread throughout the world and waft among the peoples.\n\nAs for their mention of Haji Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory of God, the Luminary of God's grace, exalted be His glory, hath appeared from the horizon of the heaven of bounty upon the temple of the Tablet and was sent forth. I beseech God to assist him to take hold of the Tablet with such firmness that the world would be powerless to prevent him. This is not difficult for God.\n\nThey made mention of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali of Bahramabad, upon him be the glory of God. Praise and gratitude be unto Him! His mention is remembered before God and recorded in the Tablets by the Supreme Pen. After his mention was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, this most exalted Word shone forth like the sun from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. Thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Today the Dawning-Place of lights and the Source of divine signs speaks this word: Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Word of God in His days. Thou hast repeatedly attained unto the divine Tablets. Thy mention is remembered and thy name is recorded by the Supreme Pen. Rejoice in God's binding Word and say:\n\nMy God, my God! I testify that the hands of Thy bounty rescued me from idle fancies and vain imaginings, and Thy grace gave me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy knowledge and the choice wine of certitude in Thy Cause. Through Thy generosity Thou didst draw me nigh, through Thy mercy Thou didst make me know Thee, and through Thy power Thou didst raise me up. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Command and Thy Mighty Announcement to make me in all conditions hold fast to the cord of Thy generosity and stand firm in Thy love, such that the doubts of the world and the signs of the nations would not keep me from Thee. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and gazing at the horizon of Thy grace. Ordain for me that which befitteth the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. Verily Thou art the Lord of existence and the Sovereign over the seen and unseen. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nThis lowly servant has sought and continues to seek divine confirmation and success for them when inscribing verses. We beseech and implore God that He may assist them in spreading the verses and exalting His Word among His servants with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nRegarding the mention of the beloved of hearts, 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and Ibn-i-'Attar and Aqa 'Ali Haydar, upon them be the glory of God, His care and His mercy - they have always been and continue to be remembered. Their letters, praise be to God, constantly reach the friends in this land and responses are sent. The point is that they have always been and continue to be remembered and are confirmed in service to the Cause and in the mention and praise of God, exalted be His glory.\n\nConcerning the mention of Aqa 'Abbas-Quli and Aqa Siyyid Mu??afa, upon them be the glory of God, after being presented before the Face, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words - thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\n\"O Haydar-Qabli-'Ali! These two souls are remembered before the Wronged One. Both have attained to recognition and are distinguished by the traces of the Supreme Pen. Praise be to God, the glance of favor is directed towards them, as evidenced by what was revealed for them before and after. Convey My greetings to them. We beseech God, exalted is He, to ordain for them through His bounty and grace that which shall endure as long as His names and attributes endure, and to confirm them in His remembrance among His creation, and to decree for them what He has decreed for His chosen ones. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. There is no God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\"\n\nTheir service is evident and their devotion is known. Nothing escapes the knowledge of our Lord. This servant beseeches his Lord to send down upon them mercy from His presence, to ordain for them the good of this world and the next, and to grant them what He has written for those near to Him among His servants and the sincere ones among His creation. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great munificence.\n\nThe friends of God from the lands of T, Y, K, ?, A, B, Sh, ?, and Kh who have written to your honor and sought mention, have all had their names presented in the Most Holy Court at this time and have attained the honor of being heard, and each has been honored with the effulgence of the light of the mention of the Goal of the world's desire. Who can reckon the oceans of His favor or the heaven of His mercy? We are all powerless.\n\nIn the hours of night and day, the glance of kindness is directed toward the friends. His grace has encompassed all and His bounty has embraced all. We beseech Him to confirm us in thanksgiving and praise - thanksgiving worthy of this court and praise befitting this generosity and bestowal. Verily, He has power over all things. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you and who hear your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm of Might and Glory.\n\n=== END BH00027 ===\n\n=== START BH00028 ===\n\nO Jinab-i-Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!\n\nThe Night of the 19th of Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1305\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nGlorified and Holy is our Lord, the Lord of the angels and the spirit! The revealed verses have encompassed the world and the manifest evidences have encircled it. The pearls of the Ocean of the Beloved of creation, glorified be His majesty, are manifest and visible before all faces, and the Blessed Tree crieth out with the most exalted call. Despite these manifest outpouring favors and infinite mercy, the people of the world remain heedless. Some have heard and denied, while others have seen and turned away. True indeed is God's word, the Most High, the Most Great: \"How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn aside from them!\" Some have perceived the divine fragrances and with the finger of certitude have rent asunder the veils and torn away the shrouds. These are they who shine forth from the horizons of the heavens of fidelity, truthfulness, certitude and assurance. The ornaments of the world and the adornments of nations are to them mere illusion and utter nothingness. Wealth did not prevent them from drawing nigh, nor did power hold them back from sacrificing their wealth and lives. Hasan of heaven sacrificed his life in the land, and Husayn of the realm of inner meanings outwardly laid down his life. What had the one drunk, and what did the other imbibe? Glory be to God! The minds of all the world are bewildered and stupefied. How well spoke that desert-dwelling nomad: \"I would not trade a single piece of felt for the whole world.\" By felt he meant to express his love and sincerity. Glory be to God! These souls, despite possessing wealth, worldly position, honor and station among the people, were not prevented by what they possessed from attaining unto what God possessed. What state was that when the people demanded from them the word of denial? And what grace was it that preserved them? With utmost joy and assurance, with spirit and fragrance, they proceeded to the place of sacrifice. Likewise the souls before them - His Holiness Kazim - the wolves of the earth did what will never be erased from the book of sorrows, nor ever shall be.\n\nMy God, my God! Inscribe the names of Thy loved ones in the book of them that strive in Thy path. Since Thou hast forbidden verbal profession, keep them firm upon the straight path that all may, with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance, make Thy servants aware and grant them a portion from the ocean of knowledge. O Generous One! Every possessor of a tongue hath testified to the precedence of Thy mercy, and every possessor of vision hath acknowledged Thy magnanimity. With the hands of power, take hold of the hands of the weak ones, guide them to the kingdom of Thy might, and bring them into the spacious arena of Thy protection, that all may discover the sweetness of Thy utterance and become aware of the ocean of Thy bounty. O Merciful One! Since Thou hast created, show mercy and transform this remoteness into nearness, that all may come and find, and choose their dwelling beneath the canopies of Thy mercy. Thou art the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Your sublime letters and successive missives have arrived, each having a wondrous effect and novel influence, bestowing upon every element of existence an impact and condition. Though one contemplates many meanings, words to express them are not at hand. Praise and gratitude be to God, each one of these letters was, as it were, speaking with most eloquent tongue in sanctification, glorification, remembrance and praise of the Goal of all the worlds. Exalted be your Teacher, exalted be your Guide, exalted be your Supporter, exalted be your Inspirer, exalted be your Protector, exalted be your Helper, unto the endless End. It behooveth this servant to speak of the everlasting sovereignty of the Kingdom and to supplicate for God's favors and bounties, the ocean of His generosity and the sun of His grace, that there may be manifested from all things that which will draw him nigh unto the supreme Summit and the most exalted Horizon. On each occasion the letter of that beloved of the heart was presented before the throne of the Lord of Names and attained the honor of being heard, and each time the light of bounty dawned and the sun of grace shone forth, and at every moment it was thought that the elixir of the merciful utterance would adorn the world with a new element and a new spirit. Exalted be His bounty and mighty be the waves of the ocean of His bestowal and the effulgent rays of the sun of His utterance, until on this night - the nineteenth of Jamadiyu'th-Thani - another letter was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. The Lord - exalted and sanctified be He - spoke: \"In My Name through which the Kingdom of Utterance was manifested in the realm of creation.\"\n\nThe Mother Book speaks, calls and gives glad tidings to all of what has been sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds. The Mother of the Bayan calls out saying: \"The All-Merciful has come with a sovereignty before which neither the hosts of the heavens nor of the earth can stand.\" The heaven calls and summons all to the Dawning Place of the Manifestation, yet most of the people remain heedless. By God! The ocean of divine knowledge has surged, and each of its waves heralds to humanity what has appeared and shone forth from the horizon of God's will, the Goal of all who seek Him. Those who have arisen to aid the Cause are among the triumphant in My perspicuous Book. The All-Merciful has described them in the Furqan as \"men whom neither trade nor commerce can divert from the remembrance of God.\" We testify that this was revealed for My loved ones whom neither the profits of the world, nor the treasures of nations, nor whatsoever is possessed by princes and kings could prevent from turning towards the lights of their Lord's countenance, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. They have forsaken what the people possess, holding fast to that which has been sent down to them from the presence of the Powerful, the Ancient. These are men whom neither earthly power nor heavenly might can weaken. They have cast away all that imagination can grasp, yearning for the meeting with God, the Beloved of those who know Him.\n\nO thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who holdest fast to the cord of My loving-kindness, and uttereth My praise! Hear My call from around My throne: \"There is none other God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed.\" Say: O people! Fear God and make not this world your homeland. Turn to the homeland of the All-Merciful; it is the most glorious station for you, did ye but know it. Sanctify your hearts from envy and hatred. This is what ye have been commanded in God's Book, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Take the sealed wine in My Name, the Self-Subsisting, then drink thereof with remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: Beware lest ye follow your desires. Follow that which ye have been commanded by an Ancient Commander. Do the threats of princes frighten you? By My life, they are but slaves, and I am the true Sovereign. To this beareth witness the Tongue of Grandeur in this noble station.\n\nWe have delivered unto them the messages of their Lord openly and have sent down unto them clear verses, for I am the Almighty, the Powerful. The heaven hath come with the smoke of destiny, yet the people are prevented from turning to the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: The ocean of knowledge hath surged - and it is My knowledge - and this is the straight path. Say: Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Lord of Names, Who hath come with proof and evidence. Be fair, O people, and be not among the oppressors. Consider My Cause: Have I ever desired aught for Myself on earth? Reflect on what hath appeared from Me and be not among the transgressors. By My life, I have not preserved Myself for less than a moment - My deeds bear witness to this, if ye be of the fair-minded. From My tribulations, the Supreme Pen trembled and raised the cry of lamentation, saying: \"After Thee there shall be no Cause, O Lord of Names, and no pen after Thee, O Thou through Whose remembrance the remembrances of all who remember have been erased! How can I move across the tablet after Thee, and who would hear my scratching? Nay, by the lights of Thy shining, radiant face!\"\n\nThus have We sent down verses before and at this time, as a command from Our presence, and I am the Expositor, the All-Knowing. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and give them glad tidings of the river of My loving-kindness, the ocean of My mercy, and the heaven of My grace, and remind them of My verses that have encompassed the heavens and the earth. Say: Know ye the station of this Day and deprive not yourselves of that which hath appeared in truth, and be not among the heedless. That which grieveth you today shall pass away, and there shall appear what God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, hath ordained for you. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon whoever heareth thy word concerning this Cause, whereby the heart of every oppressor hath been shaken and the limbs of the polytheists have trembled.\n\nPraise and glory befit that Self-Subsisting Lord Who, without helper, supporter or outward cause, raised aloft the banner of \"The Kingdom is God's\" to the highest station in the world, and planted the standard of \"Verily I am the One Who abideth after all things have perished\" upon the most exalted places of earth. Great is His majesty and exalted His dominion and power! O leaf! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names. The tribulations of these days and their severity, and the trials of the loved ones, have been mentioned in the books of the past and future. Today is the day whereof it is said \"the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke,\" and \"thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they are not drunk: but severe is the punishment of God.\" Observe what was spoken: \"The Day when men will be like scattered moths, and the mountains will be like carded wool.\" The divine Books are filled with mention of the hardships of the Day of Judgment. Praise be to God, His loved ones have borne them and have been blessed with patience and steadfastness. O thou who gazest toward My horizon! The people have not been and are not heedless. The pearls of wisdom and utterance that were ever hidden within the shells in the ocean of divine knowledge have, through the power of the Supreme Pen, been made manifest and visible before all faces, yet the knowing one is missing and the seeing one is nowhere to be found. In truth, the Word is that which was revealed aforetime: the ears of these people have not been and are not capable of hearing. Every person of insight beareth witness to this. Where are the ears, where are the ears, where are the ears? And where are the eyes, where are the eyes, where are the eyes? Nevertheless, in all conditions the Omnipotent Cause and the pervading Will have prevailed and shall continue to prevail. We beseech God that this victory may be achieved through spirit and joy, not through the deeds of ravening beasts. In every age the idolaters strove with utmost effort to extinguish the light, yet found themselves to be losers and saw themselves powerless. No thing among all things hath ever prevented or will ever prevent the operation of the divine Will and Purpose. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and gladden them with the lights of the Luminary of utterance that hath shone forth from the heaven of the Pen of the All-Merciful. We beseech God to assist all to that which leadeth to the exaltation of the Cause and the elevation of existence. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.\n\nPraise be to God! The waves of the sea of bounty and the rains from the clouds of the favor of the Lord of all beings are pouring down and following one upon another. Yet nostrils have become useless and perceptions idle and void. The fragrance of utterance has encompassed all creation, yet none perceives it. Moreover, if they had not claimed faith in what they possess, the superstitions and ignorance of people would not have reached such a degree. For instance, the followers of the Gospel attempt to prove their religion with two pages, while remaining heedless and turning away from the oceans of meanings and the purpose of the Lord of all worlds. This evanescent servant begs and hopes from the Truth that He may bestow one drop from the ocean of His knowledge upon the heedless ones of the world, and grant one particle from the light of His recognition to the blind ones of the earth. Perchance they may then hold fast to that which is the cause of salvation for all, and the world may be freed from successive calamities and continuous afflictions. Today nothing is heard from all directions save the clashing of swords. Four persons, nurtured by pride, do not allow the world to find rest and be adorned with the light of wisdom and utterance. Their multitude, power and capacity have prevented them from attaining the Most Great Peace, even though such capacity has never been and will never be the cause and means of profit. Rather, it is the cause of manifest loss. Alas! Alas! Where is understanding? Where is understanding? True spoke he who said: \"People are asleep; when they die, they awaken.\" But now no awakening is evident. And true spoke he who said: \"Verily, a true believer is rarer than red sulfur.\" In any case, we hope from His boundless generosity that His hidden grace may encompass and pervade all, and guide them to the sacred court of nearness to the Lord of all beings - may the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation be a sacrifice unto Him. The plea and supplication are from the servant, and the response and acceptance from his Lord.\n\nAs to what you have mentioned regarding the matter of \"between two matters\" and have written that praise be to God, in these days through the hidden divine favors, deliverance has been achieved from that known matter of \"between two matters\" - after this was presented before the Presence of Divine Unity, these blessed words were revealed, He says, blessed and exalted be He:\n\nO Dove! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. In the Tablet of Haydar-'Ali, upon him be My glory, the purport of these supreme words was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: Praise sanctified above the mention and utterance of all creation beseemeth the Goal of all beings, in that His loved ones, through hope of His promise and fear of His warning, transgressed not His commandments. They trampled corruption under foot and raised up the hand of power for the reformation of the world. O Dove! Upon thee be My mercy. Beseech the Truth that He may adorn all with the raiment of sanctity and confirm them in that which is conducive to the manifestation of human virtues. Although in the Psalms, Tablets, Scriptures and Books, conflict and corruption have been wholly forbidden, and firm commandments have been revealed enjoining love, fellowship, trustworthiness and reformation, most people are still observed to be in doubt and uncertainty. Day and night the tongue is occupied with the mention of the friends and uttereth that which is the cause of exaltation and the means of glory and loftiness of the Cause and the elevation of the Most Exalted Word. Blessed are they that act! Blessed are they that understand! However, evil and treacherous souls have been and are seeking to deceive the sincere and pure ones. Glory be to God! Although they observe that corruption is the cause of the world's ruin and the abasement of nations, they cling to it and hold fast to schemes and craftiness. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to prevent them through His sovereignty, might and power. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.\n\nThat which you wrote concerning S, may God assist him, is a cause for wonderment. Despite having traveled the world and witnessed the ups and downs of affairs and seen profit and loss in various lands, he remains heedless of thoughts whose harm returns to himself and others, and is still occupied with vain imaginings. In any case, after this matter was mentioned in His presence, He said that one must pray for him. The flame of this rejected deed is like the flame of the tongue - every fire may be extinguished, but the fire of the tongue leaves its trace throughout centuries and ages. One word bestows eternal life while another brings everlasting death. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him in recognizing what harms and benefits him and what will save him from destruction.\n\nIn His presence, they heard directly from the Tongue of Grandeur words that are the cause of the reformation of the world and the salvation of himself and all on earth, yet they did not turn away from their imaginings. Due to the love that existed between us, I have besought and continue to beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, for their protection. Verily our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth has power over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nConcerning what you mentioned about Haji Mirza Musa, it is exactly as you wrote. However, Haji Abdul-Karim, upon him be the glory of God, is very enkindled and loving, and through love for him has mentioned and continues to mention his acceptance. Your petition mentioning him was sent by the aforementioned Haji, upon him be the glory and favor of God, to the Most Holy Court, and an answer was revealed and sent that he might rejoice and be among the thankful ones. In truth, your honor has acted with wisdom according to the words of our Lord: \"Be not assured by everyone who comes, and believe not every speaker.\" Nevertheless, in all conditions, mere forbearance and the manifestation of love and affection is beloved, just as you have acted.\n\nThey mentioned Mirza Nabil-i-Akbar (Nabil-i-Qa'ini), upon him be the glory and favor of God, and likewise mentioned his enkindlement with the fire of the love of the All-Merciful, and also mentioned those souls who through his guidance and direction have attained to the Most Great Path, the Straight Path, and the Mighty Announcement. These matters were presented in His presence, whereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused bodies, let alone spirits, to soar. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn the Name of the All-Knowing Speaker\n\nPraise be sanctified beyond the comprehension and minds, and exalted above the recognition of all who dwell in the realm of possibility, befitting the most holy and sacred court of the Intended One, Who through wisdom and utterance has taken possession of the cities of the hearts of the people of possibility. The turning away of the peoples of the world, both lowly and noble, and the heedlessness of the nations, both learned and mystic, did not prevent Him from His purpose. The veils of error and the clouds of glory did not withhold the power of His Pen and the penetration of His Will from conquest. His standard is \"He is God\" and His banner \"The Lord of all beings has come.\" Blessed are those souls who hearkened to His call and with sanctified and pure hearts took shelter beneath His banner. Exalted is the Word and exalted its power, mighty is the Sign and glorious its station, and exalted is its influence.\n\nO Balance! Today the Balance speaks saying \"I am verily the All-Knowing Discerner.\" The true balance has been and ever shall be the love of God. Blessed are they who are illumined by the light of His Cause and enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote Tree. Give thanks to the Goal of all mankind that thy mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur, both before and after. The riches of the world and the remembrances of nations all return to nothingness, but the verses of God and what He hath ordained endure forever. The oppression of tyrants, the clamor of aggressors, and the vicissitudes of ages and centuries neither alter nor efface them. In the realm of the Supreme Pen there is no obliteration, only affirmation upon affirmation. We beseech the Lord thereof to increase His confirmations unto thee at all times and make thee a herald in His Name and one who proclaims His remembrance. Verily He is powerful over all things.\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Son of Mary said: \"Thou hast given me that which the learned and the wise have failed to comprehend.\" How many scholars, nobles, princes and mighty ones are deprived, their names erased from the book of acceptance and favor, while how many servants who were outwardly counted among the weak and ignorant have attained the highest station of glory, exaltation, knowledge and wisdom. God effaceth what He willeth and confirmeth what He willeth, and with Him is the Mother Book. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee, for thou hast drunk of the sealed wine and hast bestowed it upon others. This is a great bounty - recognize its station and be of the thankful ones.\n\nPraise be to God! They have received the greatest portion and mightiest share from the Kingdom of Utterance of the Goal of all beings, and have recorded in the book of the world their righteous deeds and the bestowal of the Revealer of verses. This word is preserved from obliteration in the divine Treasury of Infallibility and sanctified from change. Those souls who have been quickened by a new spirit and who have turned toward the eternal realm through the divine wine of utterance - their mention was presented at the Most Holy Court, and these verses were revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance specifically for the aforementioned souls. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks thus - this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Karbila'i Husayn from Khuy, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the Hearer, He is the Answerer\n\nO Husayn! Hearken with thy spiritual ear to the call of the Wronged One, that it may draw thee from thy earthly homeland to thy divine homeland, and lead thee from transient abasement to everlasting glory. His bounty hath no bound or end - before a single drop from this Ocean, all the seas of the world cry out \"Would that we were with thee!\" Every mention is humbled before the mention of God, and every sound is submissive. The water of life hath been breathed into the reality of creation through His utterance. The trumpet hath been sounded and the decree of resurrection hath appeared - praise be to God, the Kind, the Forgiving! If thou hast drunk from the Kawthar of eternity which lieth concealed within the words of the Lord of Names, and hast found thyself detached from all else besides God, say \\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself and revealed that which was hidden from eternity in the treasuries of Thy power and the repositories of Thy protection. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign over the seen and unseen, by Thy call which was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and I implore Thee by Him at Whose appearance all names bowed down, and by the stream of Thy utterance in the realm of creation and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty amidst all religions, to make me firm, steadfast, immovable and upright in Thy Cause. I moreover beseech Thee, O Lord of all beings, to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, in such wise that I move not except by Thy will, nor act save as Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThis was revealed for Asadu'llah of Nishapur, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!\n\nThe Hidden has appeared and the Light hath shone forth from the horizon of Revelation, and all things have proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens. He hath come for the life of the world, yet the peoples are in evident doubt. O Lion! Whoso hath attained unto this Day and hath arisen to help his Lord through wisdom and utterance, he verily is the lion of the jungle of knowledge before his Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed are they that have attained. Hearken unto the Call - verily it speaketh in every state: The Promise hath come, and the Promised One proclaimeth: He is God; there is none other God but Him, the Peerless, the Mighty, the All-Praised. By God! This is the Day of Return, yet the people are turning away. Blessed is he who hath soared on the wings of certitude in this holy, luminous, fragrant and exalted atmosphere. Take hold of the verses with the hands of submission and contentment, then recite them - they will draw thee to the Kingdom of utterance. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. Nothing profiteth Him nor doth any matter harm Him. He hath appeared and revealed what He willeth through His all-pervading grace. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of Mine utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Wronged One of the world, and Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Glory of the worlds.\n\nThis was revealed for the brothers Aqa Khalil of Khuy and Aqa Javad, upon them be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the True, the Faithful!\n\nO Khalil! Verily the Glorious One remembereth thee from the prison precinct and calleth thee unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. He hath accepted afflictions for the comfort of all in the kingdom of creation, and thereby the seal of the Choice Wine hath been broken - blessed are they that drink thereof. At His Name all names have bowed down, and by His command the ocean of knowledge hath surged - exalted be God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. We beseech God to assist His servants to turn unto Him - verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Blessed is the soul that hath not been hindered by the doubts of the barking ones nor frightened by the might of the idolaters. Give thanks unto God thy Lord that He hath assisted thee and caused thee to know that which most of creation hath been prevented from knowing. Thy Lord is verily the All-Informing, the All-Knowing. How many silent ones have spoken in My days, and how many speakers have been prevented from this beauteous Remembrance. We beseech God to assist His loved ones to remain steadfast in His Cause - verily He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty. We remember thy brother and give him glad tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nO Javad! The Dawning-Place of thy Lord's verses hath appeared, yet most of the people are turning away. The Call hath been raised before the faces of all men, yet most of the people are heedless. They see, yet they deny - verily they are abased in the Book of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. We beseech God to assist thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nThis was revealed for Haji Ahmad Salmasi, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the One dawning from the horizon of the Kingdom\\[...\\]\n\nThis is a mention from Our presence for one whom the attraction of the Call drew to the Most Exalted Horizon, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. Say: My God, my God! I testify that Thy Call attracted me, and the fire of Thy Lote-Tree was ignited, and the light of Thy Cause illumined me, and the choice wine of Thy utterance intoxicated me, and the influence of Thy Most Exalted Pen transformed me, and Thy grace guided me, and Thy generosity made me know Thee. I beseech Thee by the Luminary of certitude, which hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy heaven, to make me in all conditions one who speaks Thy praise, who stands firm in service to Thy Cause, who gazes toward the horizon of Thy Manifestation, who holds fast to the cord of Thy wisdom, and who acts according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Kind. O my Lord! Aid me to remember Thee with wisdom and utterance. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge. All things have spoken before the faces of mankind with the signs of Thy unity and that which proved the sanctification of Thy Self from peers and the exaltation of Thy Being above all likeness. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nThis was revealed for Mulla Aqa of Salmas, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the All-Wise Teacher!\n\nGlorified be God! The Most Exalted Pen is bewildered and all things are deep in thought. What has occurred that hath prevented the servants from drawing nigh unto the Truth? Has there ever been seen among the parties on earth a Cause greater than this Cause, or has there been witnessed a Book more exalted than the Mother Book which speaketh before all parties in the hereafter? Nay, by His true Self! All books are dependent upon this Most Great Book and all scriptures circle round it. All the seas of the world cannot equal one drop from the ocean of its knowledge. He is the Self-Subsisting One Whose appearance was heralded and Whose praise was uttered in previous Books. The peoples of the world turn toward temples out of love for His name, yet they remain heedless of His appearance and veiled from His verses. Some among the former peoples are deprived of even a leaf of the Most Great Book and are forbidden even a word from the Mother Book. Consider the people of the Furqan - deceitful, heedless souls have tormented the helpless people in the pit of vain imaginings, to such extent that until now they remain deprived of the breezes of revelation and bereft of the effulgences of the rays of the Sun. O Mulla Aqa! Hearken unto the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the Sun of Thy Manifestation, the Sea of Thy knowledge, and the Heaven of Thy grace. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby Thou hast subdued the earth and heaven, to make me hold fast unto Thee and be detached from all else save Thee. O my Lord! Thou art the Powerful One by Whose Most Exalted Word the hearts of the chosen ones and the near ones were attracted. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Guardian over all names, to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise in such wise that the oppression of the oppressors, the plotting of the plotters, and the cawing of the crows shall not prevent me. Then cause me to be among those who have fulfilled Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis was revealed for Aqa 'Ali of Salmas, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nIn the Name of Him through Whom the sea surgeth and the fragrance wafteth \\[...\\]\n\nToday the Book of God speaks for itself, the Sign of God is manifest, and the Light of God is resplendent. Yet the heedless servants are deprived of the light of certitude by the darkness of fancy, and are barred from the presence of the Self-Subsisting by their vain imaginings. The cleaving of the heavens, the splitting of the earth, the spreading of the signs, and the rising of souls from their graves--all these are apparent and witnessed. Likewise, the seal of the choice wine has been broken, the Balance is set up, and the Path is laid out. But only those possessed of vision attain unto these and rejoice in beholding them. A few prevaricators of the world have become veils and have prevented the people of the earth from the supreme bounty and the greatest good. These are the veils of glory and the coverings of error. Beseech ye God that He may deliver His servants and rend asunder, with the finger of power, the concealing veils. They are His servants and His creation. Should He have mercy upon them, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful, and should He chastise them, He is the Ruler over what He willeth.\n\nSay: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having opened before the faces of Thy servants the gates of Thy tender mercies and Thy favors, and for having guided them unto Thy path, and made them know the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy inspiration, and the Source of Thy commandments. O Lord! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and strengthen my limbs through Thy power and might. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Powerful.\n\nWould that this servant were with them and attained unto that which they have attained! I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may aid them to drink of the choice wine of utterance from the revealed verses and to witness the lights of the Sun of bounty from the horizon of the Tablets. His grace hath encompassed all. The accepted souls have been mentioned before mention and likewise after the mention of names they have attained unto another mention. Who is capable of enumerating this supreme bounty? None, by God, except His Self, the One Who dominates the worlds.\n\nAs for your mention of Aqa Mirza Majid, upon him be the Glory of God, and your request for his remembrance, after it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, the carpet of utterance was spread out and the ocean of bounty surged. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nO Dove! Upon thee be the glory of the Lord of all beings and the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Possessor of the Throne above and the earth below. The mention of Majid hath repeatedly flowed from the Pen of bounty. He turned and attained. Neither the doubts of the dubious, nor the clamor of the heedless, nor the roaring of the aggressive ones prevented him. Give him the glad tidings of My mention of him, then send unto him what We have sent unto thee, that the Call may attract him and draw him nigh unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. O Majid! This is the Day of assistance, and assistance hath ever been and still is through the teaching of the Cause. The loved ones must guide the servants to the pathway of the Purpose of the worlds through wisdom and utterance. Perchance rejection may be transformed into acceptance, darkness into light, the pond into the river, and bitter fluid into sweet water. In all conditions, keep your gaze fixed upon wisdom, for some are weak and are disturbed by the might of the deniers and the polytheists. Speech in measure is the water of life for hearts, but if it exceeds bounds it becomes the cause of the kindling of the fire of hatred and animosity. Divine grace hath encompassed all and His mercy hath taken precedence, therefore the teaching of the Cause must be carried out with moderation and be made manifest. We beseech God to assist His loved ones and aid them in His mention and praise. Verily, He is the Helper, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nEvery word is a speaking book and a manifest scroll. Through the grace, care and mercy of the Goal of all worlds, from the beginning of the Cause until now the call has been raised, the Pen has moved without helper or assistant, the banner has appeared and been unfurled. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to make His servants aware and grant them vision, that they may witness the effulgences of the light of His grace in all things and hear His call from the most exalted horizon. Exalted is the care of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth!\n\nMention was made of the beloved of the heart, his honor Ibn-i-Dakhil, upon him be the Glory of God. In truth, what was written is correct and they are deserving. After being presented at the Most Holy Court, special verses were revealed and sent for each of the names that were submitted. A hundred thousand congratulations to them, for they both attained His grace and became the cause of abundant good. Divine grace has seized them. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nMay God, exalted be His glory, grant His servants the power to hear and the capacity to accept after understanding. Praise be to God, the Cause is firmly established and the banner of the Manifestation is raised. Whether willingly or unwillingly, the servants have accepted and will accept. There is no escape nor refuge save unto Him. I beseech His all-encompassing grace, His all-embracing mercy, and His universal generosity. His servants are powerless and weak, and He is the Giver, He is the Strong, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nRegarding what was written about His honor who bears the name of the Goal and his brother, upon them both be the Glory of God, after being presented in His presence these manifest verses were revealed. The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nHe is the Speaker \\[...\\]\n\nO thou who drinkest of My Sealed Wine! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The one bearing thy name hath aforetime been adorned with the ornament of grace and illumined with the lights of the Day-Star of bounty. He sought attainment unto His presence, and God is well aware, doth Himself speak and doth Himself testify that the presence of them that have turned unto Him hath ever been and shall ever be beloved. However, the weakness of the servants hath become a barrier and a mighty obstacle. A certain oppressor in this land was seated in authority and engaged in tyranny and corruption. In truth, at no time, whether by day or by night, had he and justice ever dwelt in one place. Indeed, the city wherein he resided was deprived of the effulgences of the Day-Star of justice. Glory be to God! Tyranny was beloved to him and oppression desired, justice rejected and equity banished. Though the Angel of Death hath taken his place in justice, though he is gone, his influences remain. Certain souls had permission from years past, nevertheless at present it appeareth not expedient, inasmuch as most of the people of these lands are inflamed with the fire of hatred. Convey My greetings to the aforementioned one and give him the glad-tidings of the lights of the Sun of the tender mercies of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God, exalted be He, to inscribe for him from the Pen of Command the reward of attaining His presence and standing before His countenance. Verily, He is powerful over all things. As to the second one, We have named him at the Throne 'Midhat'. Give him the glad-tidings of this manifest bounty and this loving-kindness that hath encompassed the heavens and the earths. O Nightingale! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of all mankind. Give glad-tidings unto the leaf who hath been named Tuba and her daughter. Verily We have heard their call and have made mention of them in such wise as cannot be equaled by the mentions and deeds of all peoples. O My handmaiden, O My leaf! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison, which God hath made a fountain of utterance for all creation and a river of knowledge for them that are assured. Rejoice, O My handmaiden, in My mention, My loving-kindness and My bounty. Praise be unto Him Who hath aided thee and enabled thee to turn unto that which nothing in all creation can equal. The glory of God be upon thee and upon thy daughter and upon every handmaiden who hath believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. The bounty of God hath taken thee and His loving-kindness hath guided thee in days wherein most of the men of the world have turned away, though all were created for turning unto Him and were brought from nothingness into being for His recognition. Shouldst thou ponder this all-encompassing, pre-existent bounty, thou wouldst cry aloud and utter \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!\" And We make mention of another leaf whom thou didst mention in thy letter. In truth, the station of the leaves and handmaidens in this Cause is most exalted, for they have accepted that which the learned and accomplished ones, by their own admission, are powerless to comprehend and recognize. Give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and remind her of My verses. By My life! Were she to find their sweetness, she would swoon away in that very moment. And We make mention in this perspicuous Tablet of him who hath been named Ali. O Ali! We beseech God that names may not hold thee back from the Lord thereof. Set thy feet upon all else but God and lift up thy head through His love. Blessed is the head that hath been adorned with the crown of His love and hath bowed down before His loved ones. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nHe is possessed of grace and bestowal, His is the bounty, might and glory, for He hath adorned all created things through one of the relationships that referreth to His Most Holy Station. Blessed is the ocean that taketh pride in its relationship to His verses, and the rain that is associated with His mercy, and the sun that is mentioned in connection with His effulgences. This all-encompassing, infinite grace that hath encompassed land and sea and heaven hath surely singled out and distinguished His servants, who are the treasuries of His love and the repositories of His remembrance, through His favors, and will continue to do so. Soon will He elevate their stations, ranks and degrees. Verily He is the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nThe pen-marks of that beloved one which were sent before, in view of the waves of the sea of love which at times are above, at times below, at times before and at times after - a sovereign that hath power over the changes and transformations of the will and purpose in the world of existence - the answer thereto is now submitted without arrangement. In truth, the disorder of the world ariseth from this station of differences, although this slight disorder gathereth together and taketh on the pattern of order and arrangement. However this station is special to the horsemen in the arena of hearing and sight. In any case, that beloved one's letter which was adorned with the date of the tenth of Jumada'th-Thani was a wondrous essence, for it gave both hearing and sight their portion of nearness and attainment - nay rather, it bestowed perfect joy and delight upon heart and spirit. Praise be to God that from every word thereof wafted the fragrance of detachment and spread abroad the sweet scents of sincerity. The servant beseecheth his Lord to strengthen thine arm to shatter the idols of vain imaginings and the temples of idle fancies. Verily He is the Single, the Triumphant, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAfter its reading and perusal, on wings of yearning it ascended to the Most Exalted Station and was presented before the face of the Lord of Names and achieved the honor of His attention. This is what the Intended One spoke in reply - the Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nHe is the Commander, the Speaker, the Powerful, the Mighty\n\nThe Beloved One's Book calleth out, and the Word speaketh with most eloquent utterance, and the letters speak before all faces. By the life of God! The purified ear heareth from all things the glad-tidings of His manifestation and His days. Glory be to God! The poison of heedlessness hath affected all limbs, members and veins, and hath prevented all from attaining to understanding and awareness. Now they are seen to be in the throes of death, save those souls who have been healed with the Supreme Medicine of the Most Great Name. Make mention of the loved ones of that land before the Wronged One, that hearts may be illumined with the light of knowledge and souls set ablaze with the fire of love. O Dove! O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! If they truly attain unto a drop from the ocean of bounty, they will find themselves detached and free from all else besides God. In these days one of those who have turned toward God newly sought assurance and certitude, and in reply We spoke these exalted words:\n\nHe is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise \\[...\\]\n\nO Perfumer! Thy letter came before the Wronged One and was honored with His glance of favor. Praise be to God, the fragrance of acceptance wafted from it. We beseech God to assist thee and aid thee, and make thee among those who, when they hear, say: \"Praise be to Thee, O Desire of the world, for having made us recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Source of Thy firm, unshakeable, mighty Command!\"\n\nThou didst seek assurance. The time for such words and utterances hath passed, for there hath appeared that which, from the beginning of the world until now, the like of which hath not been witnessed. Today the light shineth forth from the highest horizon of the world, and the fire in the Blessed Tree speaketh with the most exalted call, while from the heaven of divine Will there descend, without interruption, books, scriptures and epistles. The pens of the world, the thoughts of nations, and the power of books are incapable of reckoning them.\n\nToday the temple of assurance speaketh: \"Praise be to Thee, O Gracious Bestower!\" and the tongue of certitude uttereth: \"I believe in Thee, O Wronged One!\" They spoke of the splitting of the moon - the splitting of the sun became manifest, appearing at the time when Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi, who was the pivot of the divines of Iran, strayed from the path and returned to his abode.\n\nO questioner! The sun of assurance shineth resplendent from the horizons of the heaven of God's Tablets. Today, the Friend (Abraham) hath said \"My heart is at rest,\" and He Who conversed with God (Moses) uttereth \"Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!\" With one Pen We struck down all the swords of the world. Hast thou not seen? Hast thou not heard? Return to the Tablets; verily they will draw thee to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nReflect upon what hath come to pass, and ponder what hath been revealed, that perchance thou mayest attain unto the splendors of the Day-Star of the All-Merciful's utterance and be seated upon the throne of assurance. All that existeth in heaven and earth cannot equal one of His words. The Truth is distinguished from all else by all His signs. Blessed are they who are adorned with the ornament of justice and equity. He, verily, is the All-Knowing Helper.\n\nWe beseeched His Majesty the Sultan for that which was the greatest means for the manifestation of the Day-Star of assurance in all regions and certitude among the servants. He rejected it and committed that which caused the Concourse on High to weep and lament. Say: O friends! Strive that perchance through the fire of the All-Merciful's love, the veils that have intervened may be consumed. The veils are such matters as prevent man from drawing nigh and turning towards God. Blessed is the soul that hath rent asunder the intervening veils through the power of detachment and the armor of might, and hath arisen to render assistance through wisdom and utterance.\n\nSay: Ye are accounted before God as the trees of His garden of inner meanings. Preserve this station through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. Reflect upon the Pharaohs and tyrants of the world, and likewise upon the treasures and palaces of those heedless souls. By the Life of God! The days of life in this world have been, in the eyes of them that possess insight, less than a moment. O My loved ones! Fear the All-Merciful, and be of such character that nothing whatsoever, no name among names, no mention among mentions, may hinder you.\n\nThe Shi'ih sect hath remained deprived of the One Who owns the Names, and on the Day of Judgment they were seen to be lower than the idolaters, as ye have witnessed and heard, and now see and hear. Even now they occupy themselves with cursing the Truth from all pulpits. We beseech God, exalted be He, to reinforce you with the hosts of utterance and draw you nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Gracious.\n\nThe power of the world is powerless before His might, and utterance is humbled before the dawning splendors of the Sun of His utterance. It is hoped that through the divine fragrances of revelation and the manifestations of boundless heavenly grace and mercy, this Most Great Community will appear with such power and might that the doubts of the world and the whisperings of the nations will not hold them back from the Most Great Name, and they will arise to serve the Cause with penetrating vision, attentive ears, and steadfast feet, devoting themselves to the reformation of the world and the refinement of the souls of all peoples. Verily our Lord is the All-Knowing Helper, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nHow strange, utterly strange, that recently Hadi Dawlat-Abadi has become a leader of the people and has intended to organize a party from among the Shi'ih. By the life of our Beloved! He is among those of whom it is said: \"They have changed God's favor into blasphemy and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition.\" Strange that he has never been, nor is he now, aware of the foundation of the Cause. It is not known by what wings he flies or to what he clings. \"They who denied the meeting with God and His signs are indeed among the greatest losers in the Book of our Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.\"\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the translation of the divine verses revealed in the Tablets to the Kings, after it was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were uttered from the Tongue of Grandeur - thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: \"Well done indeed! We beseech God to assist him in translating what was revealed to the kings. He is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nO Varqa! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. Beseech God not to deprive His servants, that all may attain to that which is the purpose of creation. If they would hearken with outer and inner ears and observe with penetrating eyes, the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful would so attract them all that they would find themselves detached and sanctified from all that exists. Glory be to God! The false sayings of the past have become a barrier and have held back the servants from the Kawthar of utterance. We beseech God to protect His community and illumine all with the light of unity. He is the Hearer, the Answerer, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nConvey greetings to all from the tongue of the Wronged One. Say: O loved ones of God! He has counseled you with wisdom and counsels you in this Tablet with the same. You should meet with all peoples of the earth in perfect spirit and fragrance. Convey to the heedless such utterances as contain hidden within them the sweetness of sugar and the delicacy of milk, for certain deniers are seeking to find pretexts to which they may cling and thereby bring about that which would cause confusion and disturbance. If they act according to what has flowed from the Pen, soon will the fruits of the Tree of Utterance and the effulgences of the Sun of Knowledge become manifest from every land. Blessed is he who has heard and acted upon that which he was commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nThis servant and that Beloved One and other trusted ones must remind the loved ones and beseech for each from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever will cause the upliftment of the Word and the exaltation of the Cause. In these days some news has arrived from the Land of ?a. Surely it has spread to those lands as well. Regarding the aforementioned person, all must remain silent and still. Some time ago, this matter was written and sent to the Land of ?a as commanded. Last week this servant also submitted and sent a brief note, the purpose being to deliver the blessed and holy Tablets to their recipients that they might attain unto them. In these days, previously revealed verses are being and have been read in His presence. God willing, they will be sent complete and accurate. This is among His other favors, a bounty from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nAs for what you wrote concerning the Kingdom, after being submitted to the Most Holy Court, this supreme utterance was revealed, His words, blessed and exalted be He: \"O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings! The intended meaning of 'Kingdom' in the first degree and primary station is the Greatest Scene, and in its final station is the realm of similitudes between the world of might and the material world. Whatsoever exists in heaven and earth has its likeness therein. When concealed in the power of utterance it is called Jabarut, and this is the first station of limitation. When it becomes manifest it is called Malakut. It derives power and strength from the first station and bestows it upon what is below.\" These worlds and the worlds of Will, Purpose, Decree, Destiny, Eternity, Perpetuity, Age and Time have repeatedly been revealed from the Supreme Pen in certain Tablets. Blessed are they who attain! As for what has been interpreted in Persian as \"padshahi\" and \"jahan-i-payandih\", both are correct and acceptable.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about the Most Exalted Habitation and the Dawning-Place of the elevation of sacred places and stations of the world, by command its mention and implementation are not permitted in these days. Should God will it, He will mention it.\n\nTruly the hearts of those near and the souls of the unified are inflamed and consumed by mention of what occurred in that place. This deed of the Shi'ih party shall never be erased from the book of existence. No rebellion in the world can compare with it. O Beloved of my heart! Nevertheless, today the polytheists of the world and the corruptors of nations, like that party, are occupied with vain imaginings and idle fancies. The words of the past have exactly repeated and appeared anew. Shame upon them and their sense of justice and their deeds! We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to purify the ears and illumine the eyes and cause justice and fairness to appear. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nThey have claimed the Persian utterance has been altered. This statement has previously caused myriads upon myriads of helpless people to go astray, for by this statement the decree of the Book is nullified and every falsifying atheist finds opportunity and gives free rein to the steed of falsehood and hatred. God, exalted be His glory, through His grace and favor in this Revelation has unveiled and made manifest these concealed matters and unknown conditions. May my spirit be sacrificed for His favor and His unveiling! They had formed a divine group and considered themselves unified. God protect us and you from the calumnies of these people. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the Wise.\n\nAnother missive from that Beloved One hath been received, wherefrom wafteth the morning breeze. Praise be to God, it was fresh, for it appeared from a pure nature, and was refreshing, being adorned with remembrance and praise of the Beloved. After its recitation in the Most Holy Court, the servant findeth himself incapable of expressing what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered at that time, save to a known measure. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!\n\nThe servant who is present hath appeared and presented before the face of the Wronged One that which the tongue of thy heart and the pen of thy outward being have uttered in praise of God, the Lord of all worlds. We bear witness that thou hast held fast to God's Covenant and His Testament, and neither the tempests of the Pharaohs nor the hurricanes of the tyrants moved thee, and neither the veils of the divines nor the barriers of the theologians prevented thee. Thou hast urged forward the steed of resolve in the service of God, the Sovereign of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Remind the servants of My verses and give them the glad-tidings of My tender mercy. Say: O My loved ones! This is the Day of Utterance, a Day the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. Aid ye the Wronged One with the hosts of goodly deeds and virtuous character. This is what ye have been commanded in diverse Tablets, as doth testify to this the Lord of all creation from His mighty prison. Say: Beware lest love of these fleeting days withhold you from the enduring, everlasting grace and eternal, perpetual life. Cast away what the people possess, clinging fast to that which is with God, your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Verily, He hath come at the appointed time, riding upon the clouds, to teach you that which will draw you nigh unto Him. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty and of mercy that hath preceded earth and heaven. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nWe have sent down, in the nights and days, that which hath enraptured the Concourse on High, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: By God's life! That which ye possess shall profit you not. Soon shall ye behold the recompense of your deeds. Fear ye God, O people, and be not of those who turn aside. The Hour hath come and the gates of hell have been opened. This is what ye were promised in God's Books, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the Wronged One spoken as a grace from His presence. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Hearken unto God's counsel, for it shall profit you in all His worlds. To this testifieth He Who speaketh and will speak: \"There is none other God but I, the Single, the All-Informed.\" The light shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have heeded the Call and have said: \"Yea, O Lord of all names!\" and upon those who hearken unto thy word in this firm, mighty Cause.\n\nGod's grace is evident, His favor is present, His mercy hath preceded, His heavenly table is descended, His verses encompass all, His evidences are manifest. Yet vain desires arising from idle fancies have deprived the servants of the bounty of the ultimate goal and the mercy of the Lord of Glory. Glory be to God! A mere drop from ancient tales appearing from illusory souls is regarded by them as vast as an ocean, while an ocean of utterance, surging with waves of divine knowledge at its highest point, is considered by them as but a drop. What hath caused such heedlessness, that they are deprived of beholding the lights of the Sun of Truth at its meridian? Yea, O my beloved! By my Lord and thy Lord, these matters have arisen from deeds and pride. Glory be to our Lord, the Lord of the Throne and earth! He hath commanded us at all times, and counseled in the Psalms and Tablets, to show forth courtesy and the consideration which are characteristics of man. Therefore, we beseech Him, exalted be He, to unveil for them as He hath unveiled for us, for His mercy requireth pardon and grace. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous. O my Lord! Aid them to turn unto Thee. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nConcerning the two Blessed Tablets they mentioned, it would be most fitting and preferable for these to remain with that beloved one. Regarding what they wrote about that land, namely the land of Ta and its darkness, in truth the prevention of the effulgence of the light of utterance from the horizon of that city - the cause and reason in the first station and primary rank is exactly what that beloved one wrote. However, in view of the helplessness, petition and supplication of that beloved of the heart and the friends of that land, after being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, the radiant lights of the Divine Sun of forgiveness dawned and appeared from the horizon of grace. His is the bounty and the glory, His the generosity and bestowal, His the grandeur and majesty, His the kindness and favors. By the life of our Purpose and your Purpose, after this matter was presented, the waves of the sea of favor appeared in such wise that this servant was utterly unable to comprehend it. However, in that moment the heart was occupied with thanksgiving and praise that that beloved of the heart became the cause of this most great bounty and supreme favor. This is the station of a hundred thousand \"well done\" and \"congratulations.\" It is hoped that henceforth signs of awakening, consciousness and recognition will appear from all directions of that city. They will surely convey these glad tidings to the friends of that land, and this is the most great victory and all-encompassing grace. His Holiness Ismu'llah Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin and Jinab-i-Mishkin-Qalam, upon them both be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, were mentioned due to that beloved of the heart's mention, and greetings and congratulations were conveyed on behalf of that beloved one, and they and all those circumambulating send greetings. Whenever that beloved one is mentioned, those present seek favor, mercy and kindness. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nConcerning what they wrote about the fund for the Writings and contributions, after this matter was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, He said it was necessary for Varqa himself, upon him be My glory, favor and mercy, and after several minutes this supreme word was revealed - His blessed and exalted Word: \"Jinab-i-Amin should proceed to that land, consult, and act accordingly.\" The intention is that the request of that honored one should also be considered, and Amin had written something about this matter some time ago. End quote.\n\nIn any case, that beloved one is ever adorned with the favor, grace and mercy of the Purpose of all worlds. I convey greetings to the friends of that land. God willing, may they be assisted through complete determination, steadfast uprising and eloquent speech in mentioning, praising and serving the Cause, in such wise that its effects become manifest and evident in all regions. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty, He heareth and seeth and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. I mention the eyes and saplings of the garden of divine knowledge with most wondrous remembrances, and I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, for an everlasting eternal blessing for each one. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who hear your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat.\n\n=== END BH00028 ===\n\n=== START BH00029 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted!\n\nPraise befitteth and beseemeth our Beloved Who, through His pure and perfect power, created the heavens of utterance and raised them to such heights as to be sanctified from the touch of the profane or the comprehension of any impure transgressor. He adorned them with exalted, brilliant, and radiant suns, with shining and luminous moons, and with rising stars. He prevented the ascent thereto of the satans of impure souls and the deceivers of unclean bodies. He banished the hypocrites from ascending to the most exalted Concourse, from rising to the Ultimate Lote-Tree and the Furthermost Branch. Through His power He stationed angels of chastisement with burning meteors that no outcast might enter the pavilions of the All-Glorious and no exile might gain knowledge of the eternal holy court.\n\nHow sanctified is the station of His loved ones above the knowledge of created things, and how exalted is the rank of His chosen ones above the comprehension of contingent beings! Through the sovereignty of His eternity He hath ever been self-sufficient and through the dominion of His oneness He will ever be self-sufficient. Neither doth the acceptance of created things add any glory to the servants at His threshold, nor doth the rejection of contingent beings cast any shadow upon His courtiers.\n\nOne verse from the heaven of His oneness is a consuming fire for the hearts of those who hate Him and an illuminating light for the hearts of those who love Him. He hath tormented His enemies with the fire of rancor, hatred, tyranny and iniquity, and honored His friends with the light of truthfulness, purity, submission and contentment. How sweet is His consummate wisdom and how wondrous is His all-embracing mercy, that He hath opened wide the gates of the spiritual Paradise and flung open the portals of the holy and spiritual Ridvan, that He hath guided the nightingales of the garden of inner meanings to the rose-garden of eternal glory and directed the hoopoes of the divine Ridvan to the eternal Sheba.\n\nHe hath so abundantly bestowed the drops of grace from the clouds of bounty that wandering lovers have turned to their original shelter and hastened headlong to the gathering-place of the Beloved, that fallen lovers have taken wing to their spiritual homeland and attained the lights of the Beauty of their Beloved. He hath made the hearts of the mystics and those who have attained His holy sanctuary mirrors of all things, that each soul might behold its deeds and actions therein and imagine them to be the actions of His servants, thus recording the full account of its own condition in the book of deeds, heedless that God is aware of the secrets of hearts and is informed of the state of every deceiving enemy. Thus doth God reveal what lies within the breasts of those who have disbelieved and turned away, of rancor and hatred, that He might torment them with the fire of their own selves from this moment until the Day whereon the deeds of all the worlds shall be gathered together. And peace be upon you.\n\nAnd furthermore, in these days a book has arrived from the depths of hell from one whose name had not been mentioned in this realm before, though assuming a mighty name. Glory be to God! What calumnies he has heaped upon the loved ones of God, and what flames of rancor and hatred he has kindled! The one God is witness that no ocean can quench the fire of his hatred, and no physician can cure the malady of his heart. To such extent has Satan adorned his deeds that he has repeatedly emphasized each accusation. Say: Thus has Satan made your deeds seem fair to you and guides you to the fire which, through God's wrath, is kindled within your own selves. He has gathered every antiquated and meaningless phrase that existed in the world and mentioned them as a source of pride. I marvel greatly that despite God's grace having opened the paradise of inner meanings, and the clouds of divine knowledge and wisdom having been raised up, and wondrous words having encompassed the world, this rancorous one makes claims of love while he has not partaken of a drop from the holy outpourings nor received any fruit from the exalted divine Tree. For some time I pondered, and it was not fitting to send him any reply directly, for the wrongdoers have no way to reach Us. However, when it became known that these calumnies had been spread among the people in various forms and multiple statements - alas, how this wretch has been negligent in relation to God! - it became necessary to write a detailed explanation to the companions and loved ones of that land, so that Satan's deceptions might not overcome spiritual souls, that thereby might be distinguished those who walk toward the fire from those who walk upon the path of God, the Mighty, the Compelling, that the hater might be known from the lover and truth from falsehood, and that every soul might seek refuge in God from the evil of malicious souls and at all times remember their Lord, become detached from all else but God, place their trust in the cord of His favor, cling to the handle of His loving-kindness, hold fast to the hem of His mercy, and grasp the mantle of His bounty and generosity, that perchance they may remain protected from the fire of the souls of the polytheists. And verily He is the Deliverer of His servants and the Quickener of His bondsmen, and He has power over all things.\n\nAt the beginning of the letter it was mentioned that two messengers from this one had gone to that province and had forbidden people from the worship of God and commanded them to worship idols and false deities, and, God forbid, had claimed on behalf of this servant that the Bayan had been abrogated and its Mirrors were invalid and its laws had been rendered void. First, this servant has never sent a messenger to any land and has in no way had any cause or decree that would require a messenger or could be completed by an emissary. I have considered none to exist except God and His loved ones, and have regarded the enemies of God as non-existent. Nine years have passed since these servants, after all we possessed was seized, were expelled from our earthly homeland and arrived in this land with guards and escorts. And praise be to God, we regarded this abasement as glory and counted this poverty as the essence of wealth. We had no demands of anyone and expressed no needs to any soul. We manifested the Divine Cause with perfect steadfastness. We burned away the veils of concealment with the fire of divine love and raised the banner of the Cause in the heaven of decree, such that this wondrous bounty has become renowned throughout all regions of the realm and the Cause of this land is evident in all parts of the world, as all have heard. If anyone should deny this, they would be counted among those of whom it is said \"They recognize the favor of God, then they deny it.\" No support was received in any way from any of the friends, and these servants, by God's grace and favor, were independent of the help of all who are in the heavens and earth, dwelling in the cave of divine assistance and sheltered in the impregnable fortress of \"whosoever puts his trust in God, He is sufficient unto him.\" We purified the heart from the dust of earthly ones and set our course for the eternal nest. Enemies from every side, both internal and external, lay in ambush for these gazelles of the desert of oneness, and what snares they laid to trap these nightingales of the rose gardens of divine identity. They girded their loins with all determination that perchance they might prevent the moths of love from the Beauty of the Beloved, or deprive these nightingales of the garden of inner meanings from the branches of the Eternal Rose. Nevertheless, we never turned our attention to any direction nor sought any helper. Now what have such souls to do with messengers that they would send to anyone? And I know not how this person learned that those two individuals were my messengers. Say: If you plot, God is more severe in plotting and mightier in punishment.\n\nFor five years Mulla Ahmad came to this province from the one known as Letter Jim. Ask him how much love I showed toward them. God was witness to the state and observer of the conditions, that although I heard from them certain words that were contrary to the original nature and pure heart, nevertheless I preferred to conceal rather than reveal and spread them, and kept them hidden. I was bewildered as to what was the cause and reason, until gradually they increased \\[their actions\\] until they came to this land. And here perfect love beyond all custom and convention was shown toward them for the sake of God's good pleasure, that perchance it might increase love and purify and sanctify the heart from the dust of that which is displeasing. After this, the king returned and desired to take Mulla Ahmad-i-Kashi back with him, but he refused. This servant became aware of this and summoned the aforementioned Mulla, who made various excuses. Before long, two persons came - Mir 'Abdu'r-Rahim and Shaykh Hasan - relating that so-and-so had said: \"Why do you go to Baghdad? A moment here is better than five years in Baghdad,\" and other such statements were made. Upon hearing this, I immediately summoned them and strictly forbade and strongly prohibited the utterance of such words. However, all the companions had heard these words.\n\nBy God, besides Whom there is none other God! I gathered them all and forbade them, and concealed matters to such extent lest a new sedition arise. Then another person came with a message for someone, and likewise another person. In brief, every soul who came from that land mentioned something, and it became clear that all these seditions were due to people's departure from their earthly homeland to the divine homeland. Therefore, we sent back Siyyid 'Abdu'l-Baqi, who had been staying in this land, to that country to prevent people from turning towards this land, that perchance hearts might be calmed and the dark atmosphere of turbidity might be transformed into the morn of joy. Although such words should never flow from their hearts and tongues, for this land was not confined to this servant. By God! The Holy Spirit takes pride in the very dust of this land. The breeze of this land bestows eternal life upon dead bodies and grants everlasting existence. But it increases not the wrongdoers save in loss. Indeed, what business has the beetle with the eternal Egypt of meeting, and what portion have the people of the lowest depths with the exalted concourse? How can sheer ignorance set foot in the sacred heights of knowledge, and how can the essence of tyranny enter the fields of justice? By God! The very dust of this land is sanctified beyond the comprehension of the righteous, let alone the wicked. After all, has not the nobility of every place been through its Dweller, and has not the glory of every house been through its relation to God? Would that these people showed as much respect for the City of God and reverence for the Sanctuary of God as worldly lovers show for their beloved! If but a thorn from the garden of earthly beloveds were to appear in the gathering of lovers, all would smell it like a rose and sing to it like nightingales - how much more so for a land that belongs to the Beloved, or a place that was the site of His descent, presence and dwelling! Such is the state of earthly lovers. Consider somewhat the condition and words of those who claim divine love, how heedless they have become and what mockery and derision they have shown toward this blessed and goodly land. By God! If there were any fairness, blood should flow from the eyes, the layers of the liver should turn to blood and flow from the eyelashes. But none shall achieve this save those who have detached themselves unto God.\n\nTears flow from the eyelashes, yet none shall attain unto this save those who have detached themselves unto God, have tasted the sweetness of His remembrance, and have held fast unto the cord of His love. For several years certain among the servants desired to journey from that land to this city, but were continually prevented. Two years ago permission was granted that whosoever desired might be permitted and allowed. This is a matter which the Sovereign of Oneness had previously revealed unto the illumined Muhammadan heart, and He Himself hath called His servants to this land, were ye to ponder the verses of the Furqan and turn your attention to the mysteries of the Cause. He hath said, and His Word is the Truth: \"And God doth call to the Abode of Peace, and guideth whom He willeth to the straight path.\" If ye were to comprehend the allusion of these words, by God, ye would, in your passionate love of God and your longing for this supreme glad-tidings, proceed barefooted toward the divine precinct. Say: Thus have veils of iron been struck upon your hearts and a covering of fire drawn over your eyes. No good shall the wrongdoers find on that great Day.\n\nSay: O people! Life passeth swiftly as lightning, and ere long shall the carpets of hopes and possessions be rolled up. Raise your heads from the slumber of heedlessness and, placing your trust in God, stand firm upon the straight path of His Cause. Enter ye into His Abode of Peace, His mercy and loving-kindness, which is the place of everlasting security and the praiseworthy station of the Lord. Outwardly, the Abode of Peace is the land where that Most Great Light resideth, and inwardly it is His most firm and perfect Cause. Were I to expound this station, creation could not bear to hear it, nor could souls and minds bear its weight.\n\nConsider now that they show pride regarding a land which the Tongue of the Unseen hath Himself commanded and unto which He hath summoned all created things. This matter, so clearly set forth that it would seem nothing more explicit hath been revealed in the Book, they have failed during all this time to comprehend. The Abode of Peace hath seventy meanings, all of which are gathered in the Divine City. Thus hath God mentioned in the Book the decree concerning that land, despite those who have disbelieved, turned away, and are among those who hold not fast to God's strong cord and who walk in the paths of self, without God's good-pleasure.\n\nYea, these people have all followed destructive and imaginary paths. How can they accept or comprehend any meaning or matter save through conjecture and fancy? Say: Do ye believe in part of the Book and deny part thereof? Thus hath God taken from you the spirit of faith and forbidden you the meeting of that Day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAs for those two messengers he greatly mentioned in his letter - one was Siyyid Abdul-Baqi, whose details were given and about whom you may inquire directly. Should he mention aught contrary to what is recorded in this Tablet, it would become evident that the enemies speak truth. The other he mentioned was Mirza Mu??afa. This man dwelt for some time in this land, and since his relatives resided in Naraq and his journey and migration had been prolonged, We sent him back to his homeland. He bore no message whatsoever from this servant except a letter for His Honor the Letter Jim, which he was to deliver to him. Yet how many calumnies this person hath heaped upon these two poor ones!\n\nAnd this servant had given him no message whatsoever save a letter addressed to His Honor Jim, which was to be delivered to him. Yet what accusations has this person heaped upon these two lowly ones, and what measure of pride and arrogance has he displayed toward these two poor ones in his letter! Say to him: By God, the ignorance of these two poor ones is more beloved than what thou hast written, and their abasement more precious than that wherein thou hast taken pride. Humble thy heart that thou mayest ascend to the heights of glory. Relinquish self-glorification that thou mayest enter the pavilion of holiness and faithfulness. Bring forth naught but supplication and entreaty, for these two are bounded, and the holy precincts are sanctified from such limitations. And peace be upon him who heareth the Word and is numbered among those who are guided, as inscribed in the Tablets of Light by the Pen of Glory.\n\nAnd furthermore, regarding what was written about these messengers saying that the law of the Bayan has been abrogated and its mirrors and ordinances have become void - this is a newly contrived notion of human demons who, inspired by the promptings of their base desires, have manifested these schemes. Verily do the evil ones whisper to their friends that they may cast their vain imaginings into the hearts of the servants and prevent people from the divine path and the infinite holy fountainhead of grace. Such servants have always existed among the servants of God, and through such nonsense have people been tested - \"that He may try you, which of you is best in conduct.\" In all ages have such calumnies been uttered against God and His loved ones, and will continue to be uttered. This is among the ways that have operated among the servants, and you will find no change or alteration in His ways - so that it may become clear who follows God's Cause and who turns back on his heels. Through such matters is the brilliant morn of guidance distinguished from the dark night of error. Thus do We impart unto you from the mysteries of the Cause, that thereby may be strengthened the hearts of those who are guided by God's light and who are among the firm ones in their love for God. The one God is witness - and sufficient is He as witness - that if until today such an atheistic liar had appeared in creation, or if anyone's knowledge had ever recorded such - say: O wretched fool! For the satisfaction of your own self and the polytheistic souls, you have committed a deed that has no likeness, equal or peer in all existence. At this moment my tongue, my heart, my inner heart, my spirit, my body, my frame, my marrow, my bones, and my skin all testify that there is no God but Him, and that 'Ali before Muhammad is the Manifestation of His Essence, the Dawning-place of His signs, and the Revealer of His words. To this do the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise bear witness, and beyond them doth the Essence of the Unseen testify with His tongue, and we are all prostrate before His face. All that hath been revealed from Him is truth wherein there is no doubt, and we all, should He desire, act according to His command. Say: Hold thy tongue, O thou who hast calumniated God and His loved ones! Say not that which God hath not permitted thee, and be not of those who slander the Manifestations of the Cause and are not guided by God's signs. Say: Great indeed are your utterances in what you have falsely claimed with your tongue. Thus hath Satan made your deeds seem fair to you, and still you do not understand. Say: If you are in doubt concerning God's Cause, then bring forth a proof from Him, or an evidence from His presence, or a testimony from Him. Nay, by the Lord of the heavens and earth, they shall never be able to utter a single letter, nor shall they be capable thereof. These are they who, when God's verses are recited unto them, cast them behind their backs and mock at them, while they soar in the atmosphere of their own desires. Say: The kingdom shall pass away and naught of you shall remain, and then shall you be brought before the fire. Then shall you find for yourselves neither intimate friend nor helper, and God shall question you concerning your deeds in this vain life, while you shall be tormented in the abyss of His wrath throughout God's eternity. Say: Have you seen this servant or gained knowledge of his cause? How then do you attribute to him that which you know not? By God, the heavens have wept at your injustice, O vile one, and the garments of the people of the Kingdom have been rent asunder by your deed, O accursed one!\n\nThe garments of the people of the Kingdom are rent asunder by thy deed, O accursed one, and the pillars of existence have been shaken by thine act, O wretched one! Yet thou walkest upon the shoulders of the earth as though thou hadst committed no wrong, and thou laughest at what thy hands have wrought, while the spirits of Paradise have descended to the dust and recline upon the clay. Woe unto thee, O thou that hast turned aside from the Command of God! Thou rejoicest in thy deed while the temples of the spirits are clothed in garments of blood.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! Thou seest my condition and hearest my sighing and my cry, and beholdest my poverty and my need, and witnessest how the oppressors among Thy servants have encompassed this servant of Thine, to such extent that they lift not their hands from my head. Therefore, O my God, raise me up unto Thee, then cause me to dwell in the precincts of Thy great mercy, near unto Thy Name, the Most Exalted, the Most High, that thereby the hearts of Thy wretched servants might find rest. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThen the Herald called out from the midst of the heavens: \"O servant! We have heard thy cry and have numbered thy poverty and thy need, thy humiliation and thy tribulation. Fear not, neither be thou grieved. We shall sanctify thee from those who have disbelieved and attributed partners unto God.\" Thus have We sent down unto thee a symbol from Our Command, lest they should discover it who prostrate not themselves before the face of God.\n\nThou knowest, O my God, that I have claimed naught save pure servitude, and have called the servants to naught save Thy Supreme Self in the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted Self and the Light of Thy Most Glorious Beauty. For this reason did hatred appear in the hearts of those who disbelieved in Thy mighty signs, to such extent that they slew me with the swords of their vain imaginings. Therefore, O my God, seize them with Thy severe grip and Thy conquering sovereignty, and leave not a single one of them upon the earth, that Thy lands might be purified and Thy realms sanctified. Verily, Thou art He Who doeth what He pleaseth through Thy wondrous Command, and Thou art the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThese are the beliefs of this servant that have been mentioned. Until now I have soared only in the atmosphere of pure servitude, and have been commanded to naught but the plain of poverty, evanescence, submission and contentment. Hereafter the Command is in His hand and we have nothing save after His leave. He is verily the Mighty, the Exalted, the Beautiful. Let him who wishes accept, and him who wishes turn away. Verily my Lord is independent of you, of your selves, your deeds and actions. He is sanctified above all who are in the worlds.\n\nFinally, O servants who claim divine love, why do you remain in the wilderness of heedlessness and walk the paths of fancy, error, self and desire? Know the value of these days while the holy, eternal fragrances waft from the morning breeze and the soul-refreshing zephyr comes from the paradise of the Beloved. Come somewhat to your senses and purify and sanctify the illumined heart from the dark dust of baseless suspicions, that perchance you may attain to the effulgences of the Sun of Oneness and the outpourings of the Beauty of the Divine Identity.\n\nThe ocean of divine bounty is not always surging, nor do the clouds of infinite mercy always pour down their rain. The divine lamp is not forever kindled in the niche of eternal holiness. The time will come when the Bird of Eternity returns to Its original nest, the Eternal Beauty retires to the pavilion of heavenly invisibility, and the nightingales of the spiritual rose-gardens repair to their true, glorious nests. Then will the gates of the rose-garden be shut, and you will be deprived of both the beauty of the rose and the song of the nightingale. While time remains, strive with all your soul and recognize the value of this blessing.\n\nAfter all, the divine loved ones must manifest heavenly signs and befit eternal qualities. Don the robe of sanctity and detach your eyes, hearts and souls from all else, that you may behold another world and step upon the pleasant plain of the spirit. By God, if you hear the melody of this Bird with the ear of the soul, you will become detached from the world and all that is therein, and will set your hearts on naught but the Truth.\n\nCounsel has exceeded its bounds. Now it remains to be seen what the yearning ones of the divine court and those attracted to the holy, spiritual melodies will perceive and what portion they will receive. All this is through God's grace and mercy upon you, O people of the Bayan, if you desire to walk the paths of truth and rejoice in the paradise of nearness.\n\nO people of the Bayan, refine the eye of your hearts and illumine your breasts that you may distinguish truth from falsehood and not follow the suspicions of the people of hypocrisy - those heedless souls who have taken it upon themselves to prevent people through various schemes from approaching the shore of the sea of oneness, while outwardly clothing themselves in the garment of faith. By Him Who holds my soul in His hand, if one becomes somewhat detached from outward conditions, one will distinguish truth from falsehood as light from darkness, and will perceive the fragrance of truth from all directions. That is, if the sweet fragrance of truth wafts in the East, the detached seeker in the West will surely perceive it. Thus do We mention unto you some of the mysteries of love, if you would inhale the holy fragrances from this Garment and turn with the wings of detachment toward the Egypt of certitude.\n\nAnd furthermore, regarding your mention of Ezekiel in your scroll of deeds, say: How presumptuous are your words, how low your station, how limited your bounds! For Ezekiel would run through the streets of Egypt, crying at the top of his voice: \"Will ye slay a man because he saith, my Lord is God, when he hath already come to you with clear proofs?\" How can anyone be compared to that Essence of being? The very dust of His sandal is sanctified above the hearts of all others. In the end, he sacrificed his heart and soul, and with his face stained with blood, he returned to the Kingdom of immortality and the most exalted Pavilion. And as for the verse which saith, \"And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who concealed his faith,\" the meaning of concealing his faith was the mysteries of divine wisdom and the pearls of eternal knowledge which have ever been preserved in the treasuries of divine power and will forever be kept in the storehouses of His might. These have never been and will never be revealed except to those who are worthy. Otherwise, he never denied his faith in Moses. Rather, his tongue, his expression, and his very soul all testified to his love for Moses, and in Pharaoh's court he openly confessed, as is well known. But a veil of divine power was cast over Pharaoh's heart, preventing him from comprehending his words, even as today veils of fire have been cast over your hearts, and deafness from heedlessness upon your ears, and coverings of rancor upon your eyes, such that ye understand not what ye say and know not what ye do.\n\nSay: O servant, fear God and attribute not to anyone that of which thou hast no knowledge. Hearken unto what God hath revealed to thee in the Bayan, for it is the finest utterance and the truest word. What comparison is there between Ezekiel and the people of this age? Pass beyond time and its people until thou enterest the paradise of eternity and perceivest the station and worth of the Temples of antiquity. The non-existent can never attain unto the eternal, and nothingness ever flees from everlasting life. By God! If thou wert to become aware of but a drop of Ezekiel's love, thou wouldst comprehend his rank and station, and such a fire of his love would be kindled within thee that thou wouldst forsake the world and all therein, be freed from the darkness of vain imaginings, and attain unto the fountain of eternal life. Consider now the beginning of his cause and the dawn of his faith, when Moses, coming from the Sinai wilderness of divine love to the Egypt of eternal servitude, guided all people to the divine Tree of fire and the radiance of the celestial Hand. When Ezekiel heard mention of his true homeland and caught a fragrance from the holy spiritual breeze, immediately such a fire of the love of God was kindled in his illumined breast that no power of concealment, tranquility, patience, or composure remained in him. With the utmost zeal and devotion, he strove to manifest and prove the fire of the Divine Essence in the neither eastern nor western Tree. Although he was Pharaoh's cousin and held the highest esteem with that accursed one, such that the keys to all treasuries were in his grasp, nevertheless he did not withdraw from the truth for a moment nor seek to be heedless for an instant. And now observe how these people, were they to encounter the fire itself, would manifest hatred in place of love and would strive with all their might to extinguish it, pouring upon it such floods of doubt and ice of delusion that no trace of it would remain, unless the Hand of Divine Power were to protect it and deliver it from those who seek to quench it. Judge thou fairly: can such people be attributed to Him, or is mention of such as these befitting in His holy presence? Nay, by God, were ye to judge fairly in the Cause of God and were ye to be nourished by the fruits of the eternal Paradise.\n\nSay: O unjust scribe! Would that thou hadst devoted thyself as much to thine own concerns, expending thy time in purifying and sanctifying thine own soul and spirit, rather than wasting thy years on calumnies, failing to perceive that all mysteries are as clear as day in the sight of God. Hearken thou unto the counsel of this servant, pass beyond these realms and enter the realms of holy detachment. Make fairness thy guiding lamp lest thou remain in darkness, make trust in God thy garment lest thou be left naked of His grace, make remembrance of the Beloved thy companion lest thou be deprived of His bounty. Die to self and desire that thou mayest find eternal life through His love and enter the immortal Kingdom. What a pity that one who claims to love God should not, in a single day, detach his heart from all that is created, and should not, at any moment, turn towards the Sovereign of existence and the King of the worshipped ones. By God, no tyranny is greater than this, no heedlessness more profound. Thou art free to choose. We have completed Our utterance unto thee and perfected Our favor upon thee, so choose for thyself what thou desirest. Verily, God is independent of Me and of thee and of all who are in the worlds.\n\nSay: O man, fear God Who created and fashioned thee, and confound not truth with falsehood, nor light with darkness, nor guidance with error. Fear God, O concourse of the earth, and transgress not your station. And concerning the Messengers of God, speak not except of that which God hath permitted you, even as He commanded you not to liken them to any being, nor to ascribe to them any peer or likeness. These are among the bounds set by God, and none transgress His bounds save those in whose hearts is a disease and who are among those that derive not light from the splendors of Beauty.\n\nFirst, know that the account of Dhul-Kifl is not as you have seen in previous books or heard from your forefathers. Second, how can this matter be proven when measured against certain established principles which you and your like have transgressed in the Mirror of God, having displaced them from their proper station and placed them elsewhere without the leave and permission of the Sovereign of the Cause? For according to what has been mentioned, they have argued for the unity of the Mirror and attributed it to their own selves. Yet how is it they have written that Dhul-Kifl was guardian to seventy prophets? The Mirror, which is the dawning-place of the Prophetic Sun, must not exceed oneness, so how could there be seventy prophets--who are the suns in the heaven of mercy--existing in one age and time? Thus doth the flow of your pen belie all that your tongues utter, and thus doth God reveal what is in your hearts and make manifest what lies within breasts, if ye but knew.\n\nYea, unless ye follow the example of the false divines and affirm the existence of lesser and greater prophets, as is written in books and believed and confessed by the ignorant. Say: O people, seek even outward knowledge from the fountainhead of knowledge. Draw from pure, delicate, sweet, and flowing springs, not from rejected, turbid, brackish, and salty ones that are treasuries of rancor, vessels of envy, and ships of hatred.\n\nAnd furthermore in his letter he had composed boastful verses, ostensibly addressing Mustafa but in reality God knows their intention. Say: He knows what you proclaim openly and what you whisper in secret, your movements and your dwelling places, and all is recorded in a clear tablet before Him. Nothing escapes His knowledge and no matter eludes His grasp. He knows all that you plot today against the Cause of God. I swear by God that those possessed of understanding are ashamed to mention the boastful expressions written in that scroll. For example, he had rhymed vulgar terms like \"son of Zal\" and \"old woman's quilt\" and \"falcon\" and \"sparrow\" - such coarse and impure words that have always been rejected by God and the people of wisdom and ever shall be. Say: Have you not heard what the Dove warbled at the apex of immortality around the crimson sea in His first counsel to His loved ones and initial teaching to His chosen ones? He said - and His word is the truth - \"The wayfarer on the white path and the crimson pillar shall never reach the station of his homeland except through detachment from all that is in the hands of men.\" Despite the fact that that Essence of being and Manifestation of the Desired One commanded that hearts be sanctified from vain allusions and rejected suppositions, ears be cleansed from hearing malicious fabricated melodies, and eyes be purified from beholding transient words, still you gathered whatever crude and unworthy words existed in the world and displayed your learning, sending fabrications to the divine rose garden and dispatching mortal darkness to the holy immortal realm.\n\nHear from this servant, by God, that I have no complaint about all this hatred and rancor manifested by you. But how long will you cling to dark veils and consider following the self and passion obligatory? Soar from the dust of negation to the throne of affirmation, journey from \"We belong to God\" and return. In truth, if the fire of rancor was not ablaze and the banner of hatred not raised in your breast, and if your purpose was truly to inquire about Mustafa and others with no other thoughts or intentions, you could have asked two simple questions about whether what so-and-so said was true or false, so that an answer could be given and truth distinguished from falsehood. Not that you should fill so many pages with fabricated words. By God, those pages were wronged, for you made the place of the Supreme Pen's affirmation a manifestation of the pen of hatred. And We know that all this was not from you but from what Satan whispered in your soul and breast. Therefore, sanctify yourself and purify your heart from all else but Him and trust in God your Lord. Say \"God\" with your whole being, then leave those from whom you detect the odor of rancor to be drowned in the sea of fire. And I swear by God that if anyone from the people of the Bayan mentions abrogation of the Book, may God break the mouth of the speaker and slanderer. By Him Who holds my soul and being in His hand, one letter of the Bayan is more beloved to me than all who are in the heavens and earth. Woe unto you, O people of hatred! How do you slander the loved ones of God? Do ye not witness how We have sacrificed Our spirit and Our body in confronting the enemies, and at every moment We await the meeting with God, that perchance We may follow the example of those who offer up their souls and are martyred in His presence? Do ye not behold how We stand in the midst of the enemies, with life and heart in hand, ready for whatever may come to pass? Can he who openly confronteth the enemies, who sacrificeth at every moment his spirit and all he possesseth, who proclaimeth the Cause of God before the peoples of the world and concealeth not His Cause, be compared with him who remaineth seated in his house? Can ye not perceive?\n\nO thou who walkest in the paths of fancy and error, who wanderest in the wilderness of ignorance and blindness! Wert thou to be fair in the Cause of God, the mere blinking of thine eye would cause thee to rend thy garments, to run naked upon the ground, to cast ashes upon thy face, to eat dust, to find no rest in any place, neither to eat nor drink, nor to find repose, to groan in thy heart and cry out with thy tongue, to weep in secret and shed tears openly, to burn in thy liver, and not to be content with thyself until God hath forgiven thee for what hath flowed from thy pen, O thou who art proud before God and His signs and His proof and His testimony!\n\nBy God! Were such to be thy state, the fire itself would flee from the flame of thy self, O thou donkey, and the fire would seek refuge from the fire of thy being, O thou accursed one! May God protect us and all who are in the Bayan from thy evil and from whatsoever thou hast concealed in thy heart and thy secret thoughts.\n\nFinally, for what crime and what transgression hath this enmity appeared and these calumnies flowed from thy pen? Hearken unto the counsel of this compassionate counsellor, and return from the salt marsh of self to the shore of the ocean of the All-Subsisting, and from the fire of transient ignorance to the light of eternal knowledge. Though the counsel of the wise profiteth not the deniers and hath no effect upon those who turn away, even as fragrance profiteth not those with colds, nor a shining mirror the blind, \"and thou canst not make those to hear who are in the graves.\"\n\nAnd furthermore, it was written that the accusations which Mustafa and others attributed to the letter Jim are four. First, why does he call people toward the Primal Point - may the spirit of all creation be sacrificed for Him? Now judge fairly - would any swine utter such words, or would such blasphemy and polytheism ever issue from anyone's tongue? No, by God! These words are naught but an attempt to create complete sedition and, under the guise of faith, to stir up discord. Say: Do ye scheme against God's Cause? The hand of God is above your hands, and verily He is more severe in His scheming and mightier in His punishment. Another accusation is that the honored letter Jim sent the \"Garden of Holiness\" to the Most Holy Court. In any case, he mentioned such things which never existed, while many poems sent by the chosen ones and the righteous were all accepted without any objection.\n\nThe One God is witness that in this kingdom naught was mentioned save their praise, even though fragrances wafted from their hearts that were unworthy of them. Nevertheless, this was hidden with Him from Whom nothing is concealed, and naught was manifested toward them except loving words and friendly tidings, until everyone who came from that direction related such things about them that, by God, no lover could bear to hear. And if this writer of the scroll would be fair and enter the straight path of truth and sincerity, love and faithfulness, he would tell what he himself said and heard from them with his own ears, and would turn from the left of fancy to the right of certainty, and would judge fairly what was said and with whom lies the truth. By God, the lover is as distinct from the hater as the sun from its shadow and light from darkness, and nothing becomes doubtful to anyone unless they wish to make it doubtful to themselves. Their statements became well-known in this land. By God, after these sayings became known and these deeds appeared, some of the companions, without the permission and consent of these servants, made certain statements - and God bears witness to this and suffices as witness. And afterwards all the companions were forbidden and became quiet and silent. God is Most Great! No one intended to migrate to this land except that they brought from them such words and messages that burned the hearts of the Concourse on High and the beloved ones. I remained without spirit, heart, and life, and the survival of a soul was among my greatest perplexities.\n\nSay: O thou who art heedless of God's remembrance and burner of His loved ones' hearts! We are content with thy judgment in this matter, so ask those who migrated from there to this land, that thou mayest know that I speak no falsehood, and know that we have held fast to the handle of truth, and that thou mayest witness what God hath witnessed upon the Throne of Eternity, that perchance thou mayest be numbered among the doers of good, written by the Pen of the Spirit upon the Tablets of Holiness. Say: Ask thyself of the migrating souls, both those whose names were mentioned at the beginning of the Tablets and other servants, that it may become clear to thee what was said and what accusations were made against the land of God and His servants. Say: Is not this multitude of enemies sufficient, and are not these numerous hunters of the gazelles of the vale of faithfulness enough, that you too have arisen to inflict harm upon these Doves of eternity? O Lord! Pour forth patience upon me and grant me victory over the wrongdoing people! Make not haste, for divine decrees are in motion and descent, and soon you shall find rest. I swear by God that I have desired naught from the Truth except transformation, that this earth might be changed, so that this servant might be sanctified from all questioning, answering, and meeting. Verily He ordains whatsoever He is asked, and He is indeed near, the Answering One.\n\nAnd further, mention was made of the tribes of Moses and the Pharaonic Egyptians, yet never did he distinguish the living Moses from Pharaoh's Egyptian, nor did he differentiate between the Children of Israel in the lands of justice and the Egyptians in the realms of tyranny. Say: Open thine eyes, soften thy heart, and sharpen thy inner vision that thou mayest recognize those who have believed and migrated in God's path from those who turned away and waxed proud, remaining deprived of the sacred sanctuary. Then know that the tribes are now seated upon the carpet, reclining on crimson cushions, moving by the breezes of the Command in a space that God hath sanctified beyond the comprehension of all created things. They rejoice in the glad-tidings of the Spirit and delight in God's joy, receiving sustenance from the manna that descended from the holy heaven. They have crossed the sea of fire by God's might and entered the sacred Paran and majestic Horeb, and God saved them from those who were drowned in the sea of pride and tyranny. They soar around Paradise and warble melodies that cause all the Concourse on High to swoon. Thus do We impart unto thee from the mysteries that were inscribed by God's Pen in the holy Tablets.\n\nI swear by God that if thou shouldst catch a fragrance from the divine Ridvan, by God thou wouldst find no rest in any place, land, or city. But God hath forbidden this to all who turn away. Yea, the afflicted one is deprived and the fettered one barred. Say: By God, if thou knew what thou hast done, thou wouldst drown thyself in water, or cast thy body into fire, or throw thyself from mountains, and weep throughout God's eternal existence for having made thyself of those who have committed a grievous sin in the earth. Would that this distant and fettered one might be purified for a moment from the desire of self, that he might perceive the signs, proofs, and tokens of the Egyptian. Say: Thus do We mention unto you a remembrance of every matter, that perchance ye may find a way unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nAnd furthermore, you wrote that they intended to kill the Messenger. Say to him: By God, if divine love dwelleth in the hearts of Abdul-Baqi and Mustafa, they must surely kiss the hand of the killer and bequeath unto him their own possessions, that they may attain the draught of martyrdom and hasten to the holy concourse and the exalted companion. Say: Hast thou not heard how the Dove warbled upon the twigs of the Tree of Eternity, and how the Spirit sang with celestial melodies in the Most Exalted Paradise? O son of man! Wouldst thou prefer to die in thy bed, or to be martyred in My path upon the dust, becoming the Dawning-place of My love in the highest Paradise? Judge thou fairly, O servant! Let that body perish that seeketh not to welter in blood for the sake of the Beloved, and let that form be no more that shunneth martyrdom in His love. Say: Hast thou not read that \"verily the friends of God, no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve\"?\n\nConvey what hath been mentioned unto all the people and impart it to everyone. Regard not this matter lightly, but with all thy might and power aid the Cause and its followers. Be not heedless for a moment, for the devils are engaged with utmost determination and power in deception and machination. It was also mentioned that they had written questions and answers so as to cast doubt in people's hearts. Though it is not known who the questioner and respondent are, yet God hath reckoned the questioner and respondent as one soul, and He knoweth what is in the breasts, if ye but knew. Thus have We related unto thee stories of the Cause that thou mayest be of those who comprehend through the allusions of words.\n\nSay: O heedless one! It is as though thou wert mounted upon the steed of self, having let slip its reins from thy grasp, such that thou knowest not in what land thou walkest or runnest. Thus befitteth the wrongdoers the punishment of a grievous day. By God, thou art the barren one, for thou hast deprived thyself of God's mercy and of the grace which was observed dawning from the Dayspring of the Spirit at the break of light. And likewise are those who walk in thy footsteps and follow what Satan whispereth in their breasts, and who have taken the Samiri as their protector instead of God, and were gathered in the land of rancor and hatred.\n\nSay: O disputer, O opposer, and those who follow thee! By what proof have ye turned away from Him Who called you to naught but God, and risen against Him with the swords of your tongues and arrows of your idle fancies, after God had forbidden you from this in the Book which no falsehood can approach and which was sealed with God's seal in the treasuries of infallibility? By God, were the breezes of love to waft over your hearts, ye would sever your heads with your own hands in recompense for what ye have wrought in God's religion, and ye were written in the holy tablets as among the deniers.\n\nSay: O despairing striver, O deprived opponent! For what sin didst thou draw forth the sword of thy vain imaginings from the scabbard of thy desire, when thou hadst not seen Me, nor associated with Me, nor had thy letter reached Me, nor Mine thee, nor had I heard thy name, nor hadst thou reckoned what I was upon? By God, all this stemmed from naught but thine evil nature, O thou who associateth partners with God, who turneth away from His beauty, and who disputeth His signs! By the Lord of the heavens and earth, thou hast committed that which none before thee hath ever committed!\n\nO Earth! Thou hast perpetrated a deed the like of which no one hath committed before thee, and thou hast committed a sin which none before thee hath wrought, nor hath it occurred to any soul. We beseech God to requite thee for what thou hast done and intended, and thus thou art among those who have never inhaled the fragrances of detachment from the realm of divine unity, and have never entered the city which, by God's power, was spread behind the pavilion of glory. Furthermore, even assuming - God forbid - that Mustafa uttered such words from his tongue of ignorance, how was it proven that it came from this servant? By God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting! If such nonsense were to issue from anyone's lips - and the investigation of this matter did not require such lengthy elaboration, for it could have been determined with but two words. I praise God that while all were occupied in their homes with the desires of self and preservation of wealth and station, we, these servants, in a foreign land and despite the intensity of the enemies, gathered all that had been revealed from God. All was written in the blessed hand, bound, and some were sent to all regions. We preserved it with such hardship that none save God is aware or hath comprehended. One nobility of this land is that it became the site of this supreme honor and greatest station. Yet despite this, instead of rendering assistance or aid, ye have made and continue to make these accusations.\n\nBy God! I do not complain of you, for it behooveth you to do as ye have done and attribute what ye have attributed, even as did those before you who warred against God in His Cause, disputed with His chosen ones, contended with His loved ones, argued with His favored ones, denied the grace of those who believed in God, and strove against His path, even as ye have done with all your power and with all ye were capable of, and ye denied the grace which was showered from the clouds of mercy by God's power. By God! At this moment my heart melteth at what ye have done, the lamp before me weepeth, the pen trembleth in my fingers, and the tablet lamenteth in my hand at what thou hast falsely attributed to the servant, and how thou hast not been ashamed before God Who created thee by His command and brought thee forth from the water that was hidden in thy father's loins. And at the end of the epistle he had mentioned that \"our belief is that you and His Honor Jim are of the same station, and this we believe,\" and then he mentioned Moses and Khidr, concealing therein an intention. First, he hath spoken falsely and slandered his own self, and his pen and ink have given him the lie. Say: Thus do your own hands and pens testify against you, if ye but perceive. All his purposes, beliefs, love and hatred became evident from his book. Had he been blessed with the fragrance of love for God and His friends, he would never have deemed it permissible to make such false accusations against His servant. In this scroll he mentioned not one word of truth, nor any expression indicating kindliness. All was but a manifestation of love for His Honor Jim and hatred for God and His friends. Thus have We reckoned all that was from him, and his own hands bear witness to this.\n\nHis hands, His ink, and the Pen which God chastised with His finger for what it had improperly written in the kingdom, all bear witness to this, and thus does this Pen testify in this Tablet that it may serve as a warning unto all peoples. Secondly, by God besides Whom there is none other God, this servant hath borne naught but servitude, and hereafter the Command is in the hand of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. It would be difficult for anyone to accompany this servant in this station. Nevertheless, good God! In every letter sent to this king from those filled with rancor and hatred, mention is made of proof, saying that so-and-so spoke thus and when we asked for proof, he was unable to produce it. After all, from whom do they seek proof, and for what matter do they demand evidence? If they seek proof of servitude, it hath filled the horizons, and if they seek aught else, I have it not. Say: O ye who turn aside! Even if ye were to soar with the wings of idle fancy from this moment until the Day that hath no end, ye would never reach the atmosphere of this heaven. Therefore, O ye who are filled with rancor, perish in your wrath and in the fire of your own selves. God is well aware of what ye conceal today in your hearts. Say: Have ye forgotten what God counseled you in the Book and in all the Tablets, that should ye find a fire in the Divine Lote-Tree, ye should not extinguish it with the water of your rancor, nor touch it with your idle fancies? Fear God, O people of the Bayan, then be not disdainful of His worship. Ye have cast the counsel of God behind your backs and have not answered the call of God, and ye are of those who believed and then turned away, then increased in their wretchedness while thinking they had attained the countenance of guidance. Nay, rather they are those who have turned away from the beauty of God.\n\nSay: The example of what ye write and send to various regions is like unto those who wrote papers and hung them upon the House to refute the Truth by their words. Woe unto them and unto you for what they did and what ye do today. Say: God upholdeth the truth by His words and nullifieth falsehood by His command, and He rendereth void the deeds of those who have perpetrated calumny and sin, and He cutteth off the last traces of those who have risen against His servant without proof or evidence. Such hath been His way aforetime, if ye would observe in the horizons of the Cause. Say: O thou who turneth away! Hear My words and transgress not thy bounds. Descend from the ladder of self and passion, then ascend the ladder of equity and contentment, that perchance God may forgive thee and cause thee to enter the shore of His love and grant thee the fruits of detachment and make thee among those who rejoice at the glad tidings of holiness. We bear witness at the end of the Book that He Whom God shall make manifest is the Truth, there is no doubt in Him, and God shall manifest Him at the time of Mustaghath, and then ye shall turn away from Him. By God! Were ye to be in this garment, ye would not believe in Him nor in those whom He would send unto you from His presence, for ye would object to Him and dispute with Him concerning what ye possess, and ye would argue based on what Satan hath cast into your hearts, while He is sanctified above all that. He calleth unto you with the tongue of the unseen: \"Verily, there is no God but Me. O people of the Bayan, return ye unto Me!\" By God, I then wept at these words to such an extent that none can reckon save God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. It is as though I perceived His sorrow and all that would befall Him through your evil surmises. The curse of God be upon those who have wronged and continue to wrong without any proof from God or any beloved Book.\n\nI swear by God that this servant glories in the dust trodden by the blessed feet of that Most Great Luminary, and every tract of earth is beloved unto this servant, for it may become the place whereon that blessed Being walks. The very air hath become the object of this servant's desire, for He doth breathe it, and likewise all the waters of the earth, for He doth drink thereof. I yearn for all existence to become the focus of that Sovereign of the unseen and the seen. How excellent are the words: \"My ultimate goal is the ground touched by Her feet, and the throne of Glory is but earth whereon She walks.\" Yet I know not why such meaningless utterances have flowed from the tongues and mouths of these brutish common folk. Say: Hath God given you permission for this, or do ye forge lies against God? In any case, I have resigned all matters unto Him. Verily, we are God's and to Him shall we return.\n\n=== END BH00029 ===\n\n=== START BH00030 ===\n\nO Qa'in, Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God! 14 Muharram al-Haram 1304\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise, sanctified from all reality and metaphor, befitteth and beseemeth that Incomparable Lord Who brought forth from the Point the four pillars, wherefrom appeared the east and west and south and north. His helper is the Supreme Pen, and His hosts are whatsoever hath appeared in the Kingdom of Creation. The veils of the world concealed not His Manifestation, nor did the mists of the nations prevent His dawning. The Luminary of His Will hath risen from the horizon of power, and the Sun of His Purpose hath shone forth from the Dayspring of authority. He standeth before the faces of the kings of the world without veil or covering, speaking that which He willeth. The clamor of the regions is as the buzzing of flies, and the tumult of the horizons is as the barking of dogs. The might of Pharaohs deterred Him not from His purpose, nor did the power of tyrants hold Him back from His Will. He accepted the tribulations of the world for the deliverance of the nations, and bore earthly afflictions for their salvation. In the Tablet to the Sultan He saith:\n\nHis word - exalted be His glory, universal be His bounty, mighty be His utterance: \"It is evident to those endowed with vision and those who gaze toward the Most Great Scene that I, in most of My days, was as a servant sitting beneath a sword suspended by a single hair, not knowing when it would descend upon him - whether it would fall in an instant or after a while. Through all this We give thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds, and praise Him in every condition. Verily, He is witness over all things.\"\n\nThe hearts of the Concourse on High are set ablaze by these words, and the hearts of the chaste maidens of the Most Exalted Paradise are stirred by this mention. Not for a moment did He seek to preserve Himself. From the earliest days He was at the mercy of His enemies. Nevertheless, at all times He summoned kings and monarchs, divines and princes, jurists and philosophers and mystics with a clear and manifest Command to the Truth, exalted be His glory, and desired for all eternal life, everlasting rest and perpetual favor. But the smoke mentioned in the Book of God intervened, wherefore eyes were deprived of beholding the signs and ears were prevented from hearkening to the call of the All-Merciful. Man is bewildered, nay the world is bewildered, as to what caused this prevention and what brought about this veiling. Yea, by the Lord of all beings, the cause is but the recompense of deeds. They have forsaken the Sun of Truth and occupied themselves with vain imaginings. They have turned away from the choice sealed wine and clung to mere conjectures. They were worshippers of passion while counting themselves among the people of piety. Glory be to God! How long shall heedlessness endure and how far shall vainglory persist? And likewise in the aforementioned Tablet He saith \\[...\\]\n\nHe, exalted be His proof and mighty His sovereignty, says: The discerning one is not distracted by wealth from contemplating his final end, and the wise one is not held back by riches from turning to the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. Where is he who ruled over all upon which the sun did shine, who spent extravagantly and sought novelties in this world and what was created therein? Where is the owner of the dark-hued hosts and the yellow standard? Where is he who ruled in Zawra, and where is he who oppressed in Fay?a? Where are they at whose generosity treasures trembled, and before whose outstretched hands and aspirations the sea withdrew? Where is he whose arm was lengthened in rebellion and whose heart turned away from the All-Merciful? Where is he who sought out pleasures and plucked the fruits of his desires? Where are the ladies of perfection and the possessors of beauty? Where are their swaying branches and their lofty boughs, their towering palaces and their trellised gardens? Where is the softness of their soil, the gentleness of their breeze, the murmur of their waters, the rustling of their winds, the cooing of their doves, and the whisper of their trees?\n\nUntil He says - may the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation be offered up for His sake: Do people dispute while they themselves witness? Do they deny while they know? I know not in which valley they wander. Do they not see that they depart and return not? Until when will they raid and sojourn, descend and ascend? Has not the time come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of God? Blessed is he who has said or will say, \"Yea, O my Lord, the time has come,\" and detaches himself from all that was, turning to the Lord of all worlds and the King of all possibilities.\n\nUntil He says - may the spirit of all who dwell in the dominion of certitude be offered up for His sake: I walk, turning toward the Mighty, the Bestower, while behind me flow the tears. My weeping has intensified until it has soaked my resting place. By God, my grief is not for myself - my head longs for spears in the love of its Lord. I have not passed by any tree but my heart has addressed it saying: \"Would that thou wert cut down in my name and my body crucified upon thee in the path of my Lord!\" Rather, it is because I see people wandering in their drunkenness, not knowing. They have raised up their desires and put down their God, as though they had taken God's Cause in mockery, diversion and play, thinking they do well and are protected in the fortress of security. The matter is not as they imagine. Tomorrow they shall see what they now deny.\n\nIf the ears of the world were in truth to be blessed with hearing these mentioned verses, it would suffice them. They would gain some knowledge of the mention, utterance, detachment and tribulations of our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in earth and heaven. They would no longer be saddened by the events of the world. With sanctified heart, penetrating vision and attentive ear, as long as spirit remains, they would be occupied with the mention, praise and service of the Cause of the Lord of Names.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my Lord, my Creator, my Master, my Support and my King! Thou seest and knowest what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures. Thou didst create them for Thy knowledge and the service of Thy Cause, yet they have drawn the swords of hatred against Thy face and have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of Thy Paradise to lament, and the recipients of Thy knowledge and the sources of Thy commandments and ordinances to weep. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty to assist Thy loved ones and them that love Thee, and him who hath traversed land and sea, turning toward the lights of Thy countenance and facing Thy horizon until he arrived and appeared before Thy throne, and stood at Thy door, and heard Thy sweetest call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. O Lord! Write down for him and for those who have ascended unto Thee what Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones who have spent what they possessed in Thy path. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over what Thou pleasest and dominion over what Thou desirest. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Praised.\n\nAnd when thy letter, which was adorned with the mention and praise of the Desired One of all worlds, arrived - verily doth praise of the Friend pass over every land like the clouds of spring and the vernal breeze, giving life and bestowing freshness and verdure, conferring joy and renewal - after reading and becoming apprised of it, it sought the summit of inner meanings and was presented before the countenance of the Lord of Names, attaining the honor of His hearing. His word, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names!\n\nO Ahmad! Be thou prepared to hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He desireth to make mention of thee at this hour. The glances of the grace of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, have been directed towards thee. He hath confirmed thee in turning unto Him when every learned one turned away, and guided thee to the Path when the people were in manifest doubt. He enabled thee to leave thy home, turning towards the Most Exalted Horizon. Thou didst traverse the ways until thou didst arrive and attain His presence and didst hear the call of God, the Lord of the worlds, and didst behold that for which eyes were created to see and ears to hear His wondrous call. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty and be not of them whom sorrows overtake in the days of their Lord, the All-Merciful. We desire to behold thee content with what We love and accept, and to see thee among the joyous ones. By the life of God! He who hath ascended is, in truth, in an exalted station with thy Lord. He desireth not to return thither. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing. We have sent down mention of him in the Crimson Tablet from My Most Exalted Pen. This is a bounty from Our presence which cannot be equaled by what thou seest today in the hands of men. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Merciful, the Most Generous.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-before-Rida, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Lord of all beings, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below, and be of them that have attained. Thou hast indeed attained unto My verses, turned towards My horizon, held fast unto My cord, and clung to the hem of the robe of My mercy, which hath preceded all in the heavens and on earth. Let not the happenings of the world grieve thee. It is the abode of trials and tribulations, as attesteth He Who created the heavens and the Lord of Names. Soon shall all that is therein perish, and there shall endure that which hath flowed from the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Knowing. We have made mention of thee before, and at this time. Render thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nSay: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. Thou didst create me through Thy grace and didst manifest me through Thy bounty and didst enable me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy Self on a Day whereon most of Thy creation turned away from Thee and violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament and disputed Thy signs and denied Thy proof and Thy testimony. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the mystics and the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones, by the breezes of the morn of Thy manifestation and by the fruits of the Tree of Thy Cause and by the fragrances of Thy days and by Thy verses which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will for Thy servants, to draw me ever closer in all conditions to Thy most exalted horizon and to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen servants. O my Lord! I am he who hath turned towards the lights of Thy countenance and held fast unto the cord of Thy forgiveness and pardon. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the sweet waters of Thy mercy nor to deprive me from the ocean of Thy bounty. Wilt Thou withhold the poor one from the ocean of Thy riches? Wilt Thou keep distant the lowly one from the gardens of Thy nearness? I beseech Thee by the pavilion of Thy glory and the banners of Thy signs to ordain for me that which shall accompany me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Educator of all things visible and invisible. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Generous, the Most Bountiful, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering.\n\nHear in the Persian tongue, O Muhammad-Rida! Praise be to God that through the grace of the Lord of creation thou hast attained unto His signs and His pen, and hast been illumined by the light of His knowledge. Give praise to the Desired One of the world that distance did not prevent thee from His grace - outwardly thou art far but inwardly near. He is the Kind Bestower. The whole world was brought from nothingness into being for this blessed Day, yet heedlessness and pride have prevented all from hearkening to the call of the Speaker on Sinai. They are seen wandering bewildered in the wilderness of ignorance. The recompense of deeds has become manifest and has prevented all save whom God willeth. And ye have attained unto that which hath no likeness or equal. The Cause is in His hands; He guideth whom He willeth to His straight path.\n\nHis honor Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God and His grace, hath attained unto that which hath flowed down and been revealed from the Divine Pen in the Book of Inner Meanings. O Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory! Know thou the worth of this station. Convey My greetings to the people of God in that land. Say: I swear by the Sun of Utterance which shineth resplendent from the highest horizon of possibility that all are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and have attained His grace. Today is the day of remembrance and praise and the day of service. Deprive not yourselves thereof. Ye are the letters of the words and the words of the Book. Ye are saplings planted by the hand of grace in the earth of mercy and nurtured by the rains of bounty. He hath protected you from the tempests of polytheism and the storms of unbelief, and hath reared you with hands of loving-kindness. Now is the time for fruits and leaves, and the fruits of the tree of man have ever been pure deeds and praiseworthy character. Withhold not these fruits from the heedless. Impart them with fragrance and joy, with wisdom and utterance. If they accept, the purpose is achieved and life is manifest; if not, leave them to their vain imaginings.\n\nO people of God! Strive that perchance the hearts of the diverse peoples of the world may be cleansed from rancor and hatred through the waters of your forbearance and loving-kindness, and become worthy and receptive to the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. We convey greetings to all and give them the glad-tidings of the dawning lights of God's grace. O friends! Know ye the value of these days which will soon come to an end. At all times loving counsels have flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful. Blessed are they who have hearkened and acted, whom neither doubts nor manifestations nor various colors of these two days have prevented from the straight path and the mighty announcement. O people of God! Upon you be the glory of God and His grace, and the mercy of God and His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nPraise be to God! The Sun of generosity has risen and the Light of bounty is manifest. Such is the grace that it has encompassed the world. Glory be to God! This servant is astonished as to what cause and reason has prevented and deprived the servants from the eternal bounty and infinite mercy. This evanescent servant begs and hopes that the True One, exalted be His glory, will not deprive His servants and will adorn them with the ornament of awareness, that all may not be deprived of its existence and fruit. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is none other God but Him, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis servant is truly abashed in one respect, as the reply has been much delayed. Apart from this, for some time certain blessed Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of divine Will, mentioning all, both living and dead. However, due to certain matters, their dispatch was also delayed, and this servant's excuse has been and is acceptable to all, as in His presence I am occupied with the transcription of verses, as well as replying to letters from various quarters. If time were to be justly divided, you have received your share. Praise be to God! The grace and favor of the True One towards you and the loved ones of that land has been and is beyond measure. Praise be to Him! Thanks be to Him! Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.\n\nRegarding the mention made of the loved ones and friends, and the request for divine Tablets especially for them, previously some Tablets were revealed specially for some, and for others their mention has now been revealed in this servant's letter from the heaven of Will. God willing, may all attain and drink from the ocean of His bounty. Mention was made of Mulla Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. After being submitted to the Most Holy Court, these verses shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace. His mighty utterance and exalted proof states:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Answerer!\n\nO Muhammad! The Day has come yet the people perceive not, and the All-Bestowing has come riding upon the clouds to His destination, yet most people know not. The One Who conversed on Sinai has established Himself upon the throne of Revelation, and the Dove of Utterance has warbled upon the highest branches. The Promise has come to pass and God has come with manifest sovereignty. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs. Among the people are those who have turned towards, and those who have turned away from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Give thanks to thy Lord for this most great favor. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having remembered me in the prison of 'Akka and reminded me through the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty Message. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned towards Thee, turning away from all else besides Thee. I beseech Thee by the splendors of the lights of the Sun of Thy utterance and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. Then forgive me, O my God, through Thy grace and generosity. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. O Lord! Deprive not Thy servant of Thy sealed wine and Thy ordained Command. Assist me to remember Thee and praise Thee amongst Thy servants with spirit and fragrance. Verily Thou art my Goal and the Goal of all who are in the realm of possibility. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Aqa Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God. The Lord, exalted and sanctified is He, says:\n\nIn My Name, the Wronged One, in the Most Great Prison \\[...\\]\n\nO My beloved who hath remembered Me! We have remembered thee with such a remembrance from which the near ones inhale the fragrances of the verses of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Husayn! Hear the Call from the Lote Tree beyond which there is no passing, upon the luminous spot: verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty. We created the servants to hearken unto My Call and to behold My horizon, but when I manifested Myself they denied and turned away, except those whom God saved through His sovereignty that prevaileth over all things small and great. Thou didst desire to attain My presence and to stand before the gate of My mercy and to behold My most exalted horizon and to hearken unto the scratching of My Most Glorious Pen. Know thou with the eye of certainty that the Wronged One loveth the presence of His friends and loved ones, but the idolaters prevented and came between Me and My loved ones. Thus did their souls seduce them, and they are today accounted among the oppressors in My perspicuous Book. Grieve thou not. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me and made me recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy power and the Repository of Thy mysteries on a day wherein most of Thy servants have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony and that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the sun of Thy knowledge. O my Lord! I am he who hath acknowledged Thy oneness. I testify that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified above the mention of Thy servants and exalted beyond the recognition of Thy creation. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the limbs of all names have trembled and the hearts of the learned and the mystics have been perturbed, to aid me in Thy remembrance where neither kings nor subjects can hinder me. I testify, O my God, to Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty, and to Thy power and Thy might. Thou art He Who hath created all beings with a word from Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones, whom Thou hast made the emblems of Thy guidance among Thy servants and the banners of Thy remembrance unto all in Thy lands, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of attainment unto Thy presence, O Lord of all beings and King of the hereafter and the former times. There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous. And praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Ultimate Goal of them that have known Thee.\n\nAnd this was revealed for Jinab Mirza Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, who attained unto the transcription of the verses:\n\nHe Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon!\n\nO Baqir! Be thou ready to hearken unto the Call of thy Lord. He mentioneth thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison, the Station whereon the Ancient King hath established Himself upon His mighty throne. Beware lest the clamor of men prevent thee from the Lord of Destiny, or the veils of the heedless ones who, when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, placed their fingers in their ears, and when the Lord of all beings approached them, turned away and uttered that which caused the dwellers of the cities of inner meanings and utterance to lament. Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, beareth witness unto this in this luminous spot. Say: O people! Fear ye God and follow not the desires of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. This is the Day wherein the ocean of utterance hath surged in the realm of possibility and the dove of proof hath warbled upon the branches. Dominion belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is the speaker who hath spoken in praise of his Lord, and the ear that hath attained unto the hearing of His Call, and the eye that hath beheld His traces, and the hand that hath taken hold of His Book, and the pen that hath attained unto the transcription of His verses, and the heart that hath been adorned with the light of His knowledge, and the foot that hath hastened unto His straight Path. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon those who have clung to the hem of grace and held fast unto His firm cord.\n\nThis was revealed for Jinab Sadr, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Prevailing over all names \\[...\\]\n\nHear the call of the Lord of Creation! He has come with the signs of signs from the dawning place of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Powerful. Verily He attracts thee to the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein was raised the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and wherein the Tongue of Grandeur spoke while seated upon the Throne of Divine Evidence. Blessed is he who hath heard and turned unto Him, and woe unto every heedless doubter.\n\nThe Promise hath come, the Promised One hath appeared, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath been made manifest. He hath stood before the faces of all mankind and called all unto the One, the All-Informed. Among the people are those who heard and turned unto Him; among them are those who heard and turned away; among them are those who drew nigh, took and drank, saying: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!\"; among them are those who hesitated; among them are those who \\[wavered\\]; and among them are those who pronounced that which caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide.\n\nSay: O people of the earth! Fear the All-Merciful and follow not the desires of those who denied God's proof and evidence, and turned away from a Face before which the Holy Spirit bowed down in adoration. We have remembered thee with that which nothing in existence can equal. When thou hearest My mention and perceivest the fragrance of Mine utterance, arise amongst My servants with wisdom and utterance, and say: O people of all possibilities! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with such sovereignty that all who are in the heavens and earth cannot withstand it. Fear God, O people, and deny not Him Who hath brought you the kingdom of verses and from Whose Pen hath flowed the river of meanings and utterance. Arise from the slumber of vain desire, hastening unto the Lord of all mankind. Thus doth the Mother Book command you, a command from His presence. He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nBe thou articulate amongst My servants and mention that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Mine utterance, that the verses of thy Lord may attract them and draw them nigh unto a station wherein naught is seen save the light of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Bestower. Beware lest the might of the world hold thee back from the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity, or the doubts of the divines from the Possessor of all Names. Arise in My Name to serve My Cause. Thy Lord will aid thee through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the Exalted, the Bountiful.\n\nWe have caused thee to hear the eloquent tongue; We now desire to cause thee to hear the clear Persian tongue: The entire world was brought from nothingness into being for the recognition of the Intended One. When the Finger of Will rent asunder the veils and the effulgences of the lights of manifestation shone forth from the horizon of will, all were seen to be deniers and rejecters save whom God willed. Glory be to God! On the Day of Retribution the Shi'ih sect was seen to be the most lost among the sects of the world. They committed that which no oppressor had ever committed. In the early years they all arose in opposition, and later pronounced the death sentence upon His most pure blood. Reflection upon the deeds of that sect and their actions before and after is necessary. For years they clung to the idols of names and occupied themselves with cursing one another from the pulpits, while in their own estimation they considered themselves the most learned and exalted of nations. Yet when the Sun of Divine Testing shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of wisdom of the Goal of all the worlds, all returned to hell-fire. Now too the deniers of the Bayan are occupied with forming a sect similar to the Shi'ih sect. Say: This is the Day of God, wherein none is mentioned save Him. You must soar in the atmosphere of the All-Merciful's love with the two wings of trust in God and detachment.\n\nO Ali! We have mentioned thee in a manner that all the remembrances of the world cannot equal it, and We make mention of thee at this moment with a Word at whose revelation all signs have bowed down in submission. We desire to make thee hear My verses, to manifest unto thee My clear tokens, and to impart unto thee that which will draw thee to the horizon of My loving-kindness. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken forth in this Station which God hath made the Most Exalted Station.\n\nHearken unto My call, arise amidst My servants, remind them of My verses, and illumine their hearts with the light of thy Lord's utterance, the Lord of creation. Say: O people of God! This Day is your day. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and follow not those who have violated God's Covenant and Testament and have committed that which hath caused hearts to melt.\n\nSay: The gates of heaven have been flung open, the ocean of bounty hath surged before the faces of all the world, and the Sun of proof hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance. Fear ye God, and follow not every heedless doubter. Beware lest the ornaments of the world hold you back from the Lord of all mankind, or the might of the oppressors debar you from the Lord of all religions. Cast behind you vain imaginings, then advance with radiant faces unto the station wherein the atoms proclaim: The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all lords!\n\nWhen thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of My loving-kindness, say: My God, my God! Aid me to remember Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the mysteries of Thy Book and the stars of the heaven of Thy utterance, and by Thy Command wherewith Thou hast subdued Thy lands and Thy servants, to make me steadfast in Thy service in such wise that neither shall the ornaments of the world withhold me from turning unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, nor shall the clamor of nations frighten me, nor shall their might and power and dominion weaken me. Verily Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nO Abdul-Karim! We have desired to make mention of thee and to gladden thee with the bestowals of God, the Mighty, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Verily He remembereth His loved ones at eventide and at dawn, through the nights and days. Is there any with sight to behold the traces of My Most Exalted Pen? Is there any with ears to hear My Most Sweet Call? Is there any with strength whom the people of error cannot prevent from turning to the Self-Subsisting, the Most High? We have manifested the Cause with a sovereignty before which no sovereignty can stand, and We have called the kings and their subjects to the Dayspring of Light. Neither the might of the oppressors nor the wrath of the tyrants deterred Us. We stood before all faces and proclaimed: O people! The Self-Subsisting hath come from the horizon of power with the banners of signs. We counsel thee and those who have believed to perform such deeds as would attract the hearts of men, and to manifest such character as would illumine the horizons. We counsel you to fear God, which We have made the lord of all deeds. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto it, and woe unto every denying infidel. Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken in His Most Great Prison, as a grace from His presence, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Glory be upon the people of Baha who were not prevented by the turning away of the heedless from turning unto God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.\n\nThis was revealed for his honor 'Amm-'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God. He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabl-i-Rida! We have made mention of thy father who attained My presence, stood before My face, and heard My call, and We mentioned him at the beginning of My utterance, and We desired to make mention of his brother who was named 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar that he might rejoice in My remembrance of him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He maketh mention of whomsoever He willeth as a command from His presence. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Blessed art thou for having turned unto My Cause when My servants and My creatures who used to remember Me at eventide and at dawn turned away from it. Hearken unto My call from the kingdom of My utterance. Verily it draweth thee nigh unto the heaven of My mercy and the sun of My grace which hath encompassed all who are in the earths and heavens. Take heed lest anything grieve thee in the Cause of God, the Lord of all men. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast unto the cord of the bounty of thy Lord, the Creator of all possibility. When thou hast attained unto My verses and heard My call, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thy verses have attracted me, Thy clear proofs have stirred me, Thy separation hath consumed me, Thy remoteness hath killed me, and Thy distance hath destroyed me. I beseech Thee, O God of the world and Lord of eternity, by the Kawthar of Thy bounty and the Salsabil of Thy grace and the choice wine of Thy knowledge, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, and speaking Thy praise and glorification. Alas, alas, O Lord of all being! Alas, alas, O Lord of the throne on high and of earth below! How can I see myself at home while I hear Thy call from the direction of the prison? By Thy glory, O my Best-Beloved and my Hope! Joy and gladness have been cut off at the mention of Thy tribulations among Thy servants and Thy afflictions among Thy creatures. By Thy glory! Thy sorrow hath made the days of the sincere ones like darkest night and their life like a terrible calamity and a destroying affliction. I know not, O my God, my Lord, and my Support, what Thou hast ordained for Thy servant who hath laid hold on Thy cord and clung to the hem of Thy bounty. Hast Thou ordained for him, O my God, what he desired from the ocean of Thy grace and the sun of Thy generosity, or hath Thy Most Exalted Pen been stayed in this? If the manifestations of Thy will and the modes of Thy purpose have prevented it, then ordain for him from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of meeting Thee and attaining Thy presence before Thy throne. Then write for him, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, the best of the hereafter and of this world. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis was revealed for his son Muhammad, upon them both be the glory of God.\n\nIn the Name of the Peerless Friend.\n\nToday the Sun of utterance is rising and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness. Grace exists and mercy is evident. Verses are being revealed and clear proofs are manifest. Blessed is the soul that has attained thereunto and whom neither the perishable things of the world nor the lash of the wrath of rulers has kept back from the Lord of all beings. He is not content with the two fleeting days of earthly life, for his gaze is fixed upon the Most Great Horizon and he seeks the Kingdom of the Lord of mankind's grace. Neither veils prevent him nor coverings intervene. O Muhammad, strive that perchance thou mayest achieve a deed whose mention shall endure in God's Book throughout the sovereignty of earth and heaven. Ye are all remembered in the Most Holy Court and have attained His grace. Beseech God that He may assist you to preserve what He hath bestowed. This Day hath been mentioned in the Books and Scriptures as the Day of God. Blessed is the soul that hath attained to His recognition and beheld itself detached from all else but God. Glory be to God! The Most Great Book is manifest before the eyes of the peoples, yet they remain occupied with this and that, and deprived of it. Say: It is not befitting to mention that which is created in the presence of the Ancient. Cast aside and take up - cast aside that which is with the people and take up that which hath come from God and is the cause of eternal life and everlasting remembrance. Praise be to the Lord of the world Who hath caused thee to attain unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen and hath remembered thee in the Most Great Prison. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and thy sister. Remember them both on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and convey unto them a command from My presence, and I am verily the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nThe ocean of mercy is surging, the heaven of grace is adorned with the stars of bounty. Each of those mentioned hath attained unto wondrous and sublime grace. May the spirit of the world be a sacrifice unto His bounty and His loving-kindness.\n\nAnd likewise especially for the honored mother of that one and the honored wife and the light of the eyes - upon them be the Glory of God. These verses have been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of the Lord of all beings. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nO Muhammad-Rida! We make mention of thy mother who hath believed and turned towards Me and attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen in this noble station. Verily My remembrance is a light that shall accompany her in every world of the worlds of thy Lord. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Blessed is she and blessed is every maidservant who hath inhaled the fragrance of the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. And We make mention of thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of thy Lord's grace. We have remembered every servant who hath turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon and every maidservant who hath attained unto the days of her Lord, her Creator, her Fashioner and her Supporter. Blessed be he and she and whoso hath held fast unto My firm cord. And We make mention of My servant and Habibullah. The Countenance of the Ancient Beauty hath turned towards them both on this night and hath revealed for them that from which the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of My loving-kindness and the sweet scent of My luminous garment. O kindred of Ahmad! The Wronged One comforteth you and consoleth you. All that is in the world cannot equal this. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, for this great bounty. Exchange your sorrows for the joy of My remembrance and My manifestation. By My life! Whoso hath inhaled the fragrance of My loving-kindness and attained unto the trace of My Pen, it behooveth him to cast aside all that is possible, rejoicing in what is with his Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken out of love for His loved ones. He is verily the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nFrom the attraction of the divine verses the world is filled with joy. All things at this moment are manifest and evident with the greatest gladness. Through God's manifestation a new life hath been breathed into all things. The pen and ink are powerless to describe it. To this beareth witness our Lord, the Commander, the All-Informed.\n\nAs to their mention of the arrival of the Divine Tablets and likewise the joy of all at these resplendent verses, praise be to God, the gaze of favor hath repeatedly turned in that direction. Again mention of each one hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur - blessed and happy are ye! The mention of another brother hath in this hour flowed and been revealed from the Pen of the Lord of Destiny. His words, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Husayn, who ascended unto the Supreme Companion in the days of his Lord, the Lord of all beings. Say: Light be upon thee and glory be upon thee, O thou who hast attained unto the most exalted station through thy mention flowing from the tongue of thy Lord on this darksome night. I testify that thou hast attained unto My mercy which hath preceded all and My favor which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth. We beseech God to send down upon thee at every moment a mercy from His presence, a blessing from His side, and a table spread from His direction. Verily He is the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nPraise be to God, especially for him hath been revealed that which in this hour is a fresh mercy and a boundless blessing descended from the heaven of generosity upon him. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Generous, the All-Bountiful. Nothing escapeth His knowledge and the events of the world and the opposition of the nations cannot prevent His outpouring. He hath ordained and will ordain for His loved ones that which none hath comprehended save His Own Self, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nAnd likewise mention was made of that honored brother, His Honor 'Ali, upon him be the glory of God. The gaze of grace turned toward him and these verses were revealed from the heaven of utterance. His words, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Knowing\n\nO 'Ali! All the peoples of the world have been and are awaiting the manifestation of Truth, exalted be His glory. How many edifices have been raised in His name and how many souls have been occupied with His remembrance and praise throughout the nights and days. Yet when the door of meeting was opened and the sea of reunion surged and the Promised Countenance appeared, all were prevented save whom thy Lord willed. And thou art adorned with His love and illumined with the light of His recognition. Give thanks that the Purpose of all the worlds assisted thee and aided thee until thou didst attain unto this most exalted station. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nThey made mention of the loved ones of Sarchah. Each one attained unto that which hath been and shall be peerless. The world and its ornaments cannot compare with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the soul that hath attained thereunto - such a one shall be distinguished from all others in all the divine worlds. Exalted is God, our Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne and the Lord of the exalted seat.\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven, for him who was named His Honor Haji-Baqir, upon him be the glory of God. His words, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nO Baqir! The Promised One hath come yet the people know not, and the Hidden One hath appeared yet most of the people perceive not. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty. The earth hath shone with the light of her Lord. Blessed is he who hath attained unto Him and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. The servant present hath brought a leaf whereon was thy name. We have mentioned thee as a favor from Us that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Mulla Ghulam-Rida! The Lord of all beings maketh mention of thee with that which shall draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Forgiving. We have sent down the Book, yet the people understand not. We have revealed clear proofs, yet most of the people see them not. They have followed their vain desires and cast the command of their Lord behind their backs. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they remain this day in ignorance. Aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the Protector over what hath been and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath attained in this Day unto a word from His presence. Woe unto every heedless one who is rejected. The Most Great Ocean hath surged before the faces of the world, as attesteth He Who proclaimeth in every matter that there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Lord of all existence.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Aqa Baba and remind him of Our verses and give him the glad-tidings of Our favors, that he may speak amongst the servants in praise of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. Be thou vocal in the remembrance of thy Lord, steadfast in service to His Cause, and hold fast unto His firm cord. Beware lest the cawing of the divines who have turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds, deter thee. And beware lest the might of the oppressors frighten thee. Say: By God! He Who was hidden hath appeared and He Who was promised hath come. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and be not of the heedless ones. This is the Day whereon your Lord calleth you and summoneth you to the horizon of His Cause, if ye be of them that know. Say: Adorn your hearts with the ornament of the fear of God and your heads with the crown of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Informed. Thus hath the fragrance of utterance wafted throughout all possibility and the ocean of knowledge surged. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto the Most Great Name. He is indeed of the people of this glorious station.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Husayn that he may remember his Lord and be of the thankful ones. Hear the call from the Ultimate Lote-Tree raised up in the Most Exalted Paradise: Verily there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is the Day whereon He Who conversed with God is established upon the throne of Revelation, and the Point of the Bayan calleth out from the right hand of the Throne: O people of the Bayan! The All-Merciful hath come from the horizon of power, whereby the eyes of them that are nigh unto God have been solaced. Say: Beware lest the doubts of men debar you from the Most Great Scene, or the veils of them who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment conceal you. This is the Day whereon the earth hath revealed her treasures, and the seas their pearls, and the heavens their suns and moons. Behold, and be not of them that deny. Say: Do ye know Who calleth unto you, and do ye recognize Who maketh mention of you from His mighty Prison? By God! Were they to know, they would cast away all else, turning with their hearts unto God, the Mighty, the Praised. Their vain desires have prevented them from turning to the lights of the Countenance. They are indeed among the most lost ones in My wondrous Book. When thou dost inhale the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know Thee!\n\nO Muhammad-Hasan! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from those who have turned away from the All-Merciful and committed that which hath caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament, and them who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. When thou art intoxicated with the wine of Mine utterance and attracted by the breezes of Mine exposition, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison and guided me to Thy path, O Lord of all worlds, and caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and the crimson of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and shown me Thy greatest signs. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause before which all creation hath bowed down, and by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all things, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause, to remember Thee amongst Thy servants, and to arise to serve Thee. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by them who have soared on the wings of longing in the atmosphere of Thy love and have spent all they possessed in Thy path, to ordain through Thy Most Exalted Pen for Thy loved ones the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nO Mulla Ahmad! The Wronged One makes mention of thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord and be of them that have spoken in His remembrance and praise and have arisen to serve His mighty and wise Cause. Thou wert mentioned before the Face aforetime, and at this hour I give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this manifest bounty. Remember My servants on My behalf. Say: Fear ye God and be not of the losers. We counsel all in the world to trustworthiness and godliness and that whereby their stations may be exalted. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Counsellor. O My loved ones! Aid Me through deeds and goodly character. Soon shall pass away what ye possess and what the kings possess, and there shall endure for you what hath been sent down from My Most Sweet Pen. To this testifieth every seeing sage. The earth and heaven have been illumined with the lights of the Face, yet most of the people are wrapped in thick veils. When thou drinkest the choice wine of revelation and art seized by the rapture of the Cause, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward the lights of the Luminary of Thy utterance and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst adorn the unseen with the ornament of being, and didst manifest the gift of Thy knowledge, and didst send down the table of Thy utterance, to aid Thy servants to turn unto Thy most exalted horizon and to hearken unto the shrill voice of Thy Most Exalted Pen. O Lord! Thou art He through Whose grace all things exist and through Whose loving-kindness all created things have been brought into being. Withhold not the people of Thy kingdom from the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness, nor from the Salsabil of Thy revelation, the Tasnim of Thy inspiration, and the Kawthar of Thy nearness. Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth and in Whose grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful. O Lord! Forgive me and those with me, and those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs and have done that which they were bidden in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Single, the One, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nWe make mention at this hour of one of Our servants who was named Abdu'l-Ali in the Book of Names, and We give him glad tidings of the traces of My Most Exalted Pen, and I am verily the All-Knowing, Compassionate Rememberer. This is a day wherein the Balance crieth out before the Face saying: I am the All-Wise Distinguisher, and the Path speaketh, yet most of the people are heedless. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of inner meanings from the cup of thy Lord's bounteous favor. When thou art stirred by thy Lord's verses and perceivest the fragrance of loving-kindness and favors, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest the ignorant seeking the ocean of Thy knowledge, the hopeful the heaven of Thy bounty, and the seeker the seat of Thy throne. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by Thy clear tokens that have encompassed earth and heaven, and by those who have attained unto the lights of the Luminary of Thy leave and have hastened to the most exalted Summit and the ultimate Goal, until they stood before the gate of Thy grandeur and appeared before the throne of Thy manifestation and heard Thy call and drank the Kawthar of reunion from the hands of Thy grace, that Thou write down for me what Thou hast written for them, by Thy mercy that hath preceded all created things. Thou art He Whom neither disobedience can deter from the rain-showers of the heaven of Thy bounty, nor can sins withhold from the wonders of Thy favor and bestowals. Thou hast ever been supreme and transcendent over all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad-Qablih-Hasan, that he may inhale the sweet fragrance of his Lord's verses and be of them that attain. We have heard thy call and have answered thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. From the precincts of the Prison there hath been revealed for thee that which all the fruits and mysteries of the earth cannot equal. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. Beware lest the clamor of the divines debar thee from the Lord of all mankind. Cast away what they possess and take hold of that which thou hast been bidden by God, the Commander, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Invincible, the Ancient of Days. They have violated God's Covenant and His Testament, and have pronounced judgment against Him unjustly. The Tablet and the Pen lament this, as thy Lord, the Single One, the All-Informed, doth testify.\n\nWhen thou art gladdened by the Greatest Joy through the verses of thy Lord, the Sovereign of Destiny, say: My God, my God! My heart hath turned toward Thee, my face is set towards the lights of Thy countenance, mine eyes are fixed upon Thy horizon, and my tongue uttereth Thy praise. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne, by the mysteries Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, by the fruits of the Tree of Thy Command, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty, to ordain for me from the wonders of Thy generosity and munificence that which shall accompany me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO Ustad 'Ali! The Lord of Destiny hath turned toward thee from His Most Sublime Vision, and remembereth thee with that which shall endure through the eternity of His Most Beautiful Names and Supreme Attributes. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the signs of God, and woe betide every sinful impostor. The Day of God hath come, wherein none is mentioned save Him. Blessed is every one possessed of true knowledge who hath recognized and attained, and woe to them that deny! The Concourse of the Bayan have turned away from Us and opposed Us without any clear proof or illuminating Book. They have denied God's favor after its revelation and rejected this manifest grace. Hold thou fast unto My cord and cling to the hem of My mantle, and celebrate My praise amongst My servants. Verily thy Lord heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nO Darvish 'Ali-Qabl-i-Asghar! The Day hath come, and the people are perishing save whom God, thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds, willeth. This is the Day wherein the Light proclaimeth and saith: The Lord of all mankind hath come - He Who was treasured in the hearts of the Prophets and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Object of them that have known Him. By God! From the Pen of the All-Merciful hath flowed the Living Waters. Blessed is he who hath turned thereunto and drunk therefrom, and woe to the idolaters who have cast God behind their backs, clinging to what they possess of the promptings of Satan. Blessed is the strong one whom the tyranny of the divines hath not weakened, and the seeing one whom the veils of the wayward have not hindered. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of My loving-kindness, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the Messengers, for having remembered me in the Most Great Prison. I testify that Thou art the Sovereign of the kingdom of grace and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and to aid me to act in accordance with what Thou hast revealed from the heaven of Thy wondrous utterance.\n\nThe ocean surged and the grace of God, exalted be His glory, appeared at its utmost zenith. Especially for each of the friends mentioned did the ocean of utterance appear and the Clear Book was revealed. I beseech God that they may be enabled to read it and succeed in serving His Cause. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Supreme, the All-Choosing.\n\nOn the first day when the Ancient Beauty was seated upon the Most Great Throne in the garden named Ridvan, the tongue of grandeur spoke three verses: First, that the sword is abolished in this Revelation; second, that before the completion of a thousand years, whosoever makes a claim is false, and the year is a complete year - interpretation and explanation of this verse are forbidden; and third, that God, exalted be His glory, at that moment shed the radiance of all His names upon all things. This fourth verse was revealed later, but they said this verse stands at the same level as those three: that whosoever is mentioned before His presence, whether living or dead, shall attain unto the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity. Blessed are they that attain!\n\nMention was made of Mulla Muhammad-'Ali-i-Tabib, upon him be the Glory of God. After it was presented before Him, a most mighty and holy Tablet was revealed especially for him and sent, that his eyes might be solaced by beholding the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds. His gift of barberry bushes arrived in the garden. His reward is with God. The deeds of this day are regarded as the most excellent of deeds before God. Blessed is he who attains! This servant beseeches his Lord to aid His servants to do what He loves and is pleased with, and not to deprive them of the outpourings of His days. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nMention was made of Muhammad-Quli Khan, upon him be 966 \\[the Glory of God\\], who also took the initiative in sending pomegranate saplings. Well done to him! His mention was honored to be heard in the presence. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nI am the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nWe have mentioned every name that was present in the Most Great Prison. My mention is a heavenly feast, an enduring bounty, and a preserved treasure. Blessed is he who attains unto it, and woe to every heedless doubter. Blessed art thou, for the Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee and mentioned thee in such wise that thy name shall endure as long as the names of God, the Lord of lords, endure. Be thou vocal in the praise of thy Lord and steadfast in serving His Cause amongst the people. We created the world for My knowledge and service, yet when I manifested Myself, most of the servants turned away. Blessed is the ear that hath heard the Call and the face that hath turned toward God, the Lord of all who dwell on earth. When thou hast attained unto the proof of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me turn to Thee when most of creation turned away from Thee, and thanks be to Thee for having guided me to Thy path when most of Thy creatures were heedless of it. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the tabernacle of Thy majesty and the places which Thou hast made the seat of Thy throne, and by the lands honored by Thy footsteps and the cities wherein Thy call was raised, and by Thy Most Great Prison, to assist me in all conditions to do what befits Thy days and is worthy of Thy Manifestation. O Lord! I am the hopeful one and Thou art the Bestower; I am the supplicant and Thou art the Generous One. Ordain for me in all the worlds of Thy worlds that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis evanescent servant also beseeches God to decree for him the good of this world and the next. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nMention had been made of the spiritual kinsman Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God, son of his eminence the exalted one whom the Concourse on High visit. This servant wished to conclude the letter with his name. Praise be to God, they turned to Him and attained unto the Purpose of all the worlds. They saw and heard and repeatedly made mention of the friends of that land and its surroundings. Likewise, they sent to the Most Holy Court a page containing the names of the friends, and each one was made the recipient of divine verses. However, due to the abundance of writing, that which was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur concerning those souls was not sent. Nevertheless, this servant bears witness that they attained unto that which is peerless. In any case, after the mention of their names in the Most Holy Court, these words were revealed from the Tongue of the Purpose of all the worlds, exalted be His utterance: \"Verily, I am He Who speaketh from Mine All-Highest Horizon.\"\n\nO Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory! Thou hast turned to the grace of God and attained unto thy heart's desire. Preserve thou whatsoever thou didst hear from the tongue of grandeur whilst in His presence, and give thou glad-tidings of His special favours to the loved ones in that land. Say: O people of God! This is the Day of remembrance and praise and the Day of service. Deprive not yourselves thereof. It behooveth you to be set ablaze by the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree - a blaze such as would consume the newly-arisen lassitude born of excess moisture from the realm of possibility, that all may turn unto the horizon of the All-Merciful and attain unto that which is befitting. Say: Know ye the value of this Day. This is the Lord of all days, and deeds performed therein are the lord of all deeds. Praise be to God! Ye are illumined by the lights of the morn of His Revelation and have attained unto the recognition of your Purpose. Know ye the sacredness of this most great station and recognize its worth. That which hath befallen you in the path of God hath caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to weep, and mention thereof hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Holy Book. Preserve ye this exalted station in the name of God, the Lord of Glory. Erelong shall the fruits of your deeds, as well as their effects, become manifest in the earth. I swear by the light of divine proof that shineth and gleameth from the horizon of the heaven of the prison: if anyone should draw but a single breath for the sake of God in these days, that breath shall be recorded and preserved with God. Were ye to discover the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and attain unto your purpose, ye would hear from all your limbs and members, nay from every hair, the cry \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!\" Beseech ye God to aid you in such wise that the conditions of the world and all that the nations possess may not withhold you from the truth. Drink ye with utmost joy and assurance from the cup of the love of Him Who is the Goal of all beings. Soon shall all that ye behold today perish, and there shall endure for you this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone forth the Day-Star of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO people of God! Ahmad, upon him be My glory, hath attained the presence of God. We testify that he hath attained Our presence, and hath heard, and hath seen, and hath drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, and hath attained unto that which none among the peoples of the world have attained, save them whom God, the Lord of creation, hath willed. He made mention of the loved ones of that land, and each one hath attained unto that which the pens of the world are powerless to recount. Blessed are they, and theirs is a goodly resort. It behooveth all to be mindful of the kindred of the honored, accepted, and forgiven one, upon whom be My glory and My loving-kindness. The Tongue of the Ancient of Days hath spoken, after his ascension, that which hath caused the sweet savors of the All-Merciful to waft throughout all creation. Blessed is he who remembereth him in the manner spoken by the Most Exalted Pen. He is indeed of the people of Baha in My mighty Book. Glory be upon him and upon you, and upon those whom the clamor of the idolaters hath not deterred from turning unto God, the One, the All-Informed.\n\nPraise be to God! The light of loving-kindness hath appeared, and the river of mercy floweth, and the lamp of bounty shineth, and the sun of generosity beameth forth. There hath been sent down that whereof every letter is a manifest book and a wondrous bounty. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to him and to the kindred of His Holiness the Exalted One, upon whom be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and asketh from God, exalted be His glory, that which endureth and abideth. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Compassionate, the All-Generous. Moreover, these manifest verses have been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will, specifically for the handmaidens of God in that land, upon them be the Glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word \\[...\\]\n\nO My handmaidens and My leaves! Upon you be the Glory of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne! Praise be to God that ye have attained unto that which the learned and the wise have been deprived of, save whom God willeth. I swear by the light of utterance which shineth and gleameth from the horizon of the heaven of the Kingdom that all the world and its ornaments cannot be compared with the blessed word \"O My handmaiden\" which hath been revealed concerning one of the handmaidens. The men of the earth are deprived, while ye are the recipients of divine favor. Know ye the value of this station and occupy yourselves with praise and thanksgiving to the Goal of the worlds. Most of the people of the world, be they kings or subjects, men or women, have been seized with heedlessness. Ere long they shall return to their stations. The grace of God hath assisted you, His bounty hath guided you, and His visible and invisible aid hath supported you, until ye have attained and become the recipients of this most great favor, this supreme blessing and this mighty gift. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you! The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon My handmaidens in the cities and lands.\n\nIf, in truth, the ears of the servants were to turn to the Kingdom of utterance of the Lord of creation and become recipients of hearing, all would attain to the recognition of the Purpose, Who is the purpose of creation. The ocean of mercy surgeth for all, yet it is contingent upon these words: \"The most honored among you in the sight of God is the most righteous.\" This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to the honored ladies, the leaves, the chaste ones and the devoted ones of that land, and beseecheth confirmation for all. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon the steadfast and firm servants of God. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00030 ===\n\n=== START BH00031 ===\n\nThis is the Surih of Counsel for whosoever seeketh counsel from God, the All-Powerful, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Great, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.\n\nGlorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth unto the Prophets and Messengers, and Who now sendeth them down according to how people act in the religion of God. Therein is that which informeth them of the path of God, and wherein He hath detailed all things as guidance and a reminder for those who, by God's leave, shall enter the Paradise of the All-Highest, and He guideth them along the ways of deliverance and bringeth them unto the holy shore in the presence of God, the All-Protecting, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Letter Jim! Hear what the Dove of the Cause imparts unto thee in these days wherein the people of hatred and unbelief have gathered against Him without leave or authority from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. They desire to expel Him from the land even as they expelled Him before. Thus do We impart unto thee from the mysteries of the Cause, if ye be of them that are informed of the mysteries in the days of God.\n\nKnow thou that We have remembered thee before and now remember thee with verses that cut off the spirits of them that have disbelieved, yet give life to the unitarians who soar in the atmosphere of nearness and remember God with their inner and outer tongues. These are they who are nourished by the fruits of the Tree of the Spirit at all times, who think not evil of God, who speak not except by His leave - He the Supreme, the Holy - and when questioned about anything, speak not save after His permission. This is how We teach thee the ways of righteousness, that perchance the people may remember in the days of their Lord.\n\nWe have sent no Messenger except with clear signs, yet all were mocked by them. Among them was Adam, whom We sent with truth and settled in the heart of Paradise, in a valley unreached by those near unto God. We taught him all names and showed him the mysteries of the Cause, then sheltered him in the shade of the Tree of Paradise, if ye but knew. We commanded him to eat of all that his soul desired, yet forbade him the Tree of the Spirit - this is a hidden mystery concealed. This Tree sprang from the pure Spirit, and none should approach it save God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Manifest.\n\nWhen We found his desire thinner than a hair, We caused him to descend from Paradise and placed him on earth among those who traverse its paths. Then We informed him of a matter and awakened him to what he had done. Thereupon he lamented within himself for seventy thousand years, then fell prostrate upon the dust for seventy thousand years. Then he raised his head and cried: \"Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Have mercy upon me and take me not to task for what my hands have wrought. Verily Thou art the Forgiver of all things, the Merciful, the Mighty, the Feared. Forgive me, O my Beloved, for what I did before Thee, for Thou didst settle me in a station sanctified from all save Thee, yet I occupied myself with my own desires and grew heedless of Thy remembrance. Turn unto me through Thy grace and mercy, for Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\"\n\nThen We sent down upon him the rains of mercy, cleansed him with the tears of his eyes, purified him from all defilement, and made him of those who soar in the holy atmosphere. Thereafter We chose him in truth, made him a Prophet, and sent him to those who dwelt on earth to command them to justice and forbid them from oppression. This is what hath been inscribed by the Pen of Glory on hidden tablets of glory.\n\nHe said: \"O people! I am God's servant. God hath chosen me for His Cause and made me a sign from Him unto you, if ye would but know. Fear God, O people of the earth, and spread not corruption therein. Seek grace from God, the Supreme, the Beloved. Take none as your protector save Him, and commit not in your own land what God hath forbidden you through the tongue of His chosen one, that perchance ye may be gathered before God on the Day of Resurrection.\" Yet they turned away from him \\[...\\]\n\nDo not commit in your land what God hath forbidden you through the tongue of His chosen one, that ye may be gathered before God on the Day of Resurrection. Yet they turned away from Him, rejected His signs, and said: \"We shall not follow thee unless thou bringest us another sign.\" Thus did they turn away from Him and were among those who were dead within their own veils. Then after Him We chose His son and made him a sign from Us, and sent him to his people that men might turn their faces toward the countenance of God. But when he came to them with clear signs, they turned away from him and were of those who in all eternity had turned away from the Beauty's face. And when days had passed and nights had gone by, We sent Noah with truth and clothed him in the garment of the Spirit, making him a sign for those who desired to be guided. But when he came to them with Paran of fire and lights of the Spirit, they turned away from him, ascribed partners to God, the Supreme, the Beloved, and said: \"Thou art not sent, nor hast thou been guided by God's lights. Rather, thou art of those who lie upon the earth, and thou art naught but a deceiving impostor.\" They sought to slay him, but We preserved him from those who would ascribe partners to God. When matters grew severe for him, he performed ablutions with holy waters and sat before God in beloved humility, desiring to call down affliction upon them. Then We sent down to him the angels of heaven that he might be among those who show mercy, and they descended upon him and said: \"O Noah, deal not with them as they have dealt with thee. Have mercy upon them and take them not to task for their rebellion, for they are weak upon the earth and poor in the kingdom, possessing neither death nor life nor resurrection for themselves. Be patient in God's Cause, for He shall fully reward those who are patient and who trust in their Lord. This is the first affliction to descend upon the earth, so be patient with their tyranny and persecution. God shall reward thee with the recompense of those who are patient in His good-pleasure.\" And Noah arose from his place and desisted from what he had intended. Thereafter he called them unto God, the Supreme, the Beloved. Thus did Our mercy precede all things and Our grace encompass all who are in the heavens and earth, would ye but ponder the mysteries of the Cause. Years passed in succession, yet his people were not guided by God's guidance and were of those who in all eternity were not to be guided. The melodies of God moved them not, but only increased them in rebellion and unbelief, until Noah despaired of them and desired to call down affliction upon them and render them as scattered dust. Then We sent angels from another heaven who said: \"O Noah, be not the first cause of earth's affliction. Have mercy upon God's servants and overlook them and their misdeeds, that they may be guided by God's lights and then by His signs.\" So be patient in the Cause, then be steadfast, and be as an iron mountain in the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Beloved. And he was patient thereafter until a time and season had passed that none knoweth save God, as honored servants do testify. Yet they believed him not in aught, nor did they arise from the graves of their desires, nor were they gathered after the trumpet was blown, and thus were they veiled within their own shrouds. Then did God call unto him from behind the veils: \"None of thy people will believe except those who have already believed.\"\n\nAnd likewise were they veiled in the shadows of their own selves. Then did God call unto him from behind the veils: \"None among thy people will believe except those who have already believed, and grieve not for what they do.\" When he heard the call of God, his soul was stirred with longing and he raised his hands, saying: \"O my Lord! Leave not these people upon the earth.\" We answered his prayer and commanded him to build the Ark. When the Ark of the Spirit was completed through the Most Great Word, We said: \"O Noah! Embark therein those of thy kindred for whom the decree hath already gone forth, those who excel in the religion of God.\" Then did We cause the clouds of wrath to rain down showers of heedlessness, and We drowned all who were on earth save those who were embarked upon the Ark of the Spirit.\n\nThen after him We sent Hud, and made him a prophet unto the East and the West, and strengthened him with a command from Our presence, and made him of those who would enter the Egypt of the Spirit. He said: \"O people! Fear God and act not as those before you acted, for verily I fear for you the punishment of an appointed day.\" But they denied him and turned away from what had come to them from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, until We seized them for their sin and made them a reminder for those who would remember.\n\nThen after that We sent ?ali?, and We set right his cause and commanded him to bid the servants to pure justice and to remind them of the days of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. He said: \"O people! Believe in Him Who created you and sustained you, then caused you to die and gave you life, if ye be men of understanding. Turn not to the world and its ornaments, and fear God and transgress not His bounds. Have mercy on your own selves and exceed not the command of God, the Protector, the Beloved.\" They said: \"O ?ali?! We will not worship thy God, nor will we follow thee in thy words. Desist from what thou sayest, or we will surely stone thee and slay thee.\" And thus were they among those who transgressed in the religion of God. ?ali? said: \"O people! This is God's she-camel that grazeth in the holy land and giveth you to drink of the milk of wisdom. She will not harm you in aught. Fear God and touch her not with evil intent, nor follow your desires, if ye be men of knowledge.\" But Satan whispered in their breasts and they rebelled against God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, and persisted in their transgression until they hamstrung the she-camel without cause or guilt. Then did We seize them for their unbelief and for what they had earned.\n\nAnd after him We sent Abraham with the truth, and chose him from among Our servants, and made him a sign unto those who sought to attain the courts of glory. He said: \"O people! Fear ye God and believe in Him, and ascribe not partners unto Him on earth, and be not of those who turn aside from the signs of God. Be not heedless of your own selves, but turn ye unto the realms of the spirit, if ye be endued with perception, that perchance the breaths of holiness may waft over you and guide you to the shore of oneness, and cause you to hearken unto the wisdom of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved.\" They said: \"We shall not follow thee, O Abraham, in thy Cause, nor shall we forsake our gods. Ask thy God to send down upon us that which thou hast promised us.\" Thus did they speak and mock him every day and at all times. They sought to slay him, as though they had made the signs of God an object of derision, and they opposed the evidences and proofs of God, and were of those who were far removed from the shore of this grace. Until the matter reached such a pass that one of Our servants, in whose breast the fire of unbelief was kindled, and who was among those who were dead in the shrouds of their own selves, gathered the people and said: \"I desire to slay Abraham or burn him with the torment of fire.\" And thus did they plot until they lit the fire of unbelief and seized Abraham and cast him into the fire, cleaving steadfastly to their own idols. Thereupon We made the fire for him coolness and peace and a spirit and a mercy, and thus did We preserve him and thus do We preserve those who show patience in tribulation.\n\nThen after that We sent forth Moses with signs of a Glorious Beloved and clear proofs of an irrevocable Command, and We brought him to the sacred shore in the Spot of Paradise, and We sheltered him on the Sinai of the Command and the Horeb of the Spirit. Then We called unto him from behind seventy thousand veils from the Lote-Tree of Eternity in the Crimson Sea of Grandeur: \"O Moses! Verily, I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers, Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob. This is My Beauty which We have unveiled to thee; behold then what thou dost see.\" And thereby did We bestow Our favor upon thee and perfect Our blessing unto thee. Then draw thou near unto this Fire that perchance the people may be enkindled with the fire of love in the days of God. Then We assisted him with a rod from the Command and made his hand Our hand and caused him to shine forth with the truth. Then We made him a brilliant light for those who behold with the vision of God. Then We commanded him to remind them of My days after a time wherein the veils would be consumed by a power from Us and the Countenance of the Spirit would come in clouds of light with a name sublime, if ye be of those who perceive. Go thou unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, then guide them with the lights of holiness and inform them of the days wherein all shall be present in the holy presence, that they may follow the command of their Lord and be guided by the fire of God and turn toward the shore of grace in the presence of God, the Supreme, the Beloved. And he went in unto Pharaoh and said: \"Fear God and follow not thy desire, and be not of those who are not guided by the lights of God. Verily I have come unto thee from the dawning-place of the Spirit with a Sinai from the Command, so follow the command of thy Lord and be not of those who are not enkindled with the fire of God. O people! Cling not to the cords of the ungodly but hold fast to the cord of God if ye perceive within your souls. Arise from the couches of heedlessness, then give thanks unto God in His days. This is what We announce unto you in truth if ye but know.\" Pharaoh said: \"Who is thy Lord, O Moses?\" He said: \"He Who created me and sent me with authority from His presence, if ye be of those who are certain - He Who created thee and provided for thee and gave thee of the treasures of dominion and granted thee sovereignty that thou mightest follow His command and be of those who walk in the good-pleasure of the Spirit.\" But Pharaoh remembered not any of the reminder and believed not in God for the twinkling of an eye. Then We drowned him and his chiefs in the sea of pride and made them a lesson for those who would succeed them in the earth and would ponder the signs of God. And when his days were ended, We sent the Spirit with the Spirit and We named him Jesus in the kingdom of earth, if ye but know. And We purified him from all that is abhorrent and caused him to hear the melodies of the Dove and We attracted him through a grace from the unseen and purified him with holy and beloved water and We breathed into him from the essence of the Spirit and We clothed him with the robes of prophethood and We chose him from among the servants and made him a sign for those who were created from the Word of God before and after and would be created. And We loved him in the Concourse on High before all who are on earth were created from aged clay. And We commanded all who are in the heavens and earth by His command and We took from everything a covenant concerning Him, and this is what was inscribed in the Tablets of the Spirit with musk-scented ink. And We raised him up through the breaths of holiness and made him a sign for those who rejoice in the paradise of glory. And We commanded him to bestow upon all created things a sprinkling from the surging depths of the enkindled sea which We graciously bestowed upon him in truth \\[...\\]\n\nAnd We bade him bestow upon all created things a drop from the surging oceans of the blazing sea wherewith We had, in truth, favored him - a matter none can comprehend save Our own Self, and which hath been preserved from time immemorial within the sanctuaries of might. And when the Temple of the Word was completed in its inner essence, he proclaimed: \"O people! Fear God and follow not the promptings of your evil selves. And fear ye the Day when ye shall all return unto God, your Lord. I call you only unto God and give you the glad tidings of the days wherein the Dove shall warble upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, if ye be of them that can hear - the Day when God shall manifest His Cause and speak unto you through the tongue of 'Ali, the Well-Beloved. This is the Day for which the holy beings have yearned, and none hath attained unto it save they who have detached themselves from all things besides God. O people! Make ye ready to meet God in His days, for this shall profit you more than all whereupon the sun doth shine, if ye be of them that are certain. O people! This is the Book of God - believe in it and pervert it not in what ye have been commanded in truth, if ye be of them that know. Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling, the Holy. O people! Hearken unto what We impart unto you of words of wisdom, and cast not the Book of God behind your backs, but respond to the Call of the Spirit, then kindle your lamps with this Light of Truth. O people! We ask of you no recompense, nor reward, nor thanks. My reward is with Him Who created Me and sent Me forth with truth, and made Me a sovereign over you that I might draw you nigh unto the holy court and guide you to the realms of glory, if ye desire to enter therein. But none among them believed, nor did they turn unto this resplendent and hidden Countenance. Among the people were those who denounced him, those who turned away from him, those who disputed with him in falsehood, and those who mocked him, until the earth grew strait for him such that no safe place remained wherein he might dwell. Thus did We encompass his affairs and reveal it unto thee from a holy and irrevocable Pen. When Our help came in truth, We did aid him with hosts ye could not see, and raised him to the heaven of holiness, and severed the hands of the infidels from the hem of his robe. Thus do We deal with those who show patience in Our good-pleasure. And thus do We impart unto thee from the mysteries of the Cause concerning what the hands of men have wrought aforetime, even as they work this day. Thereby know thou from the precedents of the past what was decreed for the Prophets and Messengers, that thou mayest be endowed with insight in the matter of thy Faith and be of them that shall enter the abode of peace.\n\nThe days and nights rolled on until Muhammad was raised up with the truth, and We caused Him to shine forth from the horizon of Batha like the dawning of the Sun of eternity upon a city of translucent crystal that gleamed and glowed, whereby the Holy Yathrib and the exalted Batha were illumined, did ye but know. Then did We raise up the clouds of bounty and caused the rain of grace from the Beloved to pour upon the cities of purity, that there might grow in sanctified hearts the plant of hidden knowledge. Through His presence We caused the doves of grace to warble, renewed the religions, and manifested all things with the adorning of spring in holy and impenetrable seasons. He said: \"O people! Believe in God Who created you and sustained you, then thank Him for His favors bestowed upon you, and be not of those who deny God's blessings. O people! I am but a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. I bring you glad tidings of God's good pleasure and warn you of the Day when ye shall be raised from dust and questioned about what ye acquired in your vain life, and shall be recompensed for what ye did. O people! I speak not from desire - it is but revelation sent down to me that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Praised. O people! This is my path, so follow it and follow not those who commit indecency within themselves and do what God hath forbidden them, and are immersed in their selfish desires. O people! I ask nothing from you, and my reward is only with Him Who sent me with the truth. Do not differ in God's religion, and follow not false divines, and be not of those who hope not for the meeting with God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. O people! Deprive not yourselves and your souls, but hasten to the paths of holiness on this Shore which none entereth save those who walk in the good pleasure of the Spirit. O people! Know ye the worth of these days, for the eyes of eternity have never witnessed their like nor fallen upon them. Fear God and transgress not against His Messengers.\" They said: \"Thou art but like one of us, and we will not follow thee in thy cause, and we see no excellence in thee, and thou art but a man bewitched.\" His people turned away from Him, and among them were those who said \"This is naught but a man who hath forged a lie against God,\" and among them were those who said \"This is naught but a madman,\" and among them were those who said \"Then cause pieces of heaven to fall upon us, or bring us angels, or cause a spring to gush forth from the earth, or show us treasures of red gold already minted.\" He said: \"O people! I am but a man like unto you. I deliver unto you the messages of God and speak not a word of my own accord, and God is witness between me and you. Fear God and let not the world deceive you with its ornaments and embellishments. Hold fast to the cord of God and transgress not His command. We command you only what I was commanded by God, and to this testify the atoms of all created things, would ye but hear with the ear of the spirit. O people! These are God's verses sent down to you - by what proof after them will ye believe? God hath ordained no proof in all creation greater than the verses, and these are of His verses. Fear God and be not proud before His proof. This is that which nothing in earth can resist nor can any in the heavens rival, would ye but perceive with God's sight in His days.\" They said: \"We will never believe in thee\" \\[...\\]\n\nNone can rival Him in all that is in the heavens, if ye but discern with the eye of God in His days. They said: \"We shall never believe in thee, nor in Him Who sent thee. Thou art but one who wishes to turn us away from that which our fathers worshipped.\" Thus did they recognize Him, and saw in Him none other than one of those who fabricate lies against God. And whenever We counseled them with the counsel of truth, they turned not unto it, until the fire of waywardness increased within their souls. They gathered together to slay Him, and consulted with the divines of the age, and thus did they scheme in God's religion. We delivered Him through the truth, exalted His Cause, and established the signs, despite those who sought superiority in the earth.\n\nAnnounce unto My servants concerning Him Who came with the truth in the name of Ali, and dawned from the horizon of holiness with the lights of the glory of the Beloved, and from Whose right hand flowed the rivers of the Spirit in wondrous hidden knowledge. He said: \"O people! The clouds of wisdom have been lifted up, and God hath come with His Cause - this is what ye were promised in all the Tablets. Fear God, then hasten unto Me. O people! I am the son of your Prophet. I have come to you with verses at which the mystics marvel, and this is from God's proof and His evidence - reject it not through your conjectures, but be fair within your souls. This is from God's law which He hath ordained for you in truth, if ye be of those who are certain. O people! By God, I desire naught but to reform your religions in all wherein ye differ today. O people! These are from the breezes of the Spirit which blow upon you and transform you from mortal death to eternal life, if ye but turn unto it. O people! The tree of knowledge hath borne fruit in this eternal Lote-Tree, and the Primal Point hath expounded, and the Word of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, hath been fulfilled. O people! Beauty hath been unveiled, and the veils have been lifted, and the Dove hath warbled, and the sacred Mount hath been illumined, and all within the heavens and earth have been enlightened, if ye but witness with the eye of the spirit.\"\n\nThey said: \"We see thee not upon the truth, and we find not in thy days what we were promised in the books of our fathers, and we shall not follow thee even if thou shouldst bring every sign.\" He said: \"O concourse! Fear ye God and look unto that which God hath made an enduring proof and a steadfast evidence for all who are in the heavens and on earth, if ye but recognize it. O people! All that ye await and have heard from your fathers and your divines is established through the verses, and these are from the holy verses that have filled all who are in the heavens and earth, as ye witness. If ye be not certain of the verses, then by what thing do ye find assurance in your religion today, and whereby do ye seek proof? The world and all that is in it and upon it shall perish, and ye shall be brought into the holy presence before God. O people! Let not ornate words prevent you from what ye have heard from your divines, and confuse not the matter for yourselves, and heed My counsel and the counsel of God - deny it not.\"\n\nThe more He mentioned the remembrance of God, the more they increased in rebellion, until all the divines pronounced judgment against Him, save those who had understood the ways of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. The matter reached such a pass that they gathered together to slay Him, until they suspended Him in the air and the hosts of unbelief fired upon Him the bullets of hateful oppression, and they pierced the body of Him Whom the Holy Spirit serveth, and Whose footsteps the denizens of the Supreme Paradise visit.\n\nThey fettered His body which was served by the Holy Spirit, while the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and dwellers of the celestial realm visited the dust of His feet and sought blessings from His sandals. At this did the eyes of the unseen weep in the pavilions of eternity, the pillars of the Divine Throne were shaken, the essences of being trembled, and the Tree was watered by His luminous blood that was shed. God shall soon reveal the mystery of this Tree and raise it up in truth, and shall sing: \"Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. All My servants were created for My Cause and all act by My command.\" This We have written for Our own Self in truth - that We shall elevate those who were oppressed in the earth and abase those who wax proud. We have sent no Messenger, Prophet or Guardian but these transgressors opposed them, as you witness today how these evildoers continue to object. The people in no age turned away except after their learned ones turned away and grew proud before God, denying His signs. Whenever they turned away, those who followed their desires also turned away. None believed except those granted holy insight, whose hearts God tested for faith, giving them to drink from sealed cups of holiness whose seal was of spiritual musk - these are they who are intoxicated with the wine of certitude from this cup. These are they upon whom the angels of Paradise shower blessings in the Garden of Immortality, rejoicing at every moment in God's joy. We have sent no Prophet but the clergy rejected him, exulting in their own knowledge just as today they rejoice in their learning. Say: O concourse of divines! Do you worship an idol of your own making while forsaking He Who created you and taught you what you knew not? O people of the earth! Reflect on the deeds of these transgressors, on what they earned before and all they continue to earn and pursue this day. Say: If this One Who has come to you with clear signs is not from God, as you claim from your seats today, then by what proof do you establish the truth of He Whom We sent before named Muhammad? Consider this within yourselves, O people of hatred, and be fair! Say: Do you rely on anything other than what We revealed aforetime to Muhammad of manifest and mighty signs? Say: O ignorant ones! If you depend on other than what was revealed to him from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, then bring your proof if you be fair in your souls or truthful in your claims. And if you have no evidence or proof save what was revealed of verses from the heaven of glory and love, then why do you not believe in He Who has come to you with clear signs that have filled the East and West of the earth, by which all in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, except those who were drawn to God's signs? Nay, by Him Who holds my soul in His hand! These transgressors are they who believed not in God's Manifestations and denied them after their souls were convinced, turning away from meeting God though they were all promised this in every tablet and hoped for it day and night. But when the promise came to them, they turned away and grew proud, doubting the meeting with their Creator and turning back on their heels until they pronounced judgment against God \\[...\\]\n\nThey turned back on their heels, until they passed judgment against God and ruled against the Manifestations of His Cause with whatever power they possessed. No Messenger was ever slain except by their leave. They rebelled against God in His days and transgressed beyond bounds against God, yet they perceived it not. Look then upon those who were on earth claiming faith for themselves, as though they turned to dust and turned away from the Lord of Lords, devoted to the idols of their own selves and desires. They take pride in those who claimed naught on earth save servitude to God, the True One, yet they fabricate lies against God their Lord. They traverse the wilderness until they reach the spot wherein is buried a name among names, yet they pass by its Creator on His earth and perceive it not. Among them is one who was named servant to this Name from which branched forth the oceans of names, as witnessed by the dwellers of the pavilion of eternity and behind them this hidden and luminous Pen. This is he from whose unbelief Satan himself flees, and from whose fire are consumed the hearts of those who have detached themselves from all save God and placed their trust in their Lord. He believed not in God for the twinkling of an eye. This is he in whose soul Satan whispered until he became heedless of the remembrance of his Lord and was expelled from the holy presence of the Beloved. This is he who taught Cain to slay his brother, and who was among those who showed pride at the beginning against God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. There is no unbelief, oppression, or wickedness but that it began with this wretched one and shall return to him, if you possess divine insight. The angels of Paradise in the most exalted company point to him with their fingers and tell one another: \"This is he who showed pride against God from time immemorial and opposed the Prophets and Messengers. Know him then and curse him, if you but knew.\" Therefore did God make him, despite himself, a servant to the letters of His Self, such that he repairs the wall associated with them while having passed judgment against them, glorying in this yet perceiving it not. Thus does God seize those who soar on the wings of passion in this atmosphere. Say: Fie upon you, O swine, for what your hands have wrought, drawing your sword against the countenance of God and showing pride against God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Holy. You imagine yourself among those who serve the family of God in their entirety, yet you know not of your sin which you committed in this vain life - a sin unequaled by aught in the heavens and earth, nor by all that was or ever shall be. You think you build their edifices and lay their foundations. Nay, by Him Who holds my soul in His hand! You have not built but rather destroyed the foundation of the House and demolished its pillars and obliterated its traces. The Tongue of the Unseen in the heaven of glory bears witness to this, yet the people do not perceive. You are the one who passed judgment against the Master of the House and its foundation, showing no shame before God, your Lord and the Lord of all things. You think you build it up, but this is an transgression from your wicked soul against God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Ask him, O people of the earth - do you not say that God has forbidden in His true Book that you wrongfully consume the wealth of others? Yet you hold back not from disobeying His commandments.\n\nAnd this is a transgression from thy wicked self against God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Ask of Him, O concourse of the earth! Do ye not say that God hath forbidden in His Book of Truth that ye take the wealth of people unjustly? Yet from His commandments ye turn not away in shame. How doth he who hath transgressed against God take the wealth of people unjustly, when his oppression is more manifest than the sun in the midst of heaven? Then with these \\[ill-gotten gains\\] ye build houses. We bear witness that the Owner of the House is innocent of you and your deeds, and curseth you for what your hands have wrought, were ye to reflect upon the mysteries of the Cause. We have heard that this accursed one boasteth in assemblies of his arrogance against God. Say: Men before thee have boasted likewise, and now they all cry out in the fire, finding for themselves neither helper nor supporter. Whenever they cry for sweet water, they are given naught but the vengeance of God wherewith He chastiseth those who have disbelieved. And thou shalt surely return to thy place in the fire wherein the idolaters are tormented. Say: By God, O thou who associateth partners with God, who turneth away from His signs, and who denieth His bounties, the denizens of the lowest depths of the fire flee from the fire of thy self and seek refuge with God from thee and from thy evil, and at all times they curse thee and those who follow thee. Say: Hath not God forbidden you to turn unto those who have oppressed and disbelieved, in His true words \"Lean not toward those who do wrong, lest the fire touch you\"? By what proof do ye boast of this transgressing libertine who committeth in his own self all that God hath forbidden and abandoneth all that He hath commanded, as ye yourselves witness from his deeds? Yet despite this ye draw nigh unto him, magnify him, show him reverence, praise him in your gatherings, aid him in his cause, and then unto him in your affairs ye turn. And this is the mystery of what was sent down aforetime unto Muhammad the Arabian in words of preserved glory: \"For all is there a goal toward which he turneth\" and \"Evil women are for evil men.\" This is the evil one who hath drawn nigh unto falsehood and believed in tyranny and disbelieved in God, and was of those who showed arrogance toward God their Lord. These ones pay no heed to what they have done and to their oppression in the days of God, yet they disbelieve in and curse those who oppressed and turned away before them, while they perceive not what they say, and they curse none but themselves, and their deeds give lie to their words in all that their hands have wrought. These are they who have disbelieved in God after having known Him before, even as they disbelieve today. Thus have We related unto thee from the true stories in these Tablets, and We have set forth all things in detail, as a guidance and mercy from Us to people who fear God, that thou mayest know all that hath befallen God's trusted ones and His ambassadors in former ages, lest thy feet and the feet of those who pass along the Path should slip. When at that time the Dove of the Cause was impassioned by the melodies of eternity and was attracted by the cooings of the Mystic Dove, it arose from the paradise of nearness and hovered between earth and heaven, and soared with holy wings in the atmosphere of this air, calling out in the atoms of utterance to the divines who appeared before or would appear thereafter until the Day wherein God shall come with His Cause and determine the measure of all things by His word \"Be! and it is.\" And He counseleth them and adviseth them with counsel that is better for them than the kingdom of the hereafter and the former life and than all that they know, that they should not place their trust in their learning, nor in their deeds, nor in all that whereby they were wont to judge \\[...\\]\n\nO concourse of divines in the Bayan! Let not your learning withhold you from your Creator. When ye hear the call of God, cast aside what ye possess and hasten with your inner sight to the court of holiness. Sanctify your souls and your spirits from all that ye have known and learned aforetime, lest aught should prevent you from God, your Creator, that perchance ye may be seated in the holy presence before God. For all these are veils and allusions that stand between you and the recognition of God, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Purify the mirror of your hearts on this Day, that perchance nothing may prevent you from entering the sanctuary of God, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved. Verily, if the mirror be covered with the dust of self and passion, no images and forms shall be reflected therein. Thus do ye witness in the mirrors of your hearts. Fear God, O ye divines! Let neither knowledge nor wisdom nor aught else besides them beguile you. On this Day, hasten unto the mercy of God, and sit not upon your seats disputing among the people. Whosoever hears the Call of God on the Day when He shall arise to manifest Himself, and delays or hesitates for less than a moment, shall render void all his deeds throughout his life, even should he expend all the treasures of earth in gold and silver, or worship God from time immemorial. Thus do We teach you the paths of truth, that ye may be nourished by the fruits of the holy tree in the days of God. Beware, O people of the Bayan! Rejoice not in your knowledge or your deeds, but in the knowledge of God. For knowledge is what He has expounded unto you from God, and deeds are what He accepts from you through His grace. Fear God, and wax not proud through your wealth. Should He pronounce ignorance to be knowledge itself, or injustice the very essence of justice, it would be the truth, and we all verily believe in this. There is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and shall not be asked of what He pleaseth, while all shall be questioned concerning all things in the presence of justice. Fear God, and be not like those who waxed proud before God, though they had all been awaiting His presence. The example of the divines who pride themselves on their knowledge in the days of God is like unto those who worshipped idols, for they clung to their idols while these cling to their learning. Nay, this is even worse, would ye but reflect within yourselves. Know ye that whatsoever prevents you from God, your Creator, is your idol, would ye but perceive it. By God! We have counseled you with the utmost counsel, and this is better for you than the kingdom of the hereafter and of the former times, would ye but preserve it. And thou, O questioner, read thou these Tablets with thy spirit and thy inner tongue, then share them with those in whom thou perceivest the fragrance of faith, and conceal them utterly from those in whom thou detectest the odor of hatred. Fear God, and be not like those who today follow the promptings of their desires and see not with the Most Great Vision, though they were commanded thus. They desire to extinguish the fire of God by which all who are in the heavens and earth were illumined, yet they perceive not what they did before nor what they do today. Hast thou not heard how the divines of the age gathered against Us this year, and We stood alone in their midst, seeking help from no one, until God dispersed them by His power and caused the light to shine forth in truth after they had all desired to extinguish it? Soon will God purify the earth from the defilement of such as these \\[...\\]\n\nWe sought the aid of no one until God dispersed them through His power and caused the light of truth to shine after they all desired to extinguish it. Soon will God purify the earth from the defilement of these people and exalt His proof and establish His evidence, and the earth shall be inherited by those servants who have detached themselves from all else save God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Then know that We have honored thee through these Tablets among the East and the West, and have made them for thee as a garment that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of the All-Glorious. If thou wert to place it upon the eyes of the inhabitants of the heavens and earth, their sight would be restored to them. Thus do We act in truth, despite those who mock the signs of God this day. Say: O concourse of the earth! These indeed are melodies with which no ear among those created from dust hath been favored, if ye be of them that are certain. These are words that no heart in creation hath comprehended, if ye would ascend to their stations in the heaven of holiness. This is a beauty upon which no eye in creation hath fallen, if ye would behold with the eye of glory. This is the Lamp of Holiness that accepteth no niche for itself and is content with the niche of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God! This is indeed a fire around which circle the denizens of Paradise, yet none have derived light therefrom save those who circle round the Tree. These are excepted only out of yearning for those who have attained unto the blessed Spot and who, according to their stations, are warmed by this fire, that perchance they may not speak out of their own desires and may commit their affairs unto God, and neither poverty nor want may grieve them, nor tribulation and hardship prevent them from the love of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: These words are maidens whom none in creation hath touched, who have remained chaste in their chambers of glory, and whom We have revealed from behind a thousand thousand veils that ye might be illumined by their beauty. Less than can be numbered are the melodies by which ye are attracted upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of these words. When the utterance reached this most subtle, most tender, most glorious and most exalted station, remember thy Lord with the tongue of all creation, then on behalf of all \\[...\\]\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! At this moment the tongues of our inner being bear witness to Thy unity, our lips to Thy singleness, our essences to Thy self-subsistence, and our realities to Thy oneness. All praise be unto Thee for the wondrous gifts Thou hast bestowed and the beauteous favors Thou hast granted, inasmuch as Thou didst send forth the Messengers from Thy presence and reveal the Books from Thy side, wherein Thou didst ordain the laws of nearness unto Thee and make manifest the pathways leading to union with Thee. Whatsoever ordinances Thou hast revealed therein are better for us than all upon which the sun doth shine, and whatsoever bounty or grace Thou hast ordained therein doth return unto us. Verily Thou hast ever been sanctified from desiring aught for Thyself or having any benefit return unto Thee. Thou hast ever dwelt in the heights of holiness, grace and riches, and wilt continue to abide in the exaltation of glory, sanctity and independence. All the wealthy are poor before the gate of the city of Thy grace, all the mighty are brought low before the court of Thy holy mercy, all sovereigns are but vassals before the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, and all existence standeth in submission before the revelations of Thy dominion.\n\nUntil at last Thou didst bring the Cause unto the Beauty of Thy divine Holiness and the Temple of Thy sanctified Glory, and didst manifest from behind the veils of power that which Thou hadst treasured from time immemorial through Thy might, that thereby the wonders of Thy grace might be perfected for the people of Thy kingdom and the gems of Thy loving-kindness for Thy creation. Through this Thou didst fulfill all that Thou hadst promised unto the detached ones among Thy chosen ones, and didst accomplish all that Thou hadst pledged unto the near ones among Thy trusted ones. Through Him Thou didst complete Thy proof, perfect Thy testimony, establish Thy evidences, and make firm Thy signs. Thou didst call all unto this Most Great, Most Exalted Bounty and this Furthermost, Most Remote Tree.\n\nAmong the people are those who answered Thy call, in whose hearts the fire of Thy love was kindled by Thy Word, such that they were consumed before they could even touch the fire of the Tree of Thine eternity. Among them are those who hastened to the shore of Thy nearness with their hearts, their souls and their feet, until they entered the stronghold of Thy meeting and arrived in the vicinity of Thy union and mercy. Among them are those who were wholly detached unto Thee, such that they dwelt in Thy habitations and settled in Thy lands. And among them are those who turned away and showed pride before Thee and rebelled against Thy Self, whom their own selves and desires held back from the path of Thy grace and the ways of Thy forgiveness, and the divines who drank not from the cups of Thy bounty and held fast only to the handle of their desires, taking these as gods besides Thee.\n\nAnd among them are these who have gathered in Thy land and taken refuge in the shadow of Thy supreme grace and Thy Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Complete, Most Sweet Name. In all this, O my God, the bounty was from none save Thee, and the grace was from none except Thee, without anyone being worthy thereof. For Thou didst remove the veil from their faces and burn away the veils that came between them and the lights of Thy beauty. Thou didst overshadow them with the clouds of Thy mercy and caused the springs of Thy knowledge and mercy to flow for them. Thou didst nourish them with the wondrous fruits of the Tree of Thy holiness, Thy generosity and Thy gift. Thou didst bring them unto such bounty that Thou didst cause them to know Thy Most Glorious Self through Thy Most Exalted Name, and didst illumine their hearts and eyes with Thy luminous beauty, and didst honor them with the meeting of Thy most resplendent countenance, and didst cause them to hear Thy sweetest melodies.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having distinguished them with Thine everlasting favors! Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having chosen them for Thy perpetual bestowals! Therefore, O my God, since it hath ever been Thy way to be bountiful \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled them to hear Thy most sweet melodies! Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having chosen them for Thy abiding bounties! Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having singled them out for Thy eternal favors! Therefore, O my God, since bounty and beneficence are Thy habit, and grace and favor Thy attribute, I beseech Thee by the yearning of the hearts of Thy lovers and the attraction of the hearts of Thy sincere ones - they who desire none but Thee and whose hearts have tasted naught save the wonders of Thy remembrance - that Thou cause to waft, at this moment, from the right hand of the paradise of Thy eternal holiness, the breezes of forgiveness, that the fragrance of disobedience may be removed from all creation. May all return unto Thee and enter the cities of Thy name and the gardens of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Thou art the Mighty, the Generous, the Merciful, the Self-Sufficient, the Giver, the Bountiful, the Bestower, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the All-Informed, the Helper, the Compassionate, the Forgiving.\n\nI beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name, the Manifest yet Hidden, by the Beauty of Thy unseen yet renowned Countenance, by the lights of Thy Face whereby all in the heavens and earth were illumined, by the splendor of Thy Names whereby all in the realms of eternity and the Throne were enlightened, and by Him Whom Thou shalt manifest in Thy days and Whom Thou hast promised to all Thy trusted ones and chosen ones in all Thy Tablets, that Thou gather us together at the fountain of Thy riches on the Day of Thy Manifestation. Deprive not our eyes, O my God, on that Day, from beholding the lights of Thy Beauty, nor our ears from hearing the melodies of Thy transcendent Unity, nor our hearts from the wonders of the remembrance of Thy divine Lordship, nor our souls from hearkening unto the words of Thy Self-Subsistence, nor our tongues from the gems of the praise of Thy Oneness, nor our hands from taking hold of the tablets of Thy divine Unity, nor our feet from walking toward the precincts of Thy nearness and eternity, nor our bodies from standing before the throne of Thy sovereignty and grandeur.\n\nI beseech Thee at this moment, O my God, that Thou make not this bounty exclusive to some rather than others, nor deprive on that Day any of Thy servants, nor strip any soul of Thy beautiful robe. For I observe at this instant that all things stand before the city of Thy grace and mercy, their very existence and forms bearing witness to their poverty, their need, their distress and their helplessness, though most of them perceive not this within themselves nor comprehend it in their own beings. Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! Though their bodies may deny the wonders of Thy grace and the gems of Thy bounty, yet their inner reality and essence beseech Thy favor and are submissive to Thy command. Who, O my God, can flee from Thy sovereignty, or escape from Thy dominion, or run from Thy power and might?\n\nSend down, O my God, from the clouds of Thy mercy the rains of Thy holiness and bounty upon them, and upon their hearts from the clouds of Thy generosity the waters of Thy grace and favors, that there may grow from the soil of their existence the ears of Thy knowledge and wisdom, and the grains of longing for Thee and Thy mercy. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Thou art the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful, the All-Powerful, the All-Generous, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Most High, the Forbearing, the Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent, the Beloved.\n\nAnd as to what thou hast asked concerning the ruling on traditions, know thou that for the wayfarer unto God on this radiant and luminous path, it behooveth him in these days to sanctify the mirror of his heart from all that he hath heard aforetime, for after the suns of knowledge and wisdom were hidden from them, the people differed concerning the Cause of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Some of them went astray and led others astray, inventing falsehoods against God in His words and the words of the family of God, speaking that which their desires commanded them and attributing it to the Suns of Infallibility - and they understood not. Others followed their rulers and supported them in whatsoever their souls desired, fabricating traditions and attributing them to the Imams of Justice that they might draw near unto them, and thus did they judge according to their vain imaginings. And among them were those who feared God their Creator in their days and followed the paths of truth and spoke naught but pure truth - and all this was recorded in the Preserved Tablet.\n\nAnd when days and nights revolved and matters proceeded and judgments were passed, differences appeared among the divines, and thereby true sayings became mixed with false ones, as ye witness in their words and observe in their deeds. Since the matter is as We have explained to thee, how canst thou distinguish truth from falsehood after they have all differed concerning God's Cause to such extent that thou wilt not find two of them agreed upon a single matter, and in all things they continued to differ? It behooveth thee and those who follow truth in these days - wherein all save a counted few have been veiled from God - to sanctify your souls and hearts from all that is witnessed and seen on earth, for ye have no need of aught that ye have heard before, since they to whom people attribute these words and traditions shine as the sun in the heaven of holy and exalted sanctity, and have explained to the people all wherein they differed and that which was ordained in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThese have ascended unto God and their beauty hath been veiled from the eyes of those who disbelieved and joined partners with God, and who await the luminous lamp that is lit and shineth forth from behind crystal globes, guiding people to the precincts of holiness and grace and bringing them to the vicinity of treasured glory. Withal, none needeth aught save what hath been ordained in the laws of the Spirit from the presence of the renowned Mighty One. However, since thou hast stood at the gate from which no creature hath ever been turned away disappointed, We have therefore cast upon thee a sprinkling from this vast, surging, billowing, and concealed ocean, that the proof from God's presence might be complete unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, that haply the people may arise from their beds of heedlessness before God.\n\nKnow thou that the words of God and His Messengers possess meanings beyond meanings, interpretations beyond interpretations, and symbols, allusions, evidences and wisdom without end. No one shall comprehend even a single letter of their meanings except whom thy Lord willeth, for their meanings are their treasures which they have stored in the treasuries of words. None knoweth their mysteries save God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy. And their interpretation shall be known to everyone who ascendeth to the heavens of nearness and holiness, whose vision hath been sanctified by the remembrance of God, and who hath attained to that station wherein the tongue hidden within his innermost being testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He is the One Who was when naught else existed beside Him. Then shall he comprehend all the meanings and knowledge concealed within all things ere the command \"Be\" and it is. Thus doth the Dove teach thee from the melodies of eternity and instruct thee in that which shall sever thee from all who dwell on earth and in heaven, that thou mayest strive within thyself and ascend from this nether realm to the most exalted heavens, to a sacred seat well-beloved.\n\nKnow that by 'Friday' is meant the Day whereon mankind gathereth before God, and wherein God establisheth His Cause through the Manifestation of His Self - this is a truth well-known. On that Day the Dove of Eternity warbleth its melody, and the Cock of the Throne raiseth its call, and the heavens of justice are upraised. On that Day all creatures shall be gathered together with all they have wrought in their vain life, and shall be requited according to their deeds. This is the Day of Assembly, whose decree hath been sent down in the Qur'an, as ye do read. Therefore it cannot be confined within limits, nor restricted to a particular day. Rather, every Day wherein God manifesteth Himself is called Friday, did ye but know. When Muhammad arose on that Day with the Cause, it was named by this name and became specifically associated with it, as ye do reckon. This is the Day that hath been called the Day of Mutual Loss and Gain, the Day of Return, the Striking Hour, the Sure Hour, the Calamity, and other names, for on that Day all these things appeared, and whatsoever else ye know not. It is called the Day of Resurrection for on it God arose through His Qaim, and appeared through a Word that caused the heavens to be cleft asunder and the earth to quake, and all between them save those who were patient and were assured of God's signs. The Resurrection was fulfilled through God's arising, yet none perceived it save the sincere ones. Hast thou not heard how in the days of God there descended upon the faithful from the heaven of glory the holy feast, whereof they all partook? Every Friday they were encompassed by God's favors from every direction, and they were nourished every day with the holy fruits of reunion - nay, at every moment they were honored by God's grace, and at every instant God's verses were sent down unto them through His ambassadors, He the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Well is it with him who attained unto His days in the Day of Resurrection, and hastened to attain His grace, and was of those who delighted in the fruits of the Spirit. All this came to pass and the Resurrection ended, and We weep with Our inner eyes at its passing, and ye, O lovers, weep ye now also. Alas for the sorrow that the Resurrection hath been rolled up, and Beauty hath been veiled, and the Dove hath returned, and the gates of grace have been closed after they were opened, and the lights of the Face have been concealed, and the heavenly feast hath been withheld because of what the hands of the unbelievers have wrought. Thereby were consumed the hearts of those who dwelt within the pavilions of the names. Fie upon you, O people of the earth, and upon those who follow you in your deeds and actions! For ye turned away from the Beauty of God after He appeared in truth and shone forth upon you from a holy and beloved horizon, and ye perceive not what hath passed you by, and even now ye remain unaware. None shall attain unto it save in the time of the One Whom God Shall Make Manifest, and this is what God hath written by the fingers of power upon preserved tablets of glory. This is among God's ways which have been decreed in truth, and there is no altering it. Blessed is he who shall arise from the couch of his heart on the Day when all shall be gathered together in the holy and exalted presence of God, the All-Powerful. Say: O people of the earth! Arise from your couches and make up for what hath passed you by. Have mercy upon yourselves, then be not veiled from the Beauty of God. By God! Nothing in all creation shall profit you save this, would ye but reflect for less than a moment within yourselves. Say: O people! By God, were ye to consider what your hands have wrought in God's days, ye would find no rest upon your seats.\n\nMake amends for what has passed from you and have mercy upon yourselves and upon the Beauty of God. Be not veiled, for by God, naught shall profit you in the realm save this, could ye but reflect for less than a moment within yourselves. Say: O people! By God, were ye to consider what your hands have wrought in God's Day, ye would find no rest upon your seats, nor would ye dwell in your homes, but would sit upon the ashes and weep as those who weep for their sons--nay, more intensely than this, to a degree that cannot be reckoned or described by the Pen. And this shall become evident unto them at the hour when their spirits depart from their bodies and unto dust do they return. Then know, O my brother, that God hath hidden favors and concealed bounties and hidden worlds that none hath discovered save those who soar in the atmosphere of nearness with the twin wings of the spirit. And should anyone from this world encounter one from another world above it, he would be amazed and would exclaim: \"Glory be to God, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting!\" And among His worlds is a world wherein the breezes of grace and bounty ceaselessly blow, not pausing for an instant. Should anyone reach it, he would find all bounty at all times from God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, such that nothing of grace, mercy, providence, bounty and generosity--which hath existed from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end--would be withheld from him, and he would delight in every minute in every blessing. Thus have We completed Our favor unto thee and brought thee to a shore at which the mystics are bewildered. Well is it with him who hath attained thereunto and knoweth the worth of what God hath bestowed upon him through His grace, which none before have surpassed and none after shall comprehend. And praise be to God, from Whom all created things have their beginning and unto Whom all shall return.\n\n=== END BH00031 ===\n\n=== START BH00032 ===\n\nThis is the Tablet of Spirit, which hath been sent down in truth, and God hath made it a living, vital spirit, that thereby the hearts of all the world may be quickened. It abideth through the everlasting duration of Mine Own Self, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, for verily My Self is His Self, did ye but know it. Glorified be He within Whose grasp lieth dominion over the Kingdom of verses. He causeth them to be revealed as He pleaseth, by His command, and He is verily the Sovereign, the Single, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.\n\nSay: O people, these are the verses of God your Creator, sent down unto you from the clouds of destiny, that ye may witness the handiwork of your Maker between earth and heaven, and be established upon the throne of independence beneath the shadow of this Beauty, from which hath shone forth the Sun of Grandeur in the heaven of eternity, then the Sun of Power from the horizon of beginning, then the Sun of Glory in the heaven of fulfillment, then the suns of the former and the latter generations.\n\nO Ancient Pen! Make mention of 'Ali, concerning that which Satan cast into the hearts of those who opposed God on the Day when He was established upon the throne with manifest sovereignty, that he may be mindful within himself and steadfast in the Cause of his Lord, to such extent that should all the factions dispute with him, he would find no disquiet within himself, and would regard all things as on that Day when no mention of them existed before God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAmong the polytheists is he who said: When the Spirit dieth, doth his name endure in the kingdom through what a numbered few of those who believe and are possessed of clear certitude ascribe to him? Say: By God! The Spirit dieth not ever, rather all who enter beneath his shadow shall endure through him, and thus was the matter ordained, were ye of those who know. The life of all things standeth through his existence, and their vitality through his self, were ye of those who perceive. Say: He prideth not himself on aught of what hath been created between the heavens and the earth, for all that was created by His Word, were ye of the fair-minded. And should he take pride in aught, he would take pride in his self, not in what is other than it, and in him do all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth, and what lieth in the dominion of Command and Creation, take pride, were ye of those who know.\n\nSay: O mountain of rancor, pinnacle of hatred, and vessel of envy, die in thy wrath, then burn in the fire which God hath kindled in thy breast! By God! That which no mind hath conceived and no one's knowledge among all the worlds hath encompassed hath appeared. Say: My description is My Self, and that which proceedeth from My mighty, transcendent, glorious and wondrous Pen. As for you, O concourse of polytheists, if ye pride yourselves that your names endure among the beasts or your mention among the cattle, then take pride, for this is your station and the station of those who follow you without clear proof or a glorious Book. Thus have We made you worshippers of names, and among those who cling to them, such that ye take pride in them upon your seats, yet are not among those who perceive. Therefore worship your gods and your desires; God shall soon render you and them as scattered dust, such that no trace of you shall remain upon the earth. This hath been irrevocably decreed in the preserved tablets of glory. Say: By God! All in which ye take pride in these days is cast behind them by servants who attribute themselves to My Self, and how much more to My manifest, resplendent and gracious Beauty! Therefore witness how We have made delusion to rule over you in the earth, by reason of what your hands have wrought, O ye heedless ones!\n\nO 'Ali! Hear what the polytheists say, then ponder what issues from their mouths - how they deny Him through Whom their names were exalted, their station elevated, and their traces spread throughout the worlds. Among the polytheists is he who in his soul rebels against God and says that the people will never follow this Youth Who is established upon the throne of holy and luminous sanctity, and that His Cause will never be established in the earth. Thus do they seek to cure the ailments of their souls and are numbered among those who rejoice. Say: By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Soon will God send forth from the clouds of His Cause hosts with a meteor of power and might who will aid the Youth with such triumph as the eyes of all creation have never witnessed. Through His sovereignty He will raise up the realities of the Prophets and Messengers and cause them to hear the melodies of the leaves suspended upon the branch of this Tree which has grown upon the Sinai of the All-Merciful in this Ridvan which has appeared in the name of the All-Glorious upon this holy, wondrous and inaccessible station. And when the winds blow through them, the sweetest melodies are revealed in praise of this Youth Who is established upon the throne of names and attributes - that there is no God but Him, and that this indeed is the Youth Whom the Manifestations of Glory serve, they whom the All-Merciful has fashioned after His resplendent, holy and luminous beauty. Say: By God! This Youth has fallen into the well of envy and hatred. Would that there were some travelers to let down their bucket, that perchance through it the sun of His beauty might shine forth from the horizon of this well whose depth extends between the heavens and the earth. O 'Ali! Leave the polytheists and what issues from their mouths, then ascend on wings of ruby to the holy and supreme atmosphere that thou mayest witness all created things in the shadow of thy Lord and be of those who are firmly established. And when the lights of the garment shine forth upon thee from this luminous Temple, fall prostrate upon the dust in humility before God, that thy face may be illumined thereby among the worlds. Say: O people! Fear God and be not proud before Him after He has come upon clouds of light, surrounded by dawning suns through but one ray of which the kingdom of creation and command would be illumined, were ye of those who know. O people! If We were to deny the beauty of the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation, by what proof could We establish Our faith in God's Messengers of old and in Ali before Nabil? Thus has the Voice of Sinai spoken in this unfurled scroll that ye may witness the handiwork of your Lord and be of those who are steadfast. O 'Ali! In this journey thou hast witnessed what has befallen Me and hast heard the utterances of the polytheists concerning Me, and wert among those who bore witness, until they rose up against Me and pronounced sentence of death upon Me - after that through My arising between earth and heaven God's Cause was made manifest and His mention exalted throughout the worlds. Through mention of Me were they mentioned, their names were elevated, and their traces became renowned throughout East and West. We were protecting them from the harm of those among the peoples of the earth who sought to slay them, and We made My kindred serve them at every hour and every moment. Yet they busied themselves in the most hidden secrecy with plotting against My Cause and whispering in the hearts of those over whose hearts had wafted the breezes of the All-Merciful from this Ridvan, in the shadow of but one leaf of which were created gardens of mighty glory. Until at last they arose to slay Me, yet I pardoned them despite My power and concealed their deeds despite My sovereignty.\n\nAnd I concealed from them My sovereignty, and I forbore in My clemency, for I am the One Who has power over whatsoever I desire, and I am the Mighty, the Bountiful, the Most High, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Despite all this that I have witnessed, thou shalt soon behold that they attribute all of this and all that they have done unto My sanctified, glorious and luminous Self. All of this and what was done unto Me they attribute unto themselves, to such extent that the oppressor claims for himself the station of being utterly oppressed. Thus dost thou witness their falsehood and recognize My tribulation throughout twenty years. Thus do We recount unto thee from the stories of truth, and thou shalt soon witness their traces in the earth and be of them that reflect.\n\nSay: O people! Fear ye God and let not names deceive you. By God! Verily these names and their kingdom were created by what hath flowed from My Pen upon tablets of mighty glory. Deprive not yourselves of the Sun of grace and beneficence in the days of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and follow not Satan in your souls lest ye be among the losers. Say: O people! Ye have done unto the Self of God what none hath done unto another, until His face was veiled after it had ever been radiant from the horizon of holiness with manifest and brilliant light.\n\nO 'Ali! So grievous hath become the matter unto Me that My sanctity hath been violated amongst the people, that perchance thereby the hands of hatred might be lifted from above My head, though they will not be content with aught save the shedding of My blood upon the earth, that with it may be reddened the tresses of the Maids of Heaven in their sanctified and sublime chambers. Such abasement have I reached that I sat in the house alone, solitary and single, to such extent that when the chief of the city desired to appear before the Youth, he found the door locked, and when We opened the door unto his face, there was none with Us to serve him. Thereat did all things weep, and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God were rent asunder. They who speak as children speak and are powerless to speak before your Lord, the Most Merciful, object to the verses of God and His grandeur, though by a single letter thereof were their realities created, as well as all the words of them that are veiled. Say: Today, were all who are in the heavens and earth to become luminous mirrors and radiant jewels, all of them speaking the praise of their Creator and worshipping their Fashioner, and yet believe not in this Beauty after He hath been established upon the throne of glory, their deeds would be rendered vain in that instant and they would be cast into the depths of the nethermost fire. Say: Today no soul possesseth aught for itself, nor can anyone avail himself of all that is in the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them, except by entering beneath the shadow of this Cause that hath appeared from the Dayspring of eternity, accompanied by the hosts of the unseen which no eyes among all creation can behold, save them that have purified their sight from the veils of the people of tyranny and error and have entered upon seats of glory, a sanctified and resplendent station.\n\nO My Name! By God, wert thou to discover the grief of My heart, thou wouldst not remain in thy place, but from thee would burst forth the fire of sorrows, ascending until it reached the hem of the All-Merciful in the supreme Paradise. For I have offered up My soul and all that My Lord hath bestowed upon Me for these who have risen to slay Me in these days when all peoples have risen against Me. They have imprisoned Me in this dark and distant land. How many nights I have not slept upon My couch to preserve their lives, while they lay upon beds of hatred among those who slumber. How many days have I set My breast against the arrows of enemies lest there should befall them that which would cause them to cry out in anguish. I have striven to preserve their lives while they have endeavored to destroy My hallowed, mighty, and glorious Being. Until these days arrived wherein God hath revealed the treachery of their eyes and what hatred for this Youth they had concealed in their breasts - this Youth Who hath dawned from the horizon of all horizons with great sovereignty and majesty.\n\nSay: O concourse of loved ones! Do ye sleep upon your couches while the Eye of God gazeth toward the scene of tribulation and the Body of God is pierced by the arrows of the hypocrites? Do ye walk in the marketplaces after the Luminary of the horizons hath again been imprisoned through what the hands of the people of discord have wrought, such that His feet find no resting place and He sitteth in His house without helper or supporter? Do ye rejoice, O people, in your own gladness after God's joy hath been cut off, to such degree that His lips part not by reason of the hardships inflicted by these oppressors? Do ye light lamps in your nights after God's lamp hath disappeared from among you through the whisperings of the sinners? O My loved ones! How can ye witness the sun and its radiance after the Sun of Eternity hath been eclipsed by veils of rancor and hatred between earth and heaven? By this hath the Eye of Grandeur wept crimson tears in the Most Exalted Paradise and the pillars of the mighty Throne have quaked. Do ye comb your hair after the hair of the Youth hath been stripped of the raiment of victory and proclaimeth 'This indeed is the Wronged One among these oppressors'? O people! Do ye sleep upon soft beds after the Temple of God hath been disturbed upon the carpet and His body wounded by the spears of the envious? O loved ones of God! Purify your hearts from the world and its mention and all that is therein, then lay your faces in the dust and say:\n\nO Lord! This Joseph of Eternity has fallen under the claws of the wolves of hatred, and his gaze has turned to none save the direction of Thy bounties and favors. Therefore, have mercy upon him through Thy generosity, then protect him through Thy sovereignty, then aid him through the wonders of Thy victory with hosts which none of the heedless can see. O Lord! His affliction has reached such a degree that the servants who were created by His will and exalted by His command have risen against Him. Therefore, O my God, send down upon Thy loved ones that which will preserve them from all else but Thee, then establish for them a firm footing with Thee, then guard them from the hosts of Satan. Then make firm, O my God, our feet upon this path whereon even the feet of them that are nigh unto Thee cannot stand firm - they who behold naught in all things save the effulgent rays of the sun of the glory of Thy sovereignty, who turn unto naught save the glances of the eyes of Thy mercy and Thy favors, and who have attained such detachment that nothing can prevent them from praising Thy Self and mentioning Thy Beauty, the Manifest, the Most Holy, the Wondrous, the Generous. O Lord! Thou seest how the Friend was tried at the hands of Nimrod, and Moses at the hands of Pharaoh, and the Spirit at the hands of the Jews, and Muhammad at the hands of Abu Jahl, and Ali at the hands of the people of the Furqan, and this Husayn at the hands of the people of the Bayan. O Lord! Aid Him then with the hosts of Thy Cause, and raise Him from this pit whose depths none can fathom. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Potent, the All-Powerful.\n\nThus doth the Tongue of Remembrance teach you that ye may arise to praise your Creator and be of them that remember. O 'Ali! Arise to serve God and aid His Cause, then speak forth the mention of His Self amongst the worlds and fear no one. By God, the Truth! The Most Great Spirit will confirm thee in the Cause of thy Lord, and the Holy Spirit will speak through thy tongue in that moment when thy lips are opened to praise this Wronged One Who is oppressed in the hands of these wrongdoers. Say: O people! Know God by God, for all else is known through Him while He cannot be known through any but Himself. Glorified and exalted is He above being known through His creation. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. All before Him are as abject servants. Say: O people of Baha! Grieve not for what hath befallen Us, but be patient in adversity and put your trust in your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful. Then board the crimson ark in My Most Great Name and sail upon the seas of grandeur, and pay no heed to the people of earth and heaven. By God! All have perished in the depths of extinction save those who have clung to this holy and mighty and impregnable Ark. And if We acquaint you with that which would sadden your hearts, Our purpose is only to inform you of what hath befallen Us at the hands of Our servants. Otherwise, by Him in Whose hand is the soul of Baha, a gnat that flieth in the vicinity of any one of My loved ones would be victorious over these people and their like; nay, were God to permit it, it would swallow them all with a single breath. Thus is thy Lord powerful over all things and mighty over the worlds. But We have been patient and have concealed matters, being mindful of the direction of destiny in the realms of its fulfillment, and none among all created things hath been informed thereof, that God's proof might be perfected unto His creatures, and His evidence unto His creation, and His argument unto the people of His kingdom. Verily, He is the Judge over what He willeth. He ordaineth as He pleaseth.\n\nO 'Ali, witness that this Cause is more wondrous than any wonder, such that it hath no likeness in creation nor peer in invention. If thou wouldst turn thy gaze unto the Greatest Perspective of God, thou wouldst know this and be attracted by the fragrances of these days, and the rapture of the Youth would seize thee and raise thee to the paradise of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - that station wherein should anyone enter, he would discover the mysteries of what hath been and what shall be, and would find himself independent of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. And thou wouldst witness that on this Day one's faith shall profit no soul except after recognition of its Lord, even should one bring forth the books of the ancients and the scriptures of the latter generations. Consider, for example, the lamp-niche: though it be fashioned of the finest crystal or most delicate glass, its purpose is but to hold the lamp, and if it be deprived of that which is intended, can it profit anyone? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Rather, thou wouldst find it a useless instrument in creation, neither harming nor benefiting any possessor thereof. Similarly, witness concerning the verses: though they descend like rain from a holy and exalted cloud, if they contain not the mention of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, can they profit thee in aught? Nay, by My bountiful Self, wert thou of them that perceive! Verily, the verses are as a niche for the lamp of the mention of the Lord of Names and Attributes. If deprived thereof, they would be rejected and cast upon the earth like a body without spirit, unmoved by the spring breezes. Thus have We set forth for thee a holy similitude that thou mayest discover the mysteries of the Cause and inhale the fragrance of the All-Merciful from this ocean of musk that hath been sprinkled upon this camphor Tablet in this Revelation, round which circle the Spot of Sinai and the Sinai of Light, and from which hath appeared the scroll spread out in this joyous Tablet. Yet most of the people are in manifest drunkenness. Say: O people! Those whom ye have taken as lords besides God are but names which ye and your fathers have coined, for which God hath sent down no authority, were ye but to know.\n\nO 'Ali, strip thyself of all allusions, then plunge into the surging depths of this Ocean whereunto none among these human-beasts have attained save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath willed, that thou mayest hear from the whales of this ocean the glorification of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, in this Wronged One Who, when He desireth to manifest Himself in the realm of names, chooseth one from among them and calleth His Temple thereby, that the people of creation may know Him between earth and heaven, though verily He is sanctified above being known through aught but Himself. Yet this is of His grace unto His seeking servants.\n\nSay: O trees of the souls, deprive not yourselves of God's springtime. By God the Truth! The spring of the All-Merciful hath appeared from this Ridvan which hath been manifested in human form. We had indeed informed them of this aforetime, yet they were unaware and were among the heedless. And whoso beareth not the fruits of remembrance in this Wise Remembrance, in this mighty and wondrous Spring, it behooveth him to be cut down and cast into the fire, for neither himself nor any among the company of them that draw nigh shall profit from him.\n\nO My Name! Soon shalt thou hear the clamor of the idolaters from every near and distant quarter, even as We forewarned thee in the Tablet which was revealed in Iraq a year before the Luminary of the horizons departed therefrom, if thou be of them that hear. And if thou hast not that Tablet with thee, seek it out and read it in the course of time, that thou mayest become aware of the mysteries of destiny inscribed by the Finger of Divine Decree, which none among all the peoples of the world hath comprehended. Then bear thou witness in this Announcement to all that thou didst witness in the Announcement of Ali when He appeared with a manifest sovereignty - nay, rather, to even greater things, for this is a Cause the like of which hath not appeared on earth, as the Manifestation itself doth testify, if thou be of them that bear witness. Soon shall the people of the Bayan rise against Me even as the people of the Furqan rose against Ali - nay, more severely, if ye be of them that ponder the Cause of God. For these are the days of the most mighty convulsion, when the Most Great Trump is sounded, and the Most Glorious Bugle is blown, wherein all feet do slip and most of the servants are thrown into confusion. Therein is the clarion sounded through this Name whereby the Beauty of the Primal One hath appeared once again, rising from the Dayspring of Beauty with the sovereignty of might and majesty, calling all to God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful. But grieve not thou at this, for God shall soon raise up pure hearts, sanctified souls, and a new creation, and shall cause them to abide beneath the shade of this Paradise, where the fingers of the All-Merciful shall give them to drink of the wine of certitude, such that all who dwell in the heavens and on earth shall appear as though none had ever been mentioned before them. By My Beauty! One soul from among these, in their steadfastness in the Cause, is better in the sight of God than the combined worship of all the worlds. These shall recline upon holy couches in the Most Great Paradise, while the youth of the All-Merciful shall circle round them with chalices of living water, giving them to drink at every moment. Thus was it sent down aforetime from the heaven of grace, and their Lord gave them to drink of a pure beverage. Thus doth the Most Great Ocean surge upon thee, each wave whereof proclaimeth \"I am God, there is none other God but Me, and I have ever been remembered in the hearts of the worlds,\" that thereby thine eyes may be consoled and thy body find repose upon the throne of tranquility, and thou mayest be made joyous through the favors of thy Lord. Then convey thou from Us pure remembrance to Our loved ones whose eyes are fixed in expectation of the wondrous mercies of thy Lord, that the lights of eternity might shine upon them from the direction of the Divine Presence, and that they might be sustained, through the grace of the Beauty, from the heaven of this bounty.\n\nSay: O people! Be patient in what hath been showered upon you from the ocean of destiny. Then remember this Beauty Who hath been cast into the well of darkness by the hands of the wicked. Put your trust in all matters in God Who created you by His command, and verily He shall guard you from every rejected polytheist. Beware lest ye differ among yourselves. Unite in the love of God and His Cause, and be as one soul. By God, this is more beloved before your Lord than any beloved thing. Thereby shall the foundations of the polytheists be shaken, and the back of every detested transgressor be broken. Beware, beware of corruption and discord, for thereby harm returneth unto the hallowed and exalted Lote-Tree. Be God's guides in His earth and His trustees in His lands. By the True One! Soon shall pass away the kingdom and all that is therein and thereon, but there shall remain for you what ye were counseled by the Pen of witnessed glory. Sanctify yourselves from all that causeth discord between you, that God may behold you purified from every defilement and from all that His good-pleasure loveth not. This is what ye were commanded in the forbidden holy Tablets. Thus doth the Pen of the All-Merciful counsel you at a time when sorrows have encompassed it from all directions. God sufficeth as witness unto this.\n\nO 'Ali! Remind these souls of what We have mentioned unto thee in this Tablet, that perchance there may be kindled in their hearts that which shall gather them upon the shore of a blessed Name. And if adversity toucheth thee in My path, be patient and grieve not, for He shall suffice thee in truth and shall raise thee to a station which hath been in truth praiseworthy. And if thou findest thyself alone, sorrow not, but take comfort in My Being, for We shall be with thee at all times, at eventide and at dawn. By God, O My Name! In grief I have reached such a state that My Pen weepeth over Mine own Self by reason of what hath befallen Me at the hands of those who have denied God and were debarred from the sanctuary of justice.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! How excellent is what ye have done unto My Person and what ye were enjoined in all the Tablets from God! By God, O 'Ali! There remained not a single Tablet but that He informed them of My Cause, gave them glad-tidings of My Being, spoke unto them of My signs, and acquainted them with My mention. Yet, despite this, they did unto My Person what no one hath ever done unto anyone, and God sufficeth as witness unto this - after I had manifested My Self with sovereignty of might and power, and beyond that with proof that encompassed all worlds.\n\nSay: O people! By God! After My manifestation all traces have been effaced from everything save for those who have entered this Paradise which was witnessed at the pivot of Paradise. And when they desired to fulfill God's covenant and testament, they issued the verdict for My execution and in their souls rejoiced thereat. By the True One, O 'Ali! Today every atom refuteth them in all their claims, nay, their own selves and beings, and beyond that every truthful and trustworthy tongue. For they claim that they believed in Ali and what was sent down unto him of God's verses, yet when he appeared again with His verses, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His majesty, they denied Him and turned back upon the heels of rejection.\n\nKnow then, O 'Ali, that there hath come before God a letter from one of the people of Qaf who previously wavered in this Cause, wherein he inquireth about My station. We have answered him in this Tablet with words that draw forth the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. If thou findest a messenger, send it unto him, that perchance the lightning-flashes of the favors of his Lord may seize him, sever him from allusions, guide him to the Kawthar of grace, and make him one of the sincere ones who, when the Sun of Verses dawneth upon them from the horizon of the words that have descended upon the Pen from the Ancient Beauty, fall prostrate upon their faces before their Lord, the All-Merciful, and rend asunder the veils of doubt and sorrow in their longing to attain the presence of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and become of them that are well-assured. And if thou findest no messenger, then wait until God bringeth about His purpose. Verily there is no sender save Him. He bestoweth what He willeth upon whom He willeth, and withholdeth from whom He willeth what He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Bountiful.\n\nGlorified be He Who sent down the verses aforetime even as He hath sent them down now in truth, that they might serve as a proof and a remembrance unto all the worlds. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the command, and all shall return unto Him. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not. Within His grasp lieth the dominion of all things. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. His is the creation and the command. He manifesteth in the kingdom what He willeth and withholdeth what He willeth, and giveth to whom He willeth what He willeth. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Thus hath He ever been powerful in His dominion and the kingdom of His decree. The denial of the denier hindereth Him not, nor doth the unbelief of the infidel alter His word, nor doth the associating of the polytheist impede Him. He speaketh at all times, even as was revealed in the Bayan: \"I am God, there is no God but Me, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.\"\n\nOnce He sent Adam with the truth with clear signs and made him a mercy unto the worlds. Then He sent Noah with the truth, then after him Hud, then after him ?ali?, and sent down with them proofs that all creation would be powerless to produce. Until the Cause reached the Friend (Abraham), whereupon He made him manifest from the Dayspring of holiness and sent him with His proof, His evidence, His testimony, and His sign unto them that know. Then after that He sent Moses, after having manifested Himself unto him in the holy vale upon the Sinai of nearness from the Blessed Tree, the Eternal, the Everlasting, the One, saying: \"Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have created thee by My command. Go unto Pharaoh and his nobles that they may become mindful.\" And He gave him nine clear signs, as We have mentioned in the ancient scrolls, among them the rod of command whereby We parted the sea for Moses and drowned therein those who denied the signs of God and were among the proud before their Lord. Then after that He chose the Spirit whom He named in the kingdom of names the Son of Mary, and sent him unto another people, and commanded all these to remind people of the days of God. By God the Truth! These days are of His days, were ye to know. Even as was revealed in the Qur'an unto Moses: \"O Moses! Lead thy people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.\" Thus was it revealed aforetime, were ye to know.\n\nThen after this He chose Muhammad in the Most Exalted Concourse and sent him forth from the dawning-place of Hijaz with manifest sovereignty, and sent down with him a Criterion to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and to remind the people of this Most Great, Most Upright, Ancient News. Then after this He was well-pleased with Ali in truth and chose him from among His creation and selected him, then elected him from amidst His creatures and sent him with sovereignty and a mighty command. Through him were the heavens of knowledge cleft asunder and the seas of holiness set in motion, and every lofty and impregnable mountain was ground to powder. Through him were all atoms and all beings created, and all things were raised from their graves, were ye of them that perceive. And all were adorned with the robes of God's grace which appeared with him. Thus doth this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Luminous Pen reveal unto you the verses. Through him was every matter distinguished, every mystery unveiled, every bounty perfected, every proof completed, and the heavens and earths illumined. We therefore testify that there is no God but Him and that Ali is His Messenger Whom He sent with truth unto all created things. We have believed in him and in what was revealed unto him from God, the Sovereign, the True, the Ancient.\n\nO thou who art designated by \"H\" before \"D\" before \"Y\", strive within thyself lest thou oppose this Name whereby thou wast named in the Concourse of Names, and be not of the heedless. Know thou that a letter from thee hath come before Us, and We have read it and were among the witnesses. However, We were astonished at what thou didst ask, for this beseemeth thee not, wert thou of them that know. Would it be fitting for anyone to ask the sun, \"Where is thy radiance and thy manifestation?\" Say: Open thine eyes, for verily it hath shone upon all the worlds, such that its radiance hath encompassed the east of the earth and its west, as do testify the denizens of the realms of eternity, then the kingdom of names, then all that was and will be, wert thou of the fair-minded. Would anyone ask the ocean, \"Where are thy waves?\" Say: Open thine eyes, then behold that thou mayest be of them that witness. For verily it surgeth at every instant with waves whereof were but a drop to fall upon you, it would drown all who are in the heavens and the earth. Therefore did We withhold the Pen in answering thee for fifty thousand years or more, wert thou of them that know. Then after this We heard God's call from behind the holy veils with a call that bewildered the hearts of the mystics, saying: \"O servant! Take up the Pen and delay not in this, for by this wast thou commanded in the primal eternity. Beware lest thou break God's covenant and violate His testament. Rather, fulfill thy covenant and be of them that are grateful to God Who created thee and sent thee and revealed with thee a proof whereby the dwellers of the heavens and the earth were shaken, save those whom no hindrance could hinder, nor veils of falsehood could conceal, nor the rejection of the opposers could repel.\" Verily those who harbor in their hearts naught but the winds of rancor and hypocrisy declare with their tongues that they have believed in God and His verses, but God testifieth that they are among the liars. Say: If ye have believed in God, then by what proof do ye turn away from Him through Whom every transcendent and impregnable proof hath appeared and through Whom the suns have shone forth?\n\nYet God testifies that they are among the liars. Say: If you have believed in God, by what proof do you turn away from Him through Whom every transcendent and impregnable proof has appeared, through Whom the suns have shone forth, the clouds have been raised up, the rains have poured down, the seas have surged, the trees have yielded fruit, and every lofty and exalted land has been made to quake? Say: By God, O concourse of polytheists! He is God's dominion over you, and His mercy unto those who profess His unity. He is His sovereignty over you, His might within you, His kingdom amongst you, and His dominion over all created things. Thus do We send down unto you the verses and expound them in detail, that perchance the breeze of the spirit may waft upon you from this holy and luminous Paradise, and that you may detach yourselves from all that you possess and be quickened by this cup from which flow all waters, and likewise Salsabil and Tasnim. Well is it with him who attains unto them, drinks thereof, and is numbered among those who quaff therefrom.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked concerning My station and the station of Him through one letter of Whom the heavens and earth were created, through Whom the waters of eternity rained down from clouds of holy and exalted sanctity - He Whom God hath made the Manifestation of His Beauty among His servants, the Dawning-Place of His names amidst His creation, and hath named Him in the heaven of names as 'Ali before Nabil - by Him the veils of the hidden mysteries in the realm of eternity have been rent asunder, the holy lands have quaked, the pillars of the mighty throne have trembled, all names have been stripped from their namesakes, and all attributes scattered from their ranks, if ye be of them that comprehend. Had We known that thou wouldst hearken unto what the Most Exalted Pen commandeth thee in this luminous, snow-white Tablet, We would have bidden thee to strip thy body, leave thy home, and dwell in the wilderness and mountains as recompense for what thou hast asked and for being among the questioners, or to cast thyself down from towering peaks, if thou be of them that act. But since God hath witnessed in thee weakness, He hath pardoned thee through His grace that encompasseth all worlds.\n\nWhen this mighty, impregnable, wondrous Tablet reacheth thee and thou findest from it the fragrance of God, thy Lord, and thine eyes are solaced by what is therein, and thou hast read what the Tongue of God, the Holy, the Mighty, the Beautiful King, hath sung, arise from thy place, then place this Tablet upon thy head, then turn thy face toward the House, and be of them that seek forgiveness. Ask forgiveness of thy Lord nine times, then turn unto Him and be of them that return. Say: O my Lord! Forgive me through the sovereignty of Thy mercy and Thy loving-kindness, then establish for me a sincere footing with Thy loved ones, then make me one of Thy sincere servants, then cause me, O my God, to be turned toward Thee and toward what appeareth from Thee, then detach me from all else besides Thee, for Thou art the Mighty, the Generous. O my Lord! Pass over what I have wrought and what my hands have acquired, for I have committed a sin whose weight the weight of the heavens and earth cannot sustain, for I desired to know Thy Self after Thou hadst sanctified Thy Self beyond the knowledge of all things and the knowledge of them that are nigh unto Thee.\n\nThen bear witness that there is no God but Him, and that the Primal Point is His Self and His Splendor amongst the worlds, and that no mention of any created thing shall ever be joined with His mention - this is a revelation from God, the Exalted, the Great. Then recite nine times: \"God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and that 'Ali before Nabil is His sovereignty and His splendor between the heavens and the earths.\" Then say nine times: \"God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and that the Revealer of the Bayan is His Self and His Splendor, and all were created by His command and all are preserved by Him in a guarding tablet.\" Then say nine times: \"God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and that He Who appeared in the year sixty is His Cause and His Splendor, then His might and His grandeur amongst all created things.\" Then say nine times: \"God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and that the Most Exalted One is His Splendor and His Essence, Whom God hath sanctified from the mention of aught else but Him and sent with truth and made a proof unto all the worlds.\" Then say nine times: \"God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and that the Primal Point is the Most Great Remembrance amongst the servants - through Him the sun shone forth, the heaven was raised up, the earth was established, the seas were created, the ships sailed, the signs were expounded, the winds were subdued, and this lofty and exalted Tree bore fruit.\" Thus doth the Pen of Command teach thee, lest thou shouldst question anyone concerning thy Lord's Cause, for all besides Him are poor and can neither nourish nor enrich, if ye be of them that perceive. Have you not heard His proof - His verses, and His existence - His evidences? By these every soul can dispense with all else, as every pure and sound heart doth testify. Say: After His manifestation, nothing that hath been created between the heavens and the earth shall profit anyone. Beware lest thou divide the all-embracing Word or alter it from its proper place, and be thou steadfast in justice. Open thine eyes, then look upon thy Lord's signs, then ponder on them and what is treasured in their mystery, that thou mayest discover what was concealed from thee and be of them that rejoice. O servant! Forget thyself, then find solace in the splendor of thy Lord, and be not of the heedless. Know thou that I am a servant who hath believed in God and the Manifestations of His Self and the Daysprings of His Cause and the Treasuries of His Revelation and the Repositories of His Knowledge and the Dawning-places of His Guidance and the Outpourings of His mercy and the Clouds of His bounty unto the worlds. To this my tongue beareth witness, as do those in whose hearts there is no rancor toward this Youth, through Whom the horizons were illumined and leg was wound about leg, and the feet of every iniquitous doubter did slip. Say: O people! By God, I glory in my servitude to His Truth - have mercy, O people, upon myself and yourselves, and be not of the calumniators. O people! Do not as did 'Ad and Thamud, who opposed God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful. Fear God and do not as did the companions of Rass and after them the companions of the sand-hills and the trench, as ye have heard in the tales of the ancients. O people! Dispute not about the signs of God when they are sent down in truth, and be not of them that turn away. O people! Follow not your desires - follow ye God's ways within yourselves and be not of the heedless.\n\nBe not of the heedless ones. O people! Deny not the grace of God amongst you, nor His mercy within you, nor His proof amidst all worlds. O people! Fix your gaze upon God, your Lord, that He may adorn your faces with the radiance of His bounty. Say: By God! In these days when the Sun of Beauty has risen from the horizon of grandeur, questions shall profit you not, save that you turn unto God with manifest humility. Say: O people! Fear God, and fabricate not against His servant, and be not of the oppressors. Beware lest you draw against me the swords of rancor and hatred; have mercy, rather, upon my solitude amidst these idolaters, and upon my tribulation at the hands of mine enemies, whereby I have become imprisoned in this deep pit. Say: O people of the Bayan! Sufficient unto me are the nations of the earth and what ye have wrought against my person, O company of deniers! Say: If these words be my transgression, then by God, the Spirit hath committed it, if ye be of the fair-minded. Have I made lawful what God hath forbidden you, or forbidden what He hath made lawful unto you? Judge fairly, and be not of them that deny. Say: We acknowledge our transgression before you, and God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, doth testify unto this. Say: It is that which floweth from My pen, whereby the breasts of the hypocrites have been filled with rancor against this Youth, after He had been the Lamp of God amongst His servants, by which the kingdom of the heavens and earth was illumined, through which the standards of glory and the banners of triumph were raised, and bounty reached such heights that none but the most wretched denier would reject it. And thou, remind the people of that which the Youth hath testified concerning Himself, that they might find relief from the harm of the idolaters. Therefore witness what Mine eyes now witness, that there is no God but He, and that 'Ali-before-Nabil is His servant and His glory, all were created by His command and all are among them that act by His command. Yet by God, the Truth, Mine eyes weep and say: Be ashamed of what hath appeared in the kingdom, then hasten unto God's mercy and His sovereignty, O company of believers! Then My lips cry out and say that there is no God but He, and that 'Ali-before-Nabil hath appeared in truth and hath come upon clouds of holiness, surrounded by the near angels. Thus doth He testify as God hath testified unto His own Self, if ye be of them that hear. And My tongue now calleth out and speaketh and testifieth as God hath testified unto His own Essence before the creation of the heavens and earth, that there is no God but He, and that 'Ali is His sovereignty in His kingdom, His grandeur amongst His servants, and His proof amidst His creatures. He hath sent Him with truth by a command whereby the heavens were cleft asunder, the earth was rent, all branches were destroyed, and every surging sea was dried up. Then do My hands testify, both in secret and in public, that there is no God but He, and that 'Ali is the Manifestation of His names, the Revealer of His attributes, the Source of His verses, and through Him the dead were resurrected, as We have witnessed and were among them that bear witness. And My feet do now testify with a voice that every hearing ear can hear, that there is no God but He, and that the Primal Point is His divinity in the kingdom, His might in the lands, His dominion amongst the servants, and through Him appeared all that God hath willed; were it not for Him, nothing would have appeared nor would any grass have grown.\n\nNo creature would move, nor would any grass grow or fruit appear, if ye be of them that understand. Verily my heart yearns and declareth that there is no God but Him, and that the Primal Point is His First and His Last, His Outer and His Inner, and all were created by His command, and all unto Him shall return. Verily my heart laments and beareth witness, even as God did witness before Adam appeared from water and clay, that there is no God but Him, and that Ali is His Manifestation and His Concealment, His Source and His Mine and His Dwelling Place - thus doth it bear witness if ye be of them that testify. But now, O Concourse of Light, bear witness to that which every hair upon my head testifieth with melodies that attract the hearts of them that are nigh, then the hearts of them that glorify, then the hearts of them that are sanctified, then the denizens of the highest paradise, then the dwellers of the realm of eternity, then those at the distance of two bow-lengths or closer, then they that dwell near the Divine Lote Tree. O people! Hearken unto the Call of God from the Ultimate Tree at this Most Luminous, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Spot, that there is no God but Him, and that He Who was sent with the name of Ali is the Sovereign of all contingent beings, the King of all created things, the Word of God amongst His creation, the Book of God amongst His servants, and the Power of God amongst His creatures. Verily He is the True Judge Who judgeth by His command as He pleaseth and doeth what He willeth by His leave. His is the Kingdom of Command and Creation. He quickeneth whom He willeth and causeth to die whom He willeth, He giveth unto whom He willeth and withholdeth from whom He willeth. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thus doth this servant acknowledge his servitude and establisheth it through verses which all created things are powerless to comprehend. And by this proof whereby God's Lordship amongst His creation and His Divinity amongst His creatures hath been established, I establish my faith amidst these prodigals. Soon shall ye hear that they are not content therewith and deny the verses of God after they were sent down in truth from the dominion of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Have ye not heard what was revealed aforetime - none dispute the verses of God save the unbelieving people. And if thou findest in thyself another hearing, then hearken unto what the Herald proclaimeth in the most exalted realm above my head with a wondrous and sublime call. Say: By God! The Spirit speaketh and calleth out that this is indeed the Desired One, if ye be of them that seek, and He is the Beauty of the Worshipped One, if ye be of them that worship. O people of the earth! This is God's trust among you - beware lest ye be of the treacherous. This is God's deposit within you - beware lest ye oppose it, O company of the opposers. Verily He is the Self of God amongst His servants, His Manifestation in His lands, and His Treasure for all who are in the heavens and the earth. He is God's Book among you, His mercy upon you, His bounty unto you, and His might over them that profess His unity. He is God's sanctuary on earth, around which circle the angels that are nigh. O people of the earth! By God, He is the Word of God amongst men, His light in the kingdom of Command and Creation, and His sovereignty over all the worlds. Within Him are concealed treasures of mysteries whereof if but a single letter were revealed, the heavens would be rent asunder, the earth would be cleft, the mountains would crumble, the leaves would fall, and the hearts of the mystics would be sorely shaken.\n\nO people! He is verily the First made manifest in the temple of the Last. Glorified be He Who created Him and sent Him with a clear sovereignty. O people! Do not deprive yourselves of His presence, and be not of the heedless. O people! Seize these days - by God, the eyes of the holy ones have never seen their like. O people! If you deny Him, by what proof can you establish your faith in any of God's Messengers? Produce it then, and be not of those who wait. O people! By God, whoever turns away from Him has turned away from God, and whoever turns to Him has turned to God, the Mighty, the Exalted. O people! Drink from the Kawthar that flows from His mouth and from the Salsabil that streams from this holy, luminous Pen. O people! Do not treat Him as Iblis treated God his Lord, and Nimrod treated Abraham, and Pharaoh treated Moses, and the Jews treated Jesus, and Abu-Jahl treated Muhammad, and Sufyani treated Ali before Nabil. O people! He has sacrificed His spirit for God's Cause to such extent that He has not protected Himself for a moment, and everything bears witness to this, if you be of those who testify. O people! He has endured what no one before Him has endured, and has suffered among the polytheists for twenty years. O people! The marks of iron remain upon His leg and of chains upon His neck, whereat all the denizens of the highest Paradise weep. O people! Tears flow from the eyes of the pure ones in the chambers of holy splendor. O people! You were hiding your faces behind women's veils out of fear for yourselves all these years - can one who stands against enemies be compared to one who flees at the braying of donkeys? Judge fairly within yourselves, if you be of the fair-minded. O people! He is the Divine Lote-Tree among you - from it has appeared a light that were a single gleam thereof to face the inhabitants of the heavens and earth, all would be illumined by its radiance. Exalted be this shining, holy, mighty, wondrous Light! Beware lest you extinguish this Fire and put out God's lamp among you, though you and your like and those before and after you would be powerless to do so. By God! Nothing will be accepted from anyone today except after love for Him, and God is sufficient witness and informed of this. Even if one were to worship God from the beginning that has no beginning to the end which the counters are unable to reckon, yet have not love for this Youth in his heart, it would never be accepted. Rather, the angels would strike his deeds upon his head until returning him to the abode of the polytheists in the lowest depths of hell. O people! Do you deny Him Who calls you to Paradise and remembers you at all times with the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great? He desires no recompense from you, nor does He wish for anything, by God's might and power, if you be of those who know. O people! By God, a glance towards Him is better than whatsoever is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is ordained in the kingdom of Command and Creation, and this is known to every possessor of enlightened vision. O people! Do you deny Him Whom you knew before? Woe unto you, O company of mischief-makers!\n\nO My Name! Thus doth the Spirit cry out above My head at all times, and whenever I seek to restrain it and place the hand of restraint upon its mouth, it will not be silenced. We have found it possessed of mighty power, such that nothing in the heavens or earth can prevent it from that which it desireth. All things lie within its grasp of power like a handful of light dust, and the heavens and earth are as a coin in the palm of its servants, which it moveth as it willeth by the command of its Lord, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Single, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. At such times the Pen groaneth between My fingers with such groaning as causeth the tears of the mystics to flow down radiant cheeks. Whenever it desireth to take hold of the reins and move as it pleaseth, the fingers of power restrain it lest the cry of the deniers be raised. Then doth it weep and say:\n\nO Lord! Loose the reins that I may cast upon all created things a letter from the mysteries that are veiled, concealed, hidden and treasured, that perchance the people of the divine cloud may come to know that which none among all the worlds hath known. O Lord! Withhold me not from the wonders of Thy remembrance, then grant me leave to make mention of that which hath been treasured within my soul of the pearls of wondrous knowledge. O Lord! The idolaters have not known Thee, even though Thy sovereignty hath encompassed the heavens and the earth. O Lord! Hold not back my reins, for I desire to rend asunder the veil of concealment from the face of all created things, that they may become aware in Thy Cause of less than can be numbered, for they are blind in secret and deaf in public, and Thou art, of a truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Lord! Prevent me not from giving all created things to drink from the sweet Kawthar which Thou didst cause to flow within my secret being before the creation of all things, and for which Thou hast ordained no end, that these heedless ones may arise to that which hath escaped them of the wonders of Thy glorious and exalted remembrance. O Lord! Deprive me not of Thy help, for by Thy glory, when I found none on earth to champion Thy Cause, I desired to aid Thee through the power which Thou didst deposit within my soul and of which none is aware save Thy knowing and informed Self. By Thy glory! I shall cause all existence to pause by a movement of my mouth, and this shall not be except by Thy leave, for Thou art the Ruler, the Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent. O Lord! I weep, and every eye weepeth for Thy loneliness and for what Thou hast suffered at the hands of those who neither recognize nor perceive what lieth in Thy court, how much less Thy glorious and luminous Beauty. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! I am bewildered by Thy patience despite Thy power, and by Thy forbearance despite Thy all-encompassing knowledge. Thou art He Who, O my Beloved, hath ordained the water of life in my mouth such that were a single drop thereof to be bestowed upon all created things, they would all arise to Thy triumphant and wondrous Cause.\n\nO Lord! Withhold not created things from this sweet, inaccessible, sublime and glorious water, and distance them not from the gems of the outpouring of Thy grace. Then have mercy upon them through Thy favors and leave them not to their own selves. Verily, Thou art the Doer, the Willing One. Thou doest what Thou pleasest by Thy sovereignty and decreest through Thy power what Thou willest. Nothing can prevent Thee from exercising Thy sovereignty and dominion, and nothing can render Thee powerless over whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. O Lord! Have mercy upon Thy loved ones, for they drink in secret from the blood of their hearts and the pieces of their inner beings, and they are unable to breathe a word about Thy Cause amidst these fettered ones. O Lord! If Thou wilt not vanquish Thine enemies, then have mercy upon Thy chosen ones. Grant them leave to appear in these darkest of nights, for Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Lord! The matter hath become severe for Thy loved ones, such that they have fallen among the wretched and are unable to make mention of the wonders of Thy beauteous remembrance. O Lord! Bring forth from behind the veils one who will remember Thee between the heavens and the earth in such wise that none shall be able to prevent him from that which was created in the highest Kingdom, how much less from that which moveth upon the earth among these idolaters. O Lord! Thy chosen ones are oppressed among the wretched, and there befalleth them at every moment that which changeth the joy of those near unto Thee.\n\nO Pen! Hold thy reins, then be patient and forbearing, and be not of those who rush headlong. By God, the True One! Were but a single letter to be revealed of what We have revealed unto thee, all who are in the heavens and on earth would be thunderstruck, and these few followers would be scattered from around Me. O Ancient Pen! Blot out that which hath dripped from the clouds of Thy knowledge, then swallow up what hath appeared of the pearls of Thy mysteries, for the people cannot distinguish the sun from the shadow, nor clay from a precious pearl. Grieve not over anything, but put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and be of them that place their trust in Him. Let thy Lord suffice thee, and turn not unto anything else; then detach thyself from the deniers. Purify thy sight from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God; turn away from them and turn unto God, thy Lord, for He shall suffice thee against the idolaters. O Pen! Rend not the veil of all created things, nor tear the garment of those who have assumed leadership for themselves as lords besides God and who would sacrifice a thousand prophets lest an atom be diminished from their glory amongst the people. Thus do We reveal unto thee that thou mayest be at peace within thyself and be of the patient ones.\n\nO Pen! Leave these people, then weep over My loneliness and My exile in these days wherein the enemies of God's Self have gathered against Me, devising at every moment a great stratagem, striking at My Person with the sword, then weeping with their eyes and seeking help from the people that they might cast doubt upon all the worlds. By God! The eye of creation hath not seen the like of these who would slay the Ancient King, then stain their garments with false blood and send it to those whom they have taken as lords besides God, that thereby the clamor of the deceivers might be raised. By My beauty! The denizens of the highest Paradise are bewildered by their schemes and by what they plot at eventide and at dawn, and at every moment they sever the arm of God, then wrap a cloth around their own arm and cry out that injury hath befallen them from these people. Thus did they plot aforetime and now as ye, O concourse of the near ones, have witnessed and shall be among the witnesses.\n\nO Nabil-i-'Ali! The verses of thy Lord have now been completed in this Tablet, which God hath made as the garment of His beauty among the worlds, that through it the people of certitude might discover the sweet savors of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and become aware of what hath befallen the Joseph of the Bayan at the hands of Satan's hosts, and be among those who know. If thou desirest, send it to all regions that thereby the eyes of Our chosen servants might be consoled - they whom the gestures of the wicked cannot cause to slip in these dark and terrible days. Thus have We commanded thee in truth, and My command resteth with none but God, and upon Him is My trust, then My seeking of protection, My turning, and My reliance, and He is the Protector of the sincere ones. Beware, O Nabil, and protect the servants of God from all that which their Lord doth not approve, then prevent them from corruption such that if anyone should stretch forth the hands of tyranny against them, they would not oppose him even if he were the most wicked of men, and they would be of the patient ones. Say: O people! Place your trust at every moment in God, your Lord, for He shall seize those who have wronged, and He is the most severe in vengeance. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00032 ===\n\n=== START BH00033 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Great, Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise be to God, Who is unique in utterance and peerless in expression, before Whose Word the oceans of inner meanings bow down when spoken by the tongue of His Will, and all the books of the world prostrate themselves at the revelation of but a single letter of His verses. Through a movement of His finger, the Supreme Pen moves in the Kingdom of Creation and decrees the fate of the last and the first. Every eloquent one has confessed inability before His utterance, and every articulate one has acknowledged inadequacy before His exalted Word, by which He has distinguished between all peoples. Verily it is the drawn sword of God, His established Balance, His extended Path, and His luminous Lamp. Indeed, it is the Most Great Trump and the Most Glorious Bugle. Exalted is He by Whose Name all books, scriptures and psalms are adorned. He is the One Who was called by all His Most Beautiful Names in the ancient scriptures, He Who was named Jehovah in the Torah, the Comforter and Spirit of Truth in the Gospel, and the Great Announcement in the Qur'an, and was given other names in books which none knoweth save God, the Lord of the Throne and the earth. He it is Who sent down the Bayan for His mention and gave glad tidings to the servants of His appearance and coming. Blessed is the ear that hath heard what the Primal Point uttered in the Qayyumu'l-Asma regarding this Most Manifest Revelation and Hidden Mystery, saying: \"O Most Great Master! I am nothing unless Thy power hath raised me up to the Cause. I rely on none but Thee and seek refuge in naught save Thee. Verily, Thou art sufficient in truth.\" Is there one with the sense of smell to perceive the fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance in creation? Is there one with sight to behold the proof and evidence? Is there one with hearing to hear the call of the Lord of Religions Who hath come with power and sovereignty? By God's life! All that is thereon shall perish, and this is the face of our Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O God, by Whose Name the sun of Thy Will hath shone forth from the horizon of heaven and the ark of Thy Purpose hath sailed upon the ocean of grandeur! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou hast subdued all things and made it the Sovereign of all names, to aid Thy loved ones in that which Thou lovest and approvest, and to ordain for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall protect them from those who have turned away from Thy most great signs. O Lord! They are servants who have turned to Thee, cast aside all else but Thee, and taken hold of that which they were commanded in Thy days. O Lord! Make known to them what Thou hast ordained for them through Thy bounty and favor, then inspire them with what Thou hast treasured for them in Thy Kingdom. Thou art He, O my God, Whom the affairs of creation cannot frustrate, nor can the might of the powerful or the dominion of princes weaken. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Remembrance and Thy Most Sublime Word to bless the Afnan of the Tree of Thy Cause, whom Thou hast related to Thyself and made as ensigns among Thy creation and hast mentioned in most of Thy Tablets. They are those whom Thou hast named the Afnan by the tongue of Thy grandeur and distinguished by this name among Thy creation and creatures. O Lord! Send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy that which befitteth Thy greatness and power. Then assist them, O my God, through Thy grace and bounty, and send down upon them a blessing from Thy presence. Thou art He, O my God, Who hath called them to Thyself by Thy Own Self and ordained for them that which my tongue and the tongues of Thy servants are powerless to mention. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom nothing can frustrate and the Sovereign Whom nothing can prevent. Thou hast been from everlasting God, and there was nothing with Thee, and Thou shalt be even as Thou wert before. Verily, Thou art the Witness, the Seer, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\n\"O My Afnan! O thou who hast attained unto the Kawthar of My bounty and gazed upon My horizon! Verily the Cause is mighty, mighty, and the creation weak, weak. We have manifested the Cause, but the people turn away from it. We have sent down the verses, but they hear not. The appointed time has come and the Manifestation of clear signs has appeared, yet the people understand not. That which was promised in God's Books has been revealed, yet the people are heedless thereof. We have explained what was hidden in God's knowledge and revealed what was treasured in God's storehouse, yet most of the people perceive not. The proof has been completed, the heavenly table has been sent down, and the evidence has come, yet the people recognize it not. They have cast aside what is with God and taken what is with their leaders who have turned away from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. They are learned ones in their own sight, but ignorant ones before the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. They have clung to that which perishes, turning away from that which endures. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they know not. They are occupied with fleeting days, heedless of what is with God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Had they known, they would have lamented for themselves, but today they are veiled. By God's life! This is the Day of Rising, yet they sit still; the Day of Utterance, yet they remain silent. Say: O company of mystics! The ocean of life has surged, yet you turn away from it. This is the Day of Awakening, yet you slumber. Have you found the breezes of revelation and turned away? Have you seen the signs and denied them? What ails you that you perceive not? The dwellers of the highest Paradise have been attracted by the wine of the Merciful's utterance, while you sport with your vain imaginations and understand not. Say: O people! Reflect upon the former generations. Where are the tyrants and the pharaohs? Where are their ranks and their thousands? Where are the clashing of their swords and the ladies of their palaces? Where are the roaring of their heroes and the sighing of their desires and deeds? Where are their strongholds and their gatherings? Their unity and their assemblies have been scattered, and their might and glory have been dispersed. Say: Fear God, O people, and follow not every rejected transgressor. Say: Beware lest the affairs of creation prevent you from the Truth. What you see today shall perish, but what has been ordained by God, the Mighty, the Loving, shall endure. Blessed art thou, O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, turnest to My face, and holdest fast to the cord of My grace, while My servants and My creatures who were created by My all-compelling Word that rules over what was and what shall be, have turned away from Me.\" Thus ends \\[the Tablet\\]. The servant thanks God for what He has taught us and bestowed upon us, and for what He has sent down for your honor that causes hearts to rejoice and eyes to be consoled.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the Most Exalted Leaf, His blessed consort, upon her be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, that you had consulted with the distinguished teacher, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - this matter is beloved and acceptable before the Throne. Whatever is deemed expedient and in accordance with wisdom, act upon it. If His Honor accompanies them, it would certainly be most fitting. Some time ago, this servant heard these words from the Ancient Tongue. All matters are manifest and evident before the Throne. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThis servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to prepare the world for the manifestation of that which is now concealed. Most people are observed to be heedless and unaware even of their own best interests. If counsel is given and words of advice offered, it will yield no fruit. They wander in the wilderness of vain imaginings, occupied with their own desires, oblivious even to their apparent interests.\n\nOne incident comes to mind which I submit to your honor to demonstrate people's level of understanding. In the days when the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His grandeur, was in the great city, one day Kamil Pasha, who was one of the ministers of the Sublime State, was present before Him. Among his submissions, he mentioned that he had learned several languages, and enumerated them one by one, exceeding ten or twelve. The Ancient Beauty asked, \"What is the fruit of these multiple languages? It is most regrettable that precious life should be spent on such matters.\" Whatever pearls of utterance emerged from the treasury of the All-Merciful's knowledge, he accepted and acknowledged with utmost joy and delight, yet he was observed to be deprived of acting upon them.\n\nIf people would truly act upon what has flowed from the Supreme Pen, all would attain perfect ease and comfort in all worlds. Regarding the matter of language, that which suffices for all has been revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful's will in the Most Holy Book, and a most mighty and holy Tablet has been revealed in Persian on this subject. If they would act upon it, it would suffice for all, and there would be no need for learning various languages. They waste their lives and lose their time, occupied with what their desires command them. How much hardship they bear for the sake of their own pride, as they now take pride in learning various languages.\n\nIn this regard, that which has been revealed from the Supreme Pen is this, exalted be His grandeur: \"We have decreed in the Most Holy Book: O members of parliaments throughout the world! Choose ye a single language for the use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script. God, verily, maketh plain for you that which shall profit you and enable you to be independent of others. He, of a truth, is the Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nThis binding command has been revealed from the Ancient Realm for the people of the world in general and the members of parliaments in particular, for the execution of commands, laws and ordinances revealed in the Book has been entrusted to the men of the Houses of Justice of God. This decree is the greatest means for unity and the supreme cause for association and fellowship among the peoples of the lands. It is observed that most nations, due to the multiplicity of languages \\[...\\]\n\nIt is observed that due to the diversity of languages among the peoples of the earth, most nations are deprived of association, fellowship, and the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom from one another. Therefore, through pure bounty and grace, all are commanded to choose a language - whether newly created or selected from existing tongues of the earth - and all shall speak it. In this way, the whole earth shall be seen as one city, for all will understand each other's speech and comprehend one another's intent. This is the cause of the world's advancement and elevation. Should a person journey from his homeland and enter any city, it would be as though he had entered his own dwelling. Hold fast to this, O people of the assemblies in cities and lands!\n\nIf one reflects even briefly, he will perceive that whatsoever hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will hath been pure bounty, and its benefit returneth unto all. Yet some souls drink from the breast of heedlessness to such extent that they turn away from that which is manifestly beneficial and superior, both rationally and traditionally, closing their eyes to the Divine wisdom which is the cause and means of the world's progress and the elevation of its peoples. These, verily, are in manifest loss.\n\nEach group speaketh its own tongue - the Turk in Turkish, the Persian in Persian, the Arab in Arabic, and the Europeans in their various languages. These different languages are current among these parties and specific to the aforementioned peoples. Another language hath been ordained that all people of the world shall generally speak it, so that all may know each other's speech and find their purpose. This is the portal of love, fellowship, affection and unity, and it is the Greatest Interpreter and the Key to the Ancient Treasury.\n\nHow many souls have been observed spending all their time learning various languages! What a pity that man should spend his life, which is the most precious thing in existence, on such matters! Their purpose in undertaking these labors is to learn different languages so as to understand the intent of various peoples and what they possess. Now if they would act upon what hath been commanded, it would suffice them all, and they would be freed from these countless toils.\n\nThe Arabic language is the most expansive of all languages. Should anyone become aware of the breadth and scope of this eloquent tongue, he would choose it. The Persian language is also very sweet. The Tongue of God in this Revelation hath spoken in both Arabic and Persian, though Persian hath not had and doth not have the expansiveness of Arabic. Indeed, most languages of the earth are limited in comparison. This is the superiority that hath been mentioned. However, the intent is that the people of the earth should choose one language and all humanity should speak it. This is what God hath decreed, and this is what would benefit the people, were they to know. Likewise, besides the specific scripts of different peoples, one script should be chosen and all people should generally engage in writing it. Eventually all scripts would become one script \\[...\\]\n\nLet all people engage in writing it, and ultimately all scripts shall become one script and all tongues shall converge into one tongue. These two shall become the means of unity for the hearts and souls of the peoples of the world, and the diverse territories of the earth shall be seen as one territory. By the life of God! If the peoples of the earth were to attain to that which hath been revealed in the Book, and the Sun of Justice were to shine forth from behind the clouds, all the world would be seen as one soul. Then would there be seen neither crookedness nor curvature in the earth. O peoples of the earth! He teacheth you that which is best for you. Hold fast unto it, for He is verily the Counselor, the Sincere, the Manifest, the Governor, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Consider now: if the peoples of the earth were to act upon that which floweth from the tongue of grandeur, all would find themselves wealthy, content and free. That which would bring ease to the peoples of the earth - from it they remain heedless, and that which causeth pollution, hardship and affliction of souls - to it they cling. However, that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen shall assuredly come to pass. Ere long, people of insight and understanding shall observe that there is no escape save through acting upon that which hath been revealed in the Divine Book. Consider how in past years, through the selfish desires of but a few souls, what measure of tribulations and ordeals were visited upon the peoples of the earth. Each day the intensity and affliction increaseth, until at last they will hold fast unto that which hath been revealed from the tongue of grandeur concerning the degrees of peace, and act accordingly. His word, exalted be His glory: He is the Sincere Counselor, the Trustworthy.\n\nRegard the world as a human body which, though created whole and perfect, has been afflicted with divers ailments by reason of various causes. Its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell into the hands of unskilled physicians who, having given full rein to their personal desires, have erred grievously. And if at times, through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. And now it is in the hands of those who are intoxicated with the wine of pride. If some of these endeavor to heal it, their purpose is but to profit thereby, whether by name or rank. Such men are not capable of fully removing these grievous afflictions, save to a prescribed degree. And that most great remedy, which constitutes the sovereign cure for the healing of all the world, is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith - a union which can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, perfect and inspired Physician. Whenever that Luminary shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, and that consummate Physician appeared from the dawning-place of celestial wisdom, the diverse physicians became as clouds, veiling His splendors and revelations. Thus did the people of the earth persist in their conflicts, and the world's malady remained unhealed. Those physicians who were powerless to effect this mighty cure not only prevented this divine Physician from treating the illness, but became as intervening veils. Behold in these days how the Ancient Beauty, the Most Great Name, hath unveiled the veils and sacrificed Himself for the life of the world and the unity and salvation of all its peoples. Yet all have risen against Him till at last He was imprisoned in the most desolate of cities, and they have shut all doors of ingress and egress. They have mistaken the friend for a stranger, counted the loved one as a foe, supposed the reformer to be a mischief-maker. O ye possessed of riches and power! Now that ye have become as clouds and prevented the world and its peoples from the effulgent rays of the Sun of Justice and from countless bounties, and have regarded supreme rest as hardship and the greatest blessing as a calamity, hearken at least unto the counsels of that Loving One regarding those matters which ensure the order of the realm and the tranquility of its peoples. Each year ye add to your expenditures and place this burden upon your subjects - this is utterly remote from justice and equity. This is naught but the effect of the tempestuous winds of self and desire that blow and surge between. These cannot be stilled save through a binding peace, which is the greatest means for strengthening the foundations of the edifice of nation and state. There is now no remedy but to merge water with oil. Since complete peace and unity cannot be achieved, this peace must be used as a remedy so that the world's malady may be somewhat alleviated. The peace of kings is conducive to the tranquility of their subjects and peoples. In such case they would need no armaments or provisions save to the extent necessary for protecting their territories.\n\nThey require armaments only to the extent necessary to protect their countries and domains. After this is assured, a small expenditure would suffice, the subjects would be at ease, and the rulers themselves would be free from care. Should any king rise against another following the establishment of peace, all other kings must, united, prevent him. It is strange that they have not yet engaged in this momentous matter. Although some are hindered from accepting this peace, which is conducive to the tranquility of all, by their apparent might of sovereignty and multitude of armies, this is mere illusion and ever shall be. For the honor and glory of man lie in that which befits his station, not in outward means. The discerning observe the ruler to be ruled, count the wealthy as poor, and consider the mighty as weak. Consider the rulers: their governance, wealth, and power depend upon their subjects. Therefore in the eyes of the discerning, these things add nothing to the station of man. The essence of humanity lies hidden within man and must be revealed through the polish of education - this is the station of man. Whatever depends on others has no connection to human reality. Therefore they must not look to paucity or abundance, nor to outward might and grandeur, but must engage in establishing the Most Great Peace. The kings are the manifestations of divine power. It is most regrettable that such noble souls should bear such burdensome affairs. If they would truly entrust the reins of affairs to trustworthy, assured, and wise souls, they would find themselves free and at rest. Blessed is the king who arises to aid God's Cause, to manifest His command, and to illuminate the world with the light of justice. It is incumbent upon all on earth to love him and make mention of his good name. This is what has flowed from the Pen of the Lord of Eternity. We beseech God to assist the peoples in that which profits them and to make known to them what benefits them in this world and the next. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Thus has the Sun of Utterance shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Turn ye unto it and follow not every remote ignorant one.\n\nThis Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Ancient King upon first arrival at the Most Great Prison. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, that through His complete power He may grant hearing ears unto mankind, that all may attain unto the grace of hearkening unto the divine verses. Yet the deeds of men have been and continue to be an impediment. Observe ye what transpired in the land of Sad: although from the beginning of the manifestation of the Ancient Beauty all were forbidden from conflict, corruption and contention - and all are aware of this matter - nevertheless they inflicted upon those two wronged ones (though they had stolen no one's property and no oppression or tyranny was witnessed from them toward any soul, nay rather they were the dawning-places of kindness, mercy and favor) that which pen and tongue are powerless to describe. These abhorrent deeds have been and continue to be the cause of the appearance of the rebellious and tyrannical second 'Ubaydu'llah. How many souls perished and what harm befell both government and people. At this point a word was heard from the blessed tongue, mention of which is not permitted at this time. In any case, we beseech God to aid the heedless souls to return, that what has occurred may suffice. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. In truth, today all are seen to be struck down by the trumpet blast, save whom God willeth. Strange it is that some among the people of the Bayan are more veiled than previous peoples, and some have manifested such deception and guile as hath never been witnessed before - that is, this evanescent servant hath not seen its like in his lifetime. For example, Mirza Ahmad-i-Kirmani, about whom you yourself had written details, manifested such deception as would astonish the mind. His words, exalted be His grandeur, in the Most Holy Book are: \"O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, behold thee in a state which God doth not approve. We perceive from thee that which none knoweth except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We observe what proceedeth from thee in utmost secrecy. With Us is the knowledge of all things recorded in a lucid Tablet.\" These sublime words were revealed from the heaven of divine Will at a time when there was not even outward mention of Ahmad. After several years, successive petitions arrived from him - at times accepting, at others turning away, writhing like a serpent and changing colors like a chameleon. At each moment he appeared in a different hue and in each instant clung to a different branch. I testify that he is in manifest loss. During the days he tarried in the great city, he sent numerous petitions to the Most Holy Court, and likewise many letters to this servant and to His Honor the Name of God 66 (M.H.), upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. All indicated and betokened repentance, contrition, return, lamentation and supplication. An answer was revealed from the heaven of grace, ending with words to this effect: \"Thou art forgiven by divine pardon if thou remainest steadfast in the Cause.\" However his condition was known beforehand, and from the blessed verse of the Most Holy Book his state could be understood, and from the allusive utterance of the Aim of all the worlds it was thus comprehended that some remnant of his remained extant and concealed in that land. Knowledge is with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In the days of departure from Iraq, mention was made of the clamorous ones \\[...\\]\n\nWhen, from Iraq, we were about to depart, mention was made in the divine Tablets of the cawers and the birds of night, and all were warned; likewise, in the Land of Mystery, reference was made in the revealed verses to heedless, atheistic souls. And in certain Tablets were revealed these wondrous and exalted words: \"When there shall come to you a cawer with the Book of Perdition or with leaves of fire, cast them behind you, then know that he is indeed the cawer promised in the Books of God, the All-Glorious, the Most Great.\" That which was hidden is known unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nNumerous verses have been revealed with this meaning. We beseech the Most High to strengthen the hearts of His loved ones and make them manifest in such wise that neither what hath been mentioned in the past nor what shall be mentioned in the future may deter them. Verily, He is the Preserver, the Helper, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nGlory be to God - exalted be His majesty - things have become so evident that no people on earth have any grounds for denial or objection. All divine Books of old are replete with this Most Great Remembrance, and all that hath occurred and shall occur in this Revelation was recorded in previous Books. In one of the Tablets the divine tongue speaketh this word, saying that the divine land is manifest and visible in the land of Syria, and His call is raised from Zion - Zion being a location in these lands. This is why Isaiah saith: \"And I will place salvation in Zion for Israel.\" Consider this verse spoken by Isaiah wherein he saith: \"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\" May my spirit be a sacrifice for the exposition thereof. He giveth tidings of the advent of the Herald, Who is the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - and He hath given word that the Herald would dwell upon the mountains, namely Chihriq and Mah-Ku, as all are aware. And He saith the Herald publisheth peace, from which two meanings can be derived: one referring to the Abode of Peace which was the seat of the Throne, and the other referring to the true peace for all the world which was manifested at the first entry of the Ancient Beauty into the Ridvan. Three verses were uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur at the first entry into the Ridvan, one of which was that the decree of the sword was abolished in this Revelation. This is the true peace which verily all the peoples of the world have attained and shall attain. This is why He saith in other passages that victory must be achieved through wisdom and utterance and whatsoever beseemeth man, both now and in the future. By the life of the Beloved! If they would but hearken unto a single blessed verse with ears sanctified from idle fancy, all would turn to the supreme horizon. Likewise He giveth tidings of the seat of the Throne at the end of the verse in His words \"that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\" And now the standard of God is raised upon Zion and the call of God is lifted up from it and all the holy lands. How sweet is this phrase in this verse where He saith \"that bringeth good tidings of good\" - and this is the good whereof the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - saith, glorified be His mention: \"Then in the year nine ye shall attain unto all good.\" Had this servant found opportunity, he would have mentioned some of the allusions in the divine Books which were revealed aforetime regarding this Most Great Revelation, but time and occasion are in no wise seen, and this matter hath caused this servant embarrassment, inasmuch as there have been and continue to be delays in presenting necessary responses. However, since all are aware that this servant is occupied day and night, no matter how much delay there may be, it hath been and shall be accompanied by kindness, favor and pardon. Glory be to God! This evanescent servant is bewildered - nay, in this station bewilderment is seen to be thunderstruck. Greatest of all strange and wondrous things is the heedlessness \\[...\\]\n\nGlory be to God! This evanescent servant is bewildered, nay, bewilderment itself stands thunderstruck in this station. Greatest of all strange and wondrous things is the heedlessness and rebellion of mankind and the veils of the people of the Bayan, for no sooner have they rent asunder one veil than they have become entangled in a hundred thousand others. Yet the Cause hath been made so manifest as never before since the beginning of creation, and verses have been sent down in such fashion as none have ever witnessed, and evidences have appeared in such wise as to leave no room for hesitation in any fair-minded person. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - hath revealed the essence of the entire Bayan in the guise of a single word. His exalted Word declares: \"I have written an essence concerning His remembrance, and it is this: He shall not be known by My allusions, nor by what hath been mentioned in the Bayan. Nay, by His glory, that word is, in God's estimation, greater than the worship of all who are on earth, for the essence of all worship leadeth unto this. Therefore, as thou hast known God, know Him Who shall be made manifest, for He is too glorious and exalted to be known except through Himself or to be described by the allusions of His creation. I am the first servant to believe in Him and His verses, and to partake of the choice fruits from the gardens of His words in the paradise of His knowledge. Yea, by His glory! He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, all abide by His bidding.\"\n\nBy God! This blessed word is the unique pearl of the ocean of the Bayan and the singular sun in the heaven of understanding, for it is an impregnable barrier against the Gog of ignorance and the Magog of passion. So sublime is this blessed word that the Ancient Beauty - glorified be His grandeur - hath made mention of it in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet revealed in honor of the revered Teacher, upon him be all the most glorious and resplendent glory. This word is as a sword against the wayward ones of the Bayan, leaving no room for objection by anyone.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Most astonishing of all is that none hath understood, nor doth understand, the root of the matter, yet they speak whatsoever their idle fancies prompt them to speak. Behold the baseness of their station, that some of the ignorant ones have sought to adduce proofs from \"Him Whom God shall make manifest\" while remaining deprived of His very Self. I testify that the Revealer of the Bayan disavoweth them. In the fifteenth chapter of the third Vahid of the Bayan, these blessed words are recorded. His exalted Word declares: \"None knoweth the time of the Revelation save God. Whenever it occurs, all must acknowledge the Point of Truth and render thanks unto God.\" He further states: \"The whole of the Bayan is but as a ring upon His blessed finger and a leaf among the leaves of His Paradise.\"\n\nNevertheless, the buzzing of flies hath been raised, and the ignorant ones of the earth cling to it. The Water of Life appeareth before all faces, yet the people remain heedless and veiled therefrom, turning instead to stagnant pools. Such is the condition of the people and of those who have taken for themselves lords other than God. It is as though they had never heard mention of the Day of God nor caught any fragrance thereof. Thus do they occupy themselves with the mention of idols and the manifestations of vain imaginings. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - declareth in one instance, these exalted words: \"Know thou that on that Day none shall be known except God, none worshipped but Him, none described save Him, none loved except Him, and none sought besides Him.\"\n\nThese blessed words cry out in the most exalted utterance between earth and heaven that today belongeth to God alone and is known and recorded in the divine Books as the Day of God - a Day wherein none is mentioned save Him. Yet now certain people occupy themselves with the vain imaginings of the past, which today have no mention or place in the Most Holy Court, and they have wished to veil the Sun of Grace behind the clouds of their idle fancies and to deprive the Divine Lamp of its light through tempestuous winds. Today is a different day and for it there is a different station. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to make known unto His servants what hath been concealed from them, to draw them nigh unto Him, and to bestow upon them that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His bounty. Verily, He is the Protector of them that remember Him and the Answerer of them that call upon Him.\n\nThese utterances of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - which were mentioned, this evanescent servant hath repeatedly set forth in petitions addressed to the friends of God, that perchance the souls that are veiled by vain imaginings might at least realize that this Day is sanctified and free from all limitations, veils, and whatsoever is possessed by men. He hath been and shall ever be known through His Own Self. No thing can frustrate Him, no cause can weaken Him, and no veil can conceal Him. Today most people are deprived of sight and hearing. Blessed is he who beholdeth Him with his own eyes, detached from all else but Him, and who knoweth Him by His Own Self, casting aside all else. I beseech the One True Goal that He may illumine the realm of knowledge with the lights of the sun of steadfastness and brighten the horizons of hearts with the Luminary of the All-Merciful's utterance. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThereafter, this evanescent servant attained unto another letter from that exalted personage dated the eighth of the month of Sha'ban. Praise be to God, it brought joy and delight. Later, at a certain time, it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient\n\nO My Afnan! We have desired to impart unto thee that which My Most Exalted Pen spoke aforetime in My first address to thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nHe is the Most Great \\[...\\]\n\nThe Promise hath come, and He Who was promised hath appeared, and the people are in evident turmoil. The ocean of life hath surged, yet they hasten unto death. The fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, yet they turn away therefrom. They have taken to the brackish water and cast aside the sweet flowing stream. What aileth them that they perceive not? They occupy themselves with dust, turning away from the Munificent Lord. Verily, they understand not. By God! Their eyes are blind and their ears are deaf; they neither hear nor see.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned to the Light and set his face toward God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling--he who heard the Call when it was raised in the kingdom of creation and hastened through the fields of divine good-pleasure until he recognized and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou God of the seen and unseen!\"\n\nSay: O people of Baha! Are ye slumbering, or hath the wine of selfish desire intoxicated you and prevented you from remembering God, the Lord of existence? Say: This is the Day of Rising--how is it that ye remain seated? This is the Day of the Call--how is it that ye remain silent? Arise in My Name, then speak with wisdom and utterance, that haply the people of possibility may turn unto the All-Merciful, Who calleth in this forbidden spot.\n\nSay: Have ye heard and remained patient? Fear God and be not of them that know not. Say: Turn ye, that ye may hear God's melody in the Kingdom of utterance. By My life! Were they to hear it, the rapture of yearning would seize them to such degree that they would dance and be unaware thereof. Say: Do ye reject the cup of immortality and take the fetid water of extinction from the hand of every rejected transgressor? Say: Hath the teacher of passion taught you this, or your own selves? Be truthful with Me, O people, and follow not every veiled prevaricator.\n\nArise with wisdom and remind the servants of what the Lord of creation hath commanded you, that perchance they may turn unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus hath My Pen spoken and My Tongue uttered and My limbs testified. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and taken the Tablet of God with the hand of power and drunk therefrom that which was inscribed in My Preserved Tablet.\n\nO thou who drinkest from My cup and speakest in My Name! Render thanks for what hath been sent down unto thee from the heaven of bounty, this sealed Book. O My Afnan! All atoms are witnessed in rapture and ecstasy at the divine call and the scratching of the Celestial Pen, while the heedless servants wander in the wilderness of idle fancies and vain imaginings.\n\nSay: By God's life! He cannot be known through aught else, nor can He be seen through any eye save His own. He is, verily, the News which none hath ever known before, and which no soul hath encompassed save God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: By God! This is indeed the Great News with whose mention the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, have been adorned. Say: What is with Him is not what is with you, nor doth He walk in your ways. He hath come with the truth and made manifest His straight path. His throne was established, at His first arrival, upon God's heights--thereby was fulfilled what was recorded in the Books of the Messengers.\n\nLand and sea have been honored by His presence, His meeting, and the fragrant breezes of His luminous garment. This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone, and wherein everything is weighed by the balance of God Who walketh and speaketh before the faces of the world. The Lord of Eternity hath come with manifest sovereignty. Say: The proof circleth round the Throne, and the evidence calleth out in His Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nO My Afnan! Drink from every letter of thy Lord's verses the wine of immortality, then give thanks to thy Lord, the Bountiful, the Most Generous. Then make mention of My loved ones on My behalf.\n\nIn the name of Him Who is the Mighty, the Inaccessible! O Afnan! Drink thou from every letter of thy Lord's verses the wine of everlasting life, then render thanks unto thy Lord, the Bountiful, the All-Generous. Then make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My grace and mercy, and remind them of that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an and the Bayan, and before them in the Torah and the Gospel. By God! There hath dripped from the chalice of Mine utterance the sealed wine which was described in the Book by One all-wise, all-knowing.\n\nThe praise be to God! The Tongue of Grandeur hath time and again manifested loving-kindness and bounty, and at the time of revelation, such was the surging of the ocean of utterance that this evanescent one beheld himself as but a tiny fish clinging to a rock. How then can he be capable of conveying that which the Tongue of God hath spoken? He wisheth to mention to the honored gentlemen that in these wondrous and exalted verses, mention hath been made of the Balance. Therefore, this evanescent servant desired to make mention of the Tablet of the Balance which was previously revealed, that all may attain unto the sweetness of divine utterance. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Knowing, the Responsive \\[...\\]\n\nThe Hour hath struck, and the Trumpet hath been blown, and the Balance proclaimeth: \"I am the All-Knowing Distinguisher. Before the face of all mankind do I reveal and manifest the deeds of the peoples, and I am the All-Informed Witness. Not an atom remaineth that I have not revealed, and I am the Just, the Upright One. The Hand of Justice hath made me to stand equitable in the Days of God, the Lord of all worlds.\" This is the Day whereon the Bugle doth sound, and the Bell doth ring, and the Trumpet proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Possessor of this wondrous Day.\"\n\nO thou that hearkeneth! When thou art blessed to hear the Tablet of thy Lord, turn thy face toward the Wronged One and say: \"May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy tribulations, O Thou Who hast spent all that Thou hadst in the path of God, the Most High, the Most Great.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant, in relation to what he presenteth, hath loved and continueth to love to make mention of whatsoever Divine utterances and heavenly verses come to his attention, for this servant is certain that His Holiness deriveth joy from their reading and beholding. This Day is the Day of remembrance and utterance, yet the heedless have no portion thereof. This is the Day whereof David spoke in the Psalms: \"Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains sing together for joy before the Lord, for He cometh to judge the earth.\"\n\nAll the divine Books are replete with mention of this blessed Day and that which hath been manifested therein. Yet it is observed that whatsoever hath been mentioned in the Books hath left no trace upon hearts harder than solid rock. Despite the explicit mention of the Divine Day and the Manifestation of God in previous Books, the people remain heedless and veiled. Consider the Bayan and its people. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - hath said: \"In the year nine ye shall attain unto the presence of God,\" and likewise He hath said: \"Then in the year nine ye shall attain unto all good.\" Nevertheless, some are seen to remain veiled from the Manifestation of God, despite how greatly His Holiness emphasized this matter, even saying that ye should not remain veiled from that Sun of Truth by the Bayan and the Vahid of the Bayan.\n\nHis word, exalted and glorified be He: \"Beware, beware on the day of His manifestation lest thou be veiled by the Vahid of the Bayan, for that Vahid is but a creation in His presence. And beware, beware lest thou be veiled by the words that have been revealed in the Bayan,\" unto the end of His blessed words. And in one place He saith - exalted be His remembrance: \"Whosoever looketh upon that Tree with other than the eye of God, for him the decree of salvation shall not be valid.\"\n\nNow the heedless people, with their veiled sight, have attempted to know God - glorified be He above what they imagine! And likewise in another place, these pearls of utterance have appeared from the ocean of knowledge of the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. His word, exalted and glorified be He: \"This is why none among the people of the Bayan shall attain salvation except through beholding Him Whom God shall make manifest in their own beings, not through beholding Him Who hath already been made manifest.\"\n\nObserve in this blessed verse how He hath taught the people. In explicit text He commandeth them to fix their gaze upon Him, not upon the Point of the Bayan. One of the Letters of the Living asked about Him Whom God shall make manifest - exalted be His grandeur and magnificent be His greatness. The Tongue of the Bayan expelled him with these words, glorified and exalted be He: \"How magnificent is the mention of Him about Whom thou hast asked, and verily that is more exalted and mightier and more glorious and more impregnable and more holy than can hearts attain unto His knowledge.\"\n\nAnd He is sanctified beyond the hearts knowing Him, or the spirits prostrating before Him, or the souls praising Him, or the bodies mentioning His glory. How great is your question and how small is your being! Does the sun which is in the mirrors of His manifestation in the Point of the Bayan ask about the Sun before Whom those suns on the day of His manifestation are prostrators before His countenance - if they were true suns, otherwise they would not be worthy of His exalted sanctity and sublime remembrance? Were it not that you were of the First Unity, I would have set a limit for you, since you have asked about God Who created you and sustained you and caused you to die and resurrected you in this your temple through the Point of the Bayan in that Manifestation unique in being.\n\nNow observe what level the deniers are on and what station the Cause occupies. Every thing beareth witness to His sanctification and exaltation above whatsoever the tongue of the world hath mentioned or will mention. This is a word which none will deny save every deluded doubter. He saith--exalted and glorified be His word: \"Perchance in the eighth year on the day of His manifestation thou wilt attain unto the presence of God. If thou attainest not at first, thou wilt attain at last. But be thou assured that the Cause is greater than every great thing, and that the Remembrance is mightier than every mighty thing.\" The addressee was Mulla Baqir, a Letter of the Living, upon him be the glory of God, to whom He saith that perchance in the eighth year thou wilt attain unto the presence of God, and if thou dost not attain this most mighty, most exalted, most glorious station at the beginning of the eighth, thou wilt attain unto His presence at its end, which coincideth with the beginning of the ninth. And this same Letter of the Living did attain the presence of God in the ninth year and twice directed his steps toward the Prison and attained His presence, and in these days he hath ascended unto the Supreme Horizon. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of the angels that draw nigh. Likewise did they give the glad tidings to Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the glory of God, that he would attain unto the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and this exalted address was revealed concerning him wherein He saith: \"Verily thou, O Third Letter that believeth in Him Whom God shall make manifest.\" And in the days when the Most Great Luminary rose above the horizon of Iraq, he attained unto the presence of the throne and was honored with the station of faith. Thereafter there befell him that which befell him. The curse of God be upon the people, the wrongdoers! Details regarding this wronged one have been revealed and recorded in the Book of Badi'. Now observe ye the Ancient King Who saith that all the Bayan is like a ring upon His finger which He turneth howsoever He willeth, through whatsoever He willeth, for whatsoever He willeth. And He saith: \"Be not veiled from that Sun of Truth by the whole of the Bayan and its Vahids.\" Despite this firm and irrefutable command, they have clung to a single word thereof, which is the name Mustaghath, and have remained deprived of the Purpose of the world. These attentive ears, penetrating eyes, enlightened breasts and illumined hearts say \"Know Him through Him and not through aught else.\" Yet what have they said and what have they done! And still they fail to perceive that they are forbidden but a word from the ocean of the Bayan and deprived by a single utterance from the Kingdom of divine utterance, and they remain wholly unaware of their deeds. They are occupied precisely with the games of Jabulqa and Jabulsa. Today, should He so will it, with but a single word He can cause whatsoever in the Bayan was confirmed to return to denial. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and shall not be asked of His doings. Verily He is powerful over all things. Even as the Primal Point--may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake--saith, exalted be His mention: \"It is permitted unto Him Whom God shall make manifest to reject him than whom there is none higher on earth, for this creation lieth within His grasp and all are obedient unto Him.\" He likewise hath power to endow all who are on earth with the raiment of prophethood, even as He saith, exalted be His mention: \"For verily were He to make all who are on earth prophets, they would become prophets before God.\" Here endeth the passage. All names are honored, glorified and ennobled through their turning unto Him; otherwise they are not worthy of mention.\n\nSay: The Prophet is he who hath hearkened unto My Call and believed in My Self, and the Apostle is he who hath delivered My Messages, and the Imam is he who hath stood before My countenance and prospered in My days, and the Guardian is he who hath entered the stronghold of My guardianship and detached himself from all else but Me, and the Successor is he who hath bequeathed unto himself and then unto the servants My love and remembrance. Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in this sacred, mighty, inaccessible and impregnable Paradise.\n\nAt this point the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - beseeches that whatsoever letters Thou hast numbered in the Bayan, save the Book of the Most High, Thou mayest transform and efface them, and in their stead create from the luminous letters whatsoever Thou lovest. And after sublime and transcendent utterances, He continues until it culminates in the Most Great Name, exalted be His grandeur. And it is most beloved to mention the original supplication of His Holiness, that all may partake of the Kawthar of utterance. His word, exalted and mighty be He:\n\n\"I beseech Thee by Thy grace, O my God, to adorn all my works in a mighty Book with the most excellent and impregnable calligraphy, than which there existeth none more exalted in Thy knowledge, in such wise that Thou mayest transform all the letters which Thou hast numbered, save the Book of the Most High, that Thou mayest efface them through Thy power and create in their place luminous letters according to what Thou lovest and art pleased with, in the uttermost heights above and beyond the most exalted horizon, until it culminateth in Thy Name, the Most Exalted, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious, the Most Beautiful, the Most High, the Most Splendid. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.\"\n\nBy God! Should any soul attain, in a measure beyond counting, unto fairness and insight, he would witness the fire of love of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - enkindled in the mention of the appearance of the Lord of Names, and would comprehend it. What benefit is there when the lethargy of heedlessness hath prevented the people from the ultimate purpose, the most exalted summit, and the furthermost goal? O Beloved of my heart! The fire that hath been kindled within this evanescent servant doth verily inspire him to these mentions, else the Truth, exalted be His glory, is sanctified and elevated above whatsoever hath been or may be mentioned. And by the testimony of the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - He hath not been and shall not be known by what is in the Bayan. Exalted be His greatness and His mention and His sovereignty! Likewise, it is hoped that some hesitant souls who wander in the wilderness of bewilderment and are bound by veils and allusions may perchance become aware and find their way to the straight path of God. The Command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nAnother submission is that his honor Aqa Muhammad Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, together with two others arrived and attained the Most Holy Presence, and the lamp that reflected the hearts of the pure ones arrived safely through them. However, until now the Ancient Beauty has not visited the garden. God willing, it shall be done according to the command. For some time the Most Great Prison was the seat of the Throne, and now it has been one month since the mansion has been honored and blessed by the Holy Footsteps. We beseech God, our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal, to ordain for your honor that which befitteth His Gracious Name. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The Glory be upon your honor from the presence of One Mighty, All-Knowing. The Most Great Branch and the Greater Branch - may my being and essence be a sacrifice unto the dust of Their feet - remember that beloved one with most exalted mention and convey Most Holy, Most Glorious greetings. Likewise all those who circle round the Prison Land, each one presents their utter nothingness and evanescence in service to your honor.\n\nAnother submission of this evanescent one is that in all conditions enjoin the friends of God to wisdom, lest they become heedless of it and be deprived of that which God hath intended. The day before, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words: \"O thou who art present! Let none comprehend the purpose of the sublime and glorious verses and imagine otherwise. Write to the Afnan to inform all that in no circumstance is the decree of wisdom abrogated.\" And concerning what was revealed in the verses \"This is the Day of awakening yet ye are sleeping\" and \"This is the Day of arising yet ye are seated\" - the intention is the teaching of God's Cause, that upright souls may arise to teach it with wisdom. By My Self that presideth over all things, nothing else was or is intended. And in answer to one of the friends, these firm and decisive passages were sent down from the heaven of oneness - they are mentioned so that all may become aware of God's grace, mercy and kindness, and fix their gaze upon that which He hath willed. His words, exalted be His grandeur:\n\n\"Beware, beware lest thou do what thou wrote at the end of thy letter. These are the deeds of the ignorant and the acts of the heedless. By the Most Great Name, should one of the friends cause harm to another, it is as though he hath harmed the Truth Itself. Conflict, contention, corruption, murder and the like have been strictly forbidden in God's Book. Repent unto God for what thou didst intend in thy soul, then turn to Him and say:\n\n'O my God! I beseech Thee by the Most Exalted Word to ordain for me the word of forgiveness, for I desired what Thou didst not desire and what Thou forbade in Thy Book. I beseech Thee to remit my sins and immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Thou art verily the Forgiving, the Generous.'\n\nWhatever wrong any oppressor hath manifested, leave him to the Truth Itself. Divine justice is all-pervading and all-encompassing. There hath not been and is no need for corruption, conflict, contention, murder and plunder. The triumph of the Cause hath been and shall be through utterance, and all else proceedeth from selfish desires. May God protect us and you, O concourse of those who have turned unto Him.\" End.\n\nLikewise in the Tablet of Ism'u'llah al-Jamal - may all glory from every Abha Glory be upon him - these blessed words were revealed, exalted be His grandeur and His truth: \"If all apparent power, which in truth has had and has no station before God, should become manifest, and if a swordsman should appear before us with evil intent, we would certainly not oppose him but would leave him to himself.\" A friend of God intended harm toward one of the people and mentioned his intention in a letter he sent to this servant. This servant presented it in the Most Holy Court, and the aforementioned revealed verses descended in reply to him from the heaven of God's will and were sent to him. God willing, may the Truth confirm all to relinquish their own desires and fix their gaze upon the Will of God. Verily He speaks the truth and guides the way, and praise be to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nAnother submission: The envelope for His Honor Ism'u'llah al-Jamal - may all glory from every Abha Glory be upon him - should reach him quickly. Haste is required. The Glory be upon you.\n\nThe Servant\n\n11 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1298\n\n=== END BH00033 ===\n\n=== START BH00034 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted!\n\nThe remembrance of God in the City of Patience concerning His servant Job, when We sheltered him beneath the sacred Tree in his heart and caused him to witness the Fire that was kindled and shone within his inmost being. We revealed Ourself to him through his own self, and called unto him from that Spot of God round about which blessing hath been vouchsafed, saying: \"Verily, He is God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things, and He is, in truth, powerful over all things, the Self-Subsisting.\" When his countenance was illumined by the Fire that burned within him, We clothed him with the garment of Prophethood and commanded him to summon the people to the Fountainhead of grace and bounty, and to call them to the shore of sanctified love. We established him in the earth and rained upon him the showers of bounty, and made him rich above all who dwell on earth. We bestowed upon him abundance of wealth and made him prosperous in the realm, and provided him with a portion of all things. We strengthened his arm with a company endued with power, and granted him sons of his own loins, and established him in an exalted station in the land.\n\nFor successive years he dwelt among his people, counseling them with the jewels of hidden knowledge wherewith We had taught him, and reminding them of the days that were destined to come. He said: \"O people! The oceans of knowledge have surged within the Self of God, Who standeth for justice - hasten ye thereunto that ye might find a way unto them. The Sun of loving-kindness hath truly risen and now standeth at its noontide height. The Beauty of the Divine Countenance hath appeared from behind the holy pavilions - present yourselves before Him that ye might be illumined by His beloved sanctified lights. The heavens of grandeur have been raised up and adorned with the stars of knowledge and wisdom - thus hath the Cause dawned from the holy horizon.\n\n\"O people! Messengers came unto you aforetime with God's messages and delivered unto you that which would guide you to the shore of exalted glory. The Hours have come in truth, the Lights have shone forth in justice, the Bird of Eternity hath warbled, the Dove of the Cause hath cooed, the clouds of Light have been upraised, the seas of grace have surged, yet ye, O peoples of the earth, have been deprived of all these things. Fear ye God, and spread not corruption in God's land of wisdom, but hearken unto the Word which hath descended from the heaven of nearness.\"\n\nThus did We counsel Our servants through the tongue of the Messengers from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end. Yet all turned away from God's counsel and retraced their steps, save those whom Our loving-kindness had preceded, who heard God's call from behind the veils of hidden glory, who answered God's summons with their inner and outer beings, and who were attracted by the melodies of the Beloved. These attained unto the stations of guidance - upon them be God's blessings and mercy. God granted them that which none knoweth and brought them to a station that was hidden from the eyes of all created things.\n\nGod shall soon manifest His Cause and separate truth from falsehood, raise up the banners of guidance and utterly demolish all traces of the idolaters. He shall cause His servants to inherit the earth - they who have detached themselves unto God and have not drunk the love of the Calf in their hearts, who have turned away from those who disbelieved and associated partners with God after clear proofs had come unto them from every direction. Thus hath the decree been inscribed by the Finger of Glory upon the Tablets of Light.\n\nRemember Our servant Job, when he appeared with the banners of wealth in the realm, and his people envied him and slandered him in their gatherings, and thus were their deeds preserved in the hidden scrolls. They imagined that he called upon God because of the ornaments of the world bestowed upon him, though he was sanctified above their imaginings and certitudes and above all in the realm together. When We desired to manifest the signs of truth in his detachment and his reliance upon God, We sent afflictions upon him from all directions and tried him with trials. We took from him his sons and cut off from him the bounty We had bestowed upon him in truth, and We took from him each day something known. Not a day passed except that there descended upon him from the direction of fate what was inscribed by the Pen of Decree. Misfortune and hardship seized him according to what was ordained by the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Then We burned what was harvested from his fields by the hands of the angels of command and made it all as scattered dust. When We had sanctified him from the ornaments of the realm and purified him from the filth of earth and cleansed him from all worldly conditions, We caused a scorching wind from the angels of wrath to blow upon his skin. Thereby his body weakened, his form was afflicted, and his members trembled to such extent that no part of his body larger than a dirham remained unwounded. Yet each day he increased in thankfulness, and he was patient at all times and did not lament what befell him. Thus did We account him among the trusting ones, the thankful ones, and the patient ones. His people drove him from the village wherein he dwelt, showing no shame before God their Creator, and they harmed him according to their power, and We found him oppressed in the earth. The gates of wealth were closed in his face and the gates of poverty were opened, until days passed and he found nothing with which to satisfy his hunger, and thus was the matter decreed for him. There remained for him neither companion nor friend nor associate, and he became solitary in the realm save for his wife who believed in her Lord and served him in his tribulation, and We made her a means for him in all matters. When his companion found him in that grievous state, she went to his people and asked of them a loaf of bread, but these embodiments of tyranny would not give it to her, and thus did We record all things in a clear book. When she was driven to extremity in her need, she went to one who was among the most evil of women on earth, who refused to give her a loaf until she took from her what she desired--and by God, the Pen is ashamed to mention it, and God was witness to their deeds. She came to the servant with a loaf, and when he looked upon her he found her hair cut off. Then did he cry out in his heart, and thereby the heavens and earth cried out, and he said: \"O handmaiden of God! I perceive in thee a matter forbidden to the truth. Why didst thou cut thy hair which God made the ornament of thy beauty?\" She said: \"O Job! Whenever I asked thy people for a loaf for thy sake, they all refused, until I entered the house of a handmaiden among the handmaidens of God and asked her for a loaf. She denied me until she took my hair and gave me this loaf which I have brought before thee. Thus did she transgress against God and show pride toward Him, and thus was the matter decreed between me and her. O Job! Forgive me.\"\n\nO Job! Pardon me and take me not to task for my sin, for I was helpless in Thy Cause. Have mercy upon me and forgive me, for Thou art verily compassionate and forgiving. And that which was decreed between them was decreed, and grief arose to such degree that the heavens were nigh to being cleft asunder, the earth of forbearance to be rent, and the mountain of patience to crumble. Then he laid his face upon the dust and said: \"O Lord! Affliction hath touched me from all sides, and Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all things. Have mercy upon me through Thy bounty and bestow upon me through Thy grace, for Thou art ever merciful unto Thy servants.\" When We heard his cry, We caused to flow beneath his right foot a spring of sweet, refreshing water, and We commanded him to immerse himself therein and drink therefrom. When he drank, he was healed of all ailments and appeared in the most excellent form. And We restored unto him all that We had taken from him, and more besides, such that We rained down upon him from the heaven of bounty that which enriched him above all who dwell on earth. We solaced his eyes through his family and fulfilled for him what We had promised to the patient ones in the preserved tablets of holiness. We set aright all his affairs and strengthened him with the arm of the Cause which was mighty in truth. Through him We exalted the lowly and destroyed those who had waxed proud before God and were wretched upon the earth. Thus do We do what We will by Our command, and fulfill the reward of the patient ones, and bestow upon them from the treasuries of holiness an abundant recompense.\n\nO concourse of earth! Be patient in God and grieve not for that which befalleth you in the days of the Spirit, for ere long shall ye witness the reward of the patient ones in a holy and inaccessible Paradise. God hath created a garden in the precincts of eternity and named it Patience, a name which until that day had been treasured in the repositories of infallibility. Therein hath He ordained that which He hath ordained in no other paradise, and We have now unveiled its covering and mentioned it unto you as a mercy from Us unto all the worlds. Therein are rivers of the shade of God's loving-kindness, which God hath forbidden unto all save those who have shown patience in tribulations, seeking the face of God, Who is in truth praiseworthy. None shall enter therein save those who have not altered God's favor unto themselves, who have entered beneath the shadow of the Tree of the Spirit, who have feared no one, and who have soared on the wings of glory in the atmosphere of patience. They have shown patience in afflictions, and the more tribulations increased upon their souls, the more did they grow in their love for their Lord. They turned with their whole being toward a holy and exalted direction, the ardor of longing grew intense in their breasts, and the breezes of spiritual taste increased in their souls, until they sacrificed themselves and gave up their possessions and spent all that God had bestowed upon them through His grace and bounty. And in all these severe conditions they remained thankful to their Lord and sought no one's help. God hath inscribed their names among the patient ones in the preserved tablets of holiness.\n\nBlessed then is he who is adorned with the robe of patience and steadfastness, who changeth not in adversity, whose feet slip not at the blowing of the winds of force, who is content with his Lord at all times and in Him ever trusteth. By God! He shall soon cause him to appear in the pavilions of grandeur, attired in a luminous garment that shall shine as shineth the light from the horizon of the Spirit, in such wise as to dazzle all eyes that behold it. And above his head shall the herald of God proclaim: \"This is he who showed patience in God during the vain life of this world despite all that the idolaters wrought against him.\" The denizens of the highest paradise shall seek his blessing, and the dwellers of the chambers and the chaste-eyed damsels in the tabernacles of beauty shall yearn for his presence.\n\nO people of the Bayan! Be patient in these fleeting days and grieve not for what hath escaped you of worldly ornaments, neither be ye troubled by the hardships of affairs which were ordained in the scrolls of divine power. Know ye that for all good deeds a limited recompense hath been ordained in the Book, save for patience. Thus was its decree established aforetime through Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Verily, the patient shall be paid their reward without measure. Thus did the Spirit of Truth descend upon the heart of Muhammad in the Arabic tongue, and thus was revealed in all the Tablets what was ordained for the patient ones in wondrous books of glory. Know ye then that God hath made patience the garment of the Messengers, such that He hath sent no Prophet or Messenger save that God adorned His temple with the robe of patience, that He might be patient in the Cause of God. Thus did God take the covenant from every Prophet sent forth. It behooveth the patient one at the outset to be patient with his own self, such that he restraineth himself from tyranny, indecency, and lusts, and from all that God hath forbidden in the Book, that he may be recorded in the Tablets among the patient ones. Then must he be patient in the tribulations that descend upon him in the path of his Creator, neither being disturbed when the winds of destiny blow and the seas of power surge in the dominion of execution. He must remain steadfast in the religion of God and be patient with what cometh upon him from his loved ones, showing fortitude regarding those who have believed, seeking the face of God, that he may be well-pleasing in the religion of God. Await ye then the day when the clouds of patience shall be lifted up, and the Bird of Eternity shall warble, and the Sacred Peacock shall appear with the ornament of the Command in the Kingdom of Meeting, and the weary tongues shall be loosed in the melodies of the Dove, and the Dove of Paradise shall hover between earth and heaven, and the trumpet shall be sounded, and the temples of existence shall be renewed, and the fire shall be kindled, and God shall come overshadowing from the Spirit with a beauty of impregnable glory. Then hasten ye unto Him, O peoples of the earth! Be not occupied with aught in the kingdom, let not the prohibition of any prohibitor prevent you, neither let scientific affairs veil you, nor rational proofs obstruct you. Hasten ye to an exalted and holy retreat, for if ye tarry in the endless beginning of beginnings and hesitate on that Day less than a moment, the decree of patience shall not apply to you. Thus hath the decree been sent down from the Pen of the All-Knowing Glory. Say: O people of the earth! Fear ye God in these days and fabricate not against His trusted ones, and say not that of which ye have no knowledge, for ye are powerless in the earth and destitute in the lands. Be not proud within yourselves, but hasten to the land which was in truth accepted. By God! This world shall pass away and all wherein ye rejoice, and the angels of divine wrath shall gather you together before a mighty and powerful sovereign King, and ye shall be questioned concerning what ye did in your days, and nothing shall be left of what is in the heavens and the earth save that it is recorded in the Tablet of Knowledge. Then shall no one avail you, nor shall any soul plead for you, nor shall aught profit you save what ye have sown in the fields of your deeds. Be ye wakeful, O company of the wretched! Then hearken to the counsel of this Kind Friend Who counseleth you for the sake of God and desireth from you neither recompense nor thanks. His reward is only with Him Who sent Him with the truth and revealed unto Him the verses, that His proof might be complete unto all the worlds. How long will ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness\\[...\\]\n\nHe hath sent down unto him verses that His proof might be made complete unto all the worlds. How long will ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness? How long will ye follow those who are naught on earth but as worthless insects? Say: By God! Those whom ye have taken as lords besides God - their names and their beings are not even mentioned before God. Have mercy, therefore, upon your own selves and fear God, your Creator. Then turn unto Him, that He may forgive you your evil deeds, for verily He is forgiving toward His servants. Say: By God! Those to whom ye attribute knowledge and whom ye have taken as your learned ones - these are, in God's sight, the most wicked of men; nay, the very essence of wickedness fleeth from them. Thus hath it been inscribed in the scrolls of knowledge. We testify that they have not drunk from the fountains of knowledge, nor have they attained to a single letter of wisdom, nor have they penetrated the mysteries of the Cause, but have remained immersed in the land of their own desires. No Prophet, nor Successor, nor Holy One hath ever been opposed or denied save by their leave. Thus have they passed judgment against the Manifestations of Holiness.\n\nSay: O concourse of the ignorant! Did We not reveal aforetime \"the Day when God will come in the shadows of the clouds\"? Yet when He came in the clouds of the Cause in the temple of 'Ali, in truth, ye turned away and waxed proud and were a ruined people. Was it not revealed \"the Day when thy Lord cometh, or some of the signs of thy Lord\"? And when He came with clear signs, why did ye turn away therefrom and remain veiled behind the veils of self? Say: God is sanctified from coming and descent. He is the Single, the All-Sufficing, Whose knowledge encompasseth all who are in the heavens and on earth. He will never come in His Essence, nor be seen in His Reality, nor be known in His Identity, nor be comprehended in His Attributes. He Who cometh is the Manifestation of His Self, even as He came in truth in the name of 'Ali, yet ye gathered against Him with the claws of hatred and pronounced judgment against Him, O concourse of divines, and were not ashamed before Him Who created you and fashioned you. Thus have We recorded your deeds in preserved tablets of glory.\n\nO Ear of Immortality! Hear what these polytheists say: that God hath sealed Prophethood with His beloved Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and will never raise up anyone after Him, and that His hands are bound from bestowing grace, and that no more shall the Temples of Holiness appear after Him, and that the lights of grace shall no longer shine forth, and that divine outpouring hath ceased, and power hath ended, and loving-kindness hath terminated, and the gates of bounty are sealed, though the breezes of bounty have ever wafted from the paradise of might. Say: Your hands are bound, and ye are accursed for what ye have said. Nay, His hands encompass all who are in the heavens and on earth. He raises up whom He willeth through His power, and He shall not be questioned of His doings, for verily He hath power over all things.\n\nSay: O people of the Qur'an! Reflect upon the Book which was sent down in truth to Muhammad, wherein He sealed Prophethood through His Beloved until the Day of Resurrection - this Resurrection wherein God hath arisen in the Manifestation of His Self, while ye remained veiled therefrom, even as the peoples of the earth were veiled from the Resurrection of Muhammad aforetime, and ye were submerged in the depths of heedlessness and aversion. Say: Were ye not promised the meeting with God in His days? Yet when the promise was fulfilled and Beauty shone forth from the horizon of Glory, ye closed your eyes and were gathered on the plain of assembly, blind. Say: Hath it not been revealed in the Qur'an through His true Word: \"Thus have We made you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the Messenger may be a witness against you\"? Ye have interpreted this verse according to your own desires, while firmly believing and acknowledging that which was revealed in truth, that none knoweth its interpretation save God and those firm in knowledge. Yet despite your conviction in this, ye have interpreted the words of God and explained them after having been forbidden to do so, and have risen in opposition and denial against those firm in knowledge. Nay, ye slay them as ye slew them aforetime, and ye rejoice in your deeds. Shame upon you for that which your hands have wrought and for your thoughts concerning God's Cause on a day when the lights of guidance were manifest from the dayspring of knowledge. Ask them then how they read that which was sent down from the heaven of might unto Muhammad in the Arabic tongue, and what they say concerning the meaning of \"middle\" if Prophethood was sealed through Him - how then was His community described in the Book as the middle of nations? Know then their measure, as though they had never heard the cooing of the Dove, and even had they heard it they would not have understood. Thus was the proof from their own Book conclusively established against them. And this is what all peoples have declared in the time of every Prophet: whenever Messengers from God came unto them, they said \"Thou art no Messenger,\" and claimed Prophethood was sealed with Him who came before. Thus did Satan make their deeds and words seem fair unto them, and they were far removed from the shore of truth. Remind them of the account of Muhammad aforetime, when He came with manifest authority. He said: \"O people! These are the signs of God which have been sent down in truth. Dispute not concerning God's Cause, but gather ye upon the shore of transcendent glory.\"\n\nO people! Look upon Me with the eye of God, and follow not your idle fancies, nor be like those who called upon God by day and by night, yet when He came unto them they turned away from Him and denied Him, remaining utterly devoted to the idols of their own selves. The Jews declared: \"By God, this is he who hath fabricated a lie against God, or he is possessed of a demon, or is under a spell.\" They said: \"God hath sealed Prophethood with Moses, and this is God's decree as set forth in the Torah. The Law of the Torah shall never be abrogated throughout God's eternity, and he who shall come after must arise to promote its laws unto all who dwell on earth.\" Thus was the command sent down from the heaven of divine decree unto Moses. And those who were given the Gospel spoke likewise, and remained expectant from that day until this. God banished them by that which He revealed unto Muhammad, the Arabian, in the Surih of the Jinn: \"They imagined, as ye imagined, that God would never raise up anyone after him.\" By God! This verse that hath been sent down, and the mysteries of God concealed therein, suffice all who dwell on earth, if they would but walk in the paths of recognized glory. Say: God hath raised up Messengers after Moses and Jesus, and will continue to send them until the end that hath no end, such that the outpourings of grace may never cease to rain from the heaven of divine bounty. He doeth what He willeth and is not asked of what He doeth, while all else shall be questioned concerning all things in the presence of justice. Hear then what these objectors say, imagining concerning God as did those servants who came before. Say: By God! The matter hath become confused for you. The Hour hath come to pass in truth, and the Resurrection hath arisen, despite your wishes and the wishes of those who were deaf to the melodies of God. Say: Ye speak as spoke the peoples of old in the time of God's Messenger, and ye wait as they waited, and your feet have slipped on this Path that hath been stretched forth in truth. Reflect then on the implications of this verse, that ye may receive your portion from the table of knowledge that descendeth from the heaven of holiness according to a decreed measure.\n\nO Solace of Eternity! Witness what the idolaters testify concerning this Tree that hath put forth leaves, this blessed Tree that hath been raised up upon the mountain of musk, whose branches have grown until they reached the station that was concealed behind the pavilions of holiness. These idolaters desire to cut off its boughs. Say: It hath sought refuge in God's stronghold and protection, and God hath caused the hands of the hypocrites and unbelievers to fall short of reaching it. The hands of those who have disbelieved and turned away shall never attain unto it. God shall soon gather beneath its shade all who are in the kingdom, and this is what the Truth hath prescribed for Himself, and this hath been irrevocably sealed in the tablets of glory by the Pen of Knowledge.\n\nO Solace of Beauty! Remind the servants with spiritual remembrances in these days, then let them hear a melody from the melodies of eternity, that they may perchance perceive in themselves something less than a mote, and that they may not suppose as their associates supposed before, and may be assured that God is able to raise up a Messenger in every age. Say: O assemblage of hatred! Die in your wrath! This is what hath been decreed in truth by the Pen of transcendent glory. Therefore cast upon them that which the Dove of the Spirit warbled in the paradise of holy and beloved beauty, that they may follow what was explained in the Seal by the tongue of him who was firm in knowledge concerning the visitation of God's name, 'Ali. He said--and His word is the truth--\"The Seal of what has gone before and the Opening of what is to come.\" Thus did he mention the meaning of the Seal with an eloquent holy tongue. Even so did God make His Beloved the Seal of the Prophets who preceded Him and the Opening of the Messengers who would come after. Therefore ponder, O people of the earth, on what We have cast upon you in truth, that ye may perchance find a way to the source of the Cause on the holy shore. Be not veiled from what ye have heard from your learned ones, then ask concerning the matters of your religion from him whom God hath made firm in His knowledge, and from whose countenance the lights were resplendent and luminous. O people! Fear God and take not knowledge from turbid springs which flow from the direction of self and ignorance. Take it rather from the flowing, palatable, pure, running, sweet springs which stream from the right hand of the Throne, and of which God hath given the righteous their portion. O Dayspring of Holiness! Bestow upon all contingent beings that which God hath bestowed upon thee through His bounty, that they may arise from the sepulchres of their bodies and become aware of the Cause which hath in truth come to pass. Then send upon them from the perfumed, musk-laden breezes which God hath given thee in the particles of eternity, that perchance thereby the decayed bones may be quickened, and that the people may not deprive themselves of this Spirit which hath been breathed from this ancient, eternal, everlasting Pen, and may be gathered in this good and blessed land before God in the most beauteous form.\n\nO Pen of Command! Thou dost witness and behold how all created things, in infinite oceans, turn away from this all-encompassing, outpouring mercy that hath enveloped all who are in the heavens and on earth. They turn not toward the countenance from which the lights of the Spirit have dawned, by which all in the kingdoms of command and creation were illumined - and of this thou art indeed witness. They run in the valley of self and desire, and wade among those who attained not Thy presence in Thy Day, after Thou didst give them glad tidings aforetime through a glorious and mighty Pen, and Thy sweet utterance in the heaven of eternity declared: \"On that Day all sovereignty shall be God's.\" Thus was the decree of that Day inscribed upon tablets of glory by the finger of the Spirit from time immemorial. But when the Day came and the hours arrived and the matter was accomplished and the lights of Beauty were established at the meridian, then all rose up in hypocrisy against this Light that shone forth from the horizon, and veiled themselves behind thick veils of unbelief. Thus may ye recognize all peoples throughout all ages: after they awaited that which was promised in the days of God, when the promise was fulfilled they denied it through what Satan cast into their souls, and remained far removed from the holy shore. Even as ye witness today these idolaters who waited in their days for what was promised by the tongue of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and whenever they heard His name they would rise up and cry \"May God hasten His advent!\" Yet when He appeared in truth they denied Him in their souls and opposed Him and disputed with Him falsely and imprisoned Him amid the mountains. The rancor of their hearts and the fire of their souls was not quenched until they perpetrated against Him that which caused the very livers of existence to be consumed in the temples of being, whereby the pillars of the cities of eternity were shaken in the heaven of blindness, and the Beauty of the Unseen lamented in Its hidden sanctum of holiness. O Day-spring of Glory! Make mention to the believers among the people of eternity what the idolaters spoke in former times in the days when Husayn was slain by the embodiments of tyrannical wickedness. They would visit his shrine each day and curse those who oppressed him, and would recite a hundred times each morning \"O God! Curse the first oppressor who oppressed the right of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad!\" Yet when Husayn was raised up in the holy land, they oppressed him and killed him and did unto him what none had done before. Thus doth God distinguish between the truthful and the false, between light and darkness, and cast upon you that which revealeth all the deeds of the oppressors.\n\nRemember then in the Book one who was a pious servant of God, who believed in God on a day when the Cause shone forth resplendently from the Dayspring of the Spirit, and who aided his Lord to the extent of his power at the time when the Vahid entered the eastern land of love. He said: \"O people! God's proof hath come with the truth and the Face hath appeared. O concourse of the Furqan! Hasten unto Him and turn not back upon your heels. O people! Beauty hath dawned from the horizon of holiness and the Promise hath come with truth. Hasten ye unto the Paradise wherein that Face shineth with radiance. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves and your eyes from the meeting with God, for this is God's Day, a day grievous unto the unbelievers. O people! The Book hath been set down in truth, and the deeds of all in the world shall not escape it by so much as a date-stone's weight or a date-thread. O people! Be not veiled from the Beauty of God after He hath come overshadowed by clouds, with holy angels round about Him - thus was the matter decreed from before the Throne.\"\n\nAnd when the Vahid said: \"O people! I have brought you a Tablet from the Spirit, from before the Self-Subsisting. Be not divided in God's Cause, but answer the call of Him Who summons you with pure truth and teaches you that which will draw you nigh unto the right hand of glory beloved. O people! In all the Tablets ye were promised the meeting with God, and this is the day wherein Beauty is unveiled, the Light hath appeared, the Herald hath called out, and the heaven hath been cleft asunder with clouds. Fear ye God and close not your eyes to a Beauty brilliant as the morning star. This is what ye were promised by the tongue of the Messengers aforetime, and God took from you a covenant concerning this in the realm of pre-existence. Therefore fulfill your covenants and be not detained in the lands of allusion.\"\n\nAmong the people, some fulfilled God's covenant and answered the call of Truth, while others turned away and were rebellious against God. And among them was he who was named 'the Pious One' in the Book, who believed in God his Lord and was faithful to His promise. He appeared before the Vahid and held fast to the Most Great Handle, divided not God's word, and remained steadfast in the true religion. He aided his Lord in all conditions with all that lay within his power, and thus did God cause his name to be inscribed by the Pen of Glory in the lines of eternity. Tribulation and adversity befell him, and he bore all hardships in his own person, yet in all these conditions remained thankful and patient. Verily they who aid God with their wealth and their persons, and who endure hardships seeking God's face - these were from all eternity victorious through God's help, even though they be slain and burnt on earth, for they were created from spirits and soared in the atmosphere of the Spirit by God's leave. They pay no heed to their physical bodies in this realm and long for trials in their Creator's path as the guilty long for forgiveness and the infant for its mother's breast. Thus doth the Dove remind you with spiritual remembrances, that perchance the people may detach themselves from their selves and their wealth, and return to a holy and manifest seat.\n\nThe days passed until there gathered around Vahid a band from the village which God had blessed among all villages and had exalted its name in the Tablet from which the Mother Book had been separated. They followed God's decree and circled round His Cause, spent their wealth and sacrificed all the ornaments they possessed, fearing none but God - and God is indeed aware of all things. Their hearts were as blocks of iron in God's aid, the blame of no blamer took hold of them, nor did the rejection of any rejecter prevent them. In the cities of the earth they were like sacred banners raised in God's Name. The matter reached such a point that the chief of oppression, who had denied God, associated partners with His Beauty and turned away from His proof - and who was the most wretched of people on earth, as testify to this the men who were concealed in the pavilion of eternity - heard of it.\n\nO people of the village! Give thanks to God your Creator for having favored you with the truth and preferred you above all who dwell on earth, in that He honored you with His presence, made you know His Self, and nourished you from the fruits of the Lote-Tree of Paradise after all had been deprived thereof. He caused you to attain His days, sent upon you the breezes of holiness, turned you toward the right hand of oneness, and drew you near to the blessed spot of glory. Thus does He bestow His favor upon whomsoever He willeth and singles out for His mercy such servants as are cut off from all who dwell on earth. Therefore rejoice within yourselves and take pride over all who are gathered in the kingdom.\n\nKnow that God has inscribed your names in the holy scrolls and ordained for you in Paradise a praiseworthy station. By God! Were the station of but one of you to be revealed to those on earth, they would sacrifice their souls in their longing for this station which was created by God's hand. But it has been veiled from the eyes of men that the evil might be distinguished from the good. Thus does God try them in the kingdom that what lies in their hearts might be revealed, as indeed it has been revealed, and you were witness to this. How many were the servants who worshipped God in their days, commanded people to righteousness and piety, wept over the tribulations of the family of God, and closed their eyes in prayer and in reciting visitations to show their orientation toward a holy, worshipped Source! Yet when the truth came to them they turned away from it and denied it, even to the point of killing it with their own hands, and they were delighted with their deeds. Thus does God render void the deeds of those who showed pride against Him, and accepts the deeds of those who turned to God, humbled themselves before His countenance, and walked the paths of His good-pleasure.\n\nRemember, O people of the village, the bounty of God which He hath in truth bestowed upon you, and taught you that which none of the divines of the earth have known - they who, by reason of the weight and size of their turbans, can scarcely walk upon the earth, and when they move, they move as though a mountain of hatred doth move across the land, detested. By God! It behooveth you, O friends of God, to sanctify yourselves from all that ye have been forbidden, and to thank God throughout all days and nights for having singled you out with a grace whereof others have no share, and to speak of God, your Creator, in such wise that the fragrance of God may waft from you, and ye may thus be distinguished from those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God. Thus doth the Dove counsel you and teach you the paths of knowledge, that ye may be firmly grounded in God's religion and steadfast in His love. Fear God, and let not your deeds be rendered vain through heedlessness, and boast not to God of your faith in the Manifestation of His Self; rather God bestoweth His favor upon you in that He hath aided you in His Cause, shown you the paths of glory and piety, and inspired you with wondrous and hidden knowledge. Well is it with you, O people of the village, for having been patient in God's days through hardship and tribulation, and for having heard with your ears and witnessed with your eyes. God shall soon reward you with the most excellent of rewards and grant you that which shall satisfy your souls, and shall inscribe your names in a holy and hidden Book. Strive, then, that your patience be not nullified through complaint, and be content with whatsoever God hath decreed for you and with all that He shall decree hereafter, for the world and its ornaments and embellishments shall pass away in less than a moment and shall not endure, and ye shall be brought into a seat of glory well-beloved. Blessed are ye and those who have sacrificed themselves in the days of God and were among those who soared in the atmosphere of love and attained unto a station that was forbidden to all others.\n\nWherefore, O Pen of Holiness, make mention of what befell the Vahid at the hands of the enemies of God's own Self, that his cause may be remembered in the Concourse on High with truth. When he who disbelieved and was wretched, then grew arrogant and rebellious, heard thereof, he dispatched the hosts of infidelity and commanded them to slay those the like of whom the earth had never borne in their faith in God, and to shed blood whereby all things were purified. The wicked one gave commands among the people contrary to what God had revealed in the Book, and thus was his decree irrevocably fixed. He appointed two chiefs over the hosts, who denied God and His signs, and sold their religion for worldly gain, thereby purchasing for themselves everlasting and perpetual torment, and through their tyranny were destined for God's wrath. They came with the hosts of infidelity and the armies of idolatry until they besieged God's hosts and His loved ones, and were inscribed by the Pen of Command in the Mother Book as the most evil of men. They warred against God's companions, disputed with them, contended with them, and fought with all their might to overcome the hosts of truth, but God caused them to be defeated at the hands of the believers in their battle. When they proved powerless against the party of God and His friends, they plotted and schemed within themselves and took counsel together until they sent a messenger to the Vahid with deceitful words. The messenger of Satan entered unto the Vahid and said: \"You are the son of Muhammad and we acknowledge your excellence over us. We have not come to contend with you, but rather we desire reconciliation in your cause. We will hear what you command us and follow your word, and we will not oppose your judgment in the least degree.\" Then the Spirit opened Its mouth and the Holy Spirit spoke through the tongue of the Vahid, saying: \"O people! If you acknowledge my excellence and recognize that I am the son of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, why have you come against us with the hosts of infidelity and besieged us, turning away from God's Cause and rebelling against it? O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the land, cast not God's Cause behind your backs, and fear God Who created you and sustained you and sent down unto you wondrous verses of might. O people! The kingdom and your hosts shall perish, then he who sent you with tyranny. Consider what befell the nations of old and be mindful of matters that were decreed aforetime. O people! I am but a servant who has believed in God and His verses revealed through the tongue of Ali in truth. If you are not content with my presence among you, I will depart unto God. I desire nothing from you. Fear God and shed not the blood of His loved ones, seize not people's property unjustly, and deny not God after having claimed faith for yourselves. Thus do I counsel you with justice; follow my counsel and stray not from the Cause which has dawned from the horizon of the Spirit. O people! Would you slay a man for saying 'My Lord is God,' when he has brought you signs that confound the minds of all creation? Have mercy on yourselves and follow not your desires. You shall depart from this transient world and appear before the presence of the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. You shall be questioned concerning what you did on earth and be recompensed for all that you wrought in the false dominion. This is what hath been irrevocably decreed in the mighty tablets.\"\n\nThus was His decree established in the Tablets with invincible might. Messages and missives were repeatedly exchanged between them until they set forth God's Book amongst themselves, swore by it, sealed it and dispatched it to the Beauty of Glory, the Vahid. Thus did they seek to practice deception in God's Cause, making promises with their tongues that were absent from their hearts. The hatred in their breasts was like a fire concealed behind veils of deceit. They beseeched Vahid to honor their places and gatherings with his presence, emphatically renewing their covenant and pledge, while they lay sleeping upon the couch of self and passion.\n\nWhen God's Book came before Vahid, he arose and proclaimed to those around him: \"O people! The promised time has come and destiny's decrees have been fulfilled in truth. I shall go to them that what lies ordained for me behind the pavilion of destiny may be made manifest.\" Thus did he ever place his trust in his Lord. Vahid entered among the hosts of tyranny and the armies of Satan with but a few souls. They arose to welcome him, giving him precedence over themselves in walking and sitting, and he remained among them for numbered days. Through him they wrote to the people of the village to disperse, assuring them they would not be harmed, until they had scattered them. Then the forces of unbelief entered their quarter and practiced a mighty deception against them.\n\nWhen their hearts and souls were at ease, they broke their covenant, violated their pledge, transgressed God's decree among them, and breached the Book's covenant through their passions. Thus were their names inscribed as accursed in the Tablets by God's Pen. They seized Vahid, violated his sanctity, stripped his body, and perpetrated such acts as caused the eyes of the denizens of Paradise to shed crimson tears. God's curse be upon those who wronged him and those who continue to commit injustice in these days when the Sun is veiled behind sacred clouds. Not content with what they had done, they slew the villagers over successive years, took their women captive, plundered their possessions, and showed no fear of God Who created and nurtured them. They vied with one another in oppression and in what Satan cast into their hearts, while God witnessed their deeds.\n\nThey raised heads upon spears and lances and entered the land which God had honored above all other regions of earth, wherein the All-Merciful was established upon the throne of a magnificent Name. When they arrived in the city, people gathered around them - some reviling them with their tongues, others stoning them with their hands - while the dwellers of the heavens bit their fingers in astonishment at what these polytheists had done to these radiant and luminous countenances. They brought them into the city, and God knows what befell them after their entry, for He keeps account of all things in a noble and precious Book.\n\nO Divine Beauty! This is not the first time that the idolaters have acted thus on earth. They slew Husayn and his companions, then took his family captive, and now they weep and lament for him morning and evening. Say: O concourse of brutes! Have ye not inferred the truth of Husayn and his companions from how they sacrificed themselves and gave up their possessions, and ye were mindful of this? How then do ye brand these martyrs with unbelief after they gave up their wealth and their women in the path of God and strove therein until they were slain in diverse ways such as no ear hath heard and no eye of creation hath collectively witnessed? And when it is said unto them, \"Why did ye slay those who believed in God and His signs?\" they say, \"We found them to be unbelievers in the land.\" Say: By God! Thus did these same words issue from your mouths aforetime against the Prophets and Messengers until ye slew them with the sharpened swords of hatred, and God doth encompass all things. Woe unto you for having denied God's Messengers and risen up to wage war against them until ye shed their blood without right, as attesteth what hath been inscribed upon the Tablets, preserved and hidden. Say: Hath not God established in His Book that which distinguisheth between the truthful and the liar through His true word \"Then wish for death, if ye speak truth\"? Why then did ye deny those whose truthfulness God hath attested in His Book, which no falsehood can approach and which was sent down from the Tablet? Ye perceived it not, cast God's Book behind your backs, and slew those who wished for death in God's path - to this your eyes, your tongues and your hearts bear witness, and beyond all this God is the Witness. Shame upon you for having shed the blood of those the like of whom the eyes of creation have never seen, and for having denied them after their truthfulness was confirmed by the explicit text of the Book, and for having followed those who would not consent to the diminution of even an atom of their prestige in God's path, and whose only concern in this world is to consume the wealth of the people and to occupy the highest seats in assemblies, thereby priding themselves above all who dwell on earth. By God! It behooveth you to take these transgressors as your lords instead of God and to follow them until ye enter with them into the fire that was created for the idolaters. Say: By God! If ye were to become aware for less than a moment, ye would destroy your books which ye have written without God's leave, strike your heads, flee from your homes and dwell in the mountains, eating naught but fetid black mud.\n\nSay: The souls of those who were martyred upon the earth have taken flight, and now they soar in the atmosphere of nearness and circle round the mighty throne. At every moment the angels of grace descend upon them and give them tidings of a station of praiseworthy glory. Each day God reveals Himself to them with such splendor that were it to appear to the dwellers of earth and heaven, they would fall down unconscious. Say: O assemblage of the wretched! Rejoice not in your deeds, for soon shall you return to God and be gathered before His glory on the Day when the pillars of all creation shall quake. God will then call you to account in His justice for what you have wrought against His loved ones in the days of falsehood. Not a single deed of yours shall be overlooked but shall be laid bare before you. You shall be rewarded according to your works, for nothing escapes God's knowledge and He encompasses all things.\n\nThe wrongdoers in the nethermost depths of the fire shall say: \"Would that we had not taken these divines as our friends!\" O people of the village! Remember God's favor upon you when you were on the brink of the abyss of unbelief, and He saved you through His grace and guided you to the court of His unique Name. When you were enemies, He united your hearts, brought you together in truth, exalted your name, and sent down verses unto you from a tongue of beloved glory. Remember too when We passed by you with hosts of angels and opened unto you the gates of Paradise. You were gathered when passing by the fortress, but Satan whispered to some among you and cast terror into your hearts. Then We found some of you disturbed and shaken, but We pardoned those who were troubled, as a mercy from Us upon you and upon all who dwell on earth.\n\nSay: Those who have disbelieved among the people of the village are the most evil of men, just as you are the best of servants. Thus have We recorded the matter in a Tablet sealed with the seal of glory. Those who did not present themselves before Vahid, who warred against him and disputed with him falsely - these are cursed in this world and the next, and the word of punishment from One mighty and wise is decreed against them.\n\nO loved ones of God from that village! Hold fast to the cord of God, then thank Him for having chosen you in truth. You have become, through God's mercy, steadfast upon the paths of holiness. O trees of the village! Prostrate yourselves before God your Creator, for the breezes of spring in a season of unique glory have wafted over you. O earth of that village! Thank your Lord, for God has transformed you on the Day of Resurrection and the lights of the Spirit have shone upon you from a horizon of glorious light. O air of the village! Remember God, Who has purified you from the dust of self and passion, raised you up in truth and caused you to be presented before Him.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Yahya, for having fulfilled thy covenant on the day when the heavens and earth were created. Thou didst take the Book of God with the power of thy faith and wert drawn by the melodies of His days to the sanctuary of Beauty. Then did the Concourse on High give thee glad tidings of what was recorded in a Tablet to which clung the spirits of the Books and beyond them the Mother Book, which was preserved in the fortress of infallibility. Thus doth God reward His servants who have believed in Him and His verses, and He seizes those who have wronged on earth. Verily, the curse of God be upon all wrongdoers.\n\nO Delight of Eternity! Change thy melody and chant with the notes of the warbling doves from behind the pavilions of names in the heaven of attributes, that perchance the birds of the Throne may detach themselves from the dust of their own selves and wing their flight to their true habitation in that station which is sanctified above all sanctification. O Essence of Truth! Sing and trill with the sweetest of melodies, for the maidens of Paradise have emerged from their chambers and from the pavilions of God's protection to hearken unto thy song which was chanted concerning the tales of truth in the Qayyumu'l-Asma'. Deprive them not of what they seek from the wonders of thy bounty, for verily thou art the Generous One in the precincts of eternity and the Lord of great bounty in the heaven of the unseen, and thy name hath been known for bounty in the Supreme Concourse.\n\nO Beauty of Holiness! The idolaters will not allow this melody to issue forth from this soul, and when the voice seeketh to emerge from my mouth, they place upon it the hands of hatred. Yet Thou, despite Thy knowledge of this, commandest me to raise the call in the atmosphere of this heaven. Verily Thou art the Doer of what Thou willest, the Judge of justice, doing what Thou pleasest and remaining wise over all things. And shouldst Thou hear Thy servant's call and fulfill his need through Thy grace, then excuse them with the most gracious words and gentlest utterance, that they may return to their pavilions and their seats in the chambers of crimson ruby. Thou knowest that I am tried amongst the idolaters of both parties, and Thou art the Ruler of both causes, the Observer of both judgments, the One manifest in both garments, the One dawning with both suns, the One mentioned by both names, the Lord of both Easts, the Commander of both mysteries in both lines, and God is, beyond what I say, All-Knowing. Thou knowest that I fear not for myself, for I have sacrificed my soul and spirit on the day when Thou didst honor me with Thy presence, taught me the wonders of Thy beauty, and inspired me with the gems of Thy verses, gathered upon all who have entered beneath the shadow of Thy Cause. Rather, I fear lest the pillars of the Cause be scattered by the Most Great Word, even as these deluded ones scattered them on the day when Thou didst establish Thyself upon the thrones of existence through Thy mercy which encompasseth all in the worlds collectively. Thus have We detailed this matter in detail on the day which was then sent down from the heaven of the Spirit.\n\nO Blood-Drenched Robe! Pay no heed to the signs, then burn the veils, then appear adorned with the ornament of God between earth and heaven, then sing with the hidden and treasured melodies within thy spirit in these days wherein there hath befallen the Manifestation of God's Self what no eyes of creation have ever witnessed. O Beauty of Holiness! The command is in Thy hands, and I am but Thy humble servant, abased before Thee and ruled by Thy command. When Thou commandest me to make mention in remembrance of God, the Most Great, and God's Greatest Treasure, it behooveth Thee to command the angels of Paradise to guard the pillars of the Throne, then the angels on high to preserve the pavilions of grandeur, lest the veil of the Divine Realm be rent asunder by this Call which hath been concealed in the breast of glory. O Glory of the Spirit! Veil not Thyself with these veils, but appear through God's power, then break the seal from the vessels of the Spirit which have been sealed from all eternity with the seal of preservation, that the fragrant breezes may waft from this Ancient Vessel upon all created things, perchance all existence may be quickened by the breath of the All-Merciful and arise to promote the Cause on the Day whereon the Spirit shall be witnessed from the direction of dawn. Say: This Tablet commandeth you to patience in this greatest terror and ordaineth steadfastness for you in this most mighty anguish, at the time when the Dove of Hijaz shall wing its flight from the precincts of Iraq, and the breezes of separation shall blow upon all contingent things, and the crimson hue shall appear in the face of heaven, and thus was the matter decreed in the Mother Book. Say: The Bird of Immortality hath taken flight from the horizon of the invisible realm and seeketh the heaven of the spirit in the holy Sinai, that the decrees of destiny might be reflected in the mirror of divine determination, and this is one of the hidden mysteries. Say: The Bird of Glory hath flown from one branch and seeketh the holy Branch that was planted in the land of exile. Say: The breeze of divine unity hath wafted from the City of Peace and seeketh to blow upon the City of Separation that was mentioned in the scrolls of the Command. Say: O concourse of the heavens and earth! Cast ye ashes upon your faces and heads, for Beauty hath vanished from the cities of nearness and seeketh to rise from the horizon of a distant heaven. All this hath been ordained in truth, and we thank God for this and for what He hath sent down upon us of tribulation after tribulation, and hath rained down upon us from the clouds of destiny showers of recognized sorrow.\n\nO Essence of Grief! End thy words in this remembrance, for by it We have grieved and the dwellers of the Supreme Concourse have grieved. Then make mention of 'Abdu'llah who asked about a message that was in truth momentous. Say: By God, the Truth! The Message hath been fulfilled in the Beauty of 'Ali, made manifest. Then the servants differed concerning it, and the divines of the age objected to it - they who were veiled by the veils of self. And ye have recognized the Beauty of God in the vesture of 'Ali, the Self-Subsisting, and soon will all who are in the heavens and earth recognize Him. This hath been inscribed in truth and was decreed by God as inevitable. And ye shall learn of a message at a time which must surely come.\n\nBut, O people of the Bayan! Strive within yourselves lest ye differ regarding the Cause of God. Be steadfast in the Cause like unto a mountain firmly fixed in truth, that neither the whisperings of Satan may cause you to slip, nor anything on earth make you waver. This is what the Dove of the Cause counseleth you at the time of parting from the land of Iraq, through that which the hands of the polytheists have wrought.\n\nKnow then, O company of the chosen ones, that when the Sun setteth, the birds of night move about in darkness. Therefore, turn not unto them, but set your faces toward a holy and beloved direction. Beware lest ye follow the Samiri within yourselves, nor pursue the calf when it appeareth among you. This is the best counsel from Me unto you and unto all creation collectively.\n\nYe shall hear the call of the Samiri after Me, and he shall summon you unto Satan. Turn not then unto him, but turn unto a Beauty mighty yet concealed. Thus do We address all who are in the heavens and on earth in this City, that all things may receive what hath been ordained for them by One All-Wise, All-Knowing.\n\nAnd thou, O Time, be not heedless of this moment which hath come in truth, wherein the breath of God wafteth from a holy western direction. And thou, O Hour, rejoice in this Hour which hath arisen in truth. Then recognize in this eternal, enduring, celestial Table that which hath descended from the cloud of holiness and the shadows of light from the heaven of glory in the name of God.\n\nO Day! Illumine all created things with this Divine, radiant, resplendent Day which hath appeared from the horizon of Iraq unto all regions and been witnessed. Thus do We expound unto you the verses and cast upon you the words of the Spirit, and bestow upon all things that which hath been decreed in a mighty Book inscribed, that all things may know the Fountainhead of Oneness in this Ridvan which hath in truth been outpoured. And the Spirit be upon you and upon those who have circled round the Cause and who have walked in the path of love.\n\n=== END BH00034 ===\n\n=== START BH00035 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Generous, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nPraise befitteth and beseemeth that Beloved One Who, with the finger of power, rent asunder the most mighty and glorious veils and guided the people of Baha to the highest horizon. He is the Expositor at Whose utterance all exposition is thunderstruck, and He is the Judge at Whose justice the Balance itself trembleth. Through but a single manifestation of His Will, the books of the world appear and become manifest, and through but a drop from the ocean of His Purpose, creation is thrown into commotion and tumult. Glory be to God! What manner of fire is this that maketh fresh and enduring, and what manner of water is this that increaseth heat? From the wine of His knowledge every possessor of understanding loseth his understanding, and from the Kawthar of His utterance every one devoid of hearing is endowed with hearing and proclaimeth His call. He bestoweth sight and declareth \"Look and thou shalt see Me.\" Glory be to God! A Day of such blessedness and such sanctity hath remained unappreciated, and the pearls of the ocean of inner meanings have fallen into the hands of the sightless. The lowliest of all the parties of the earth regard themselves as the most exalted of creation, and souls that are but illusions count themselves among those possessed of certitude. Every fair-minded one is bewildered and every possessor of wisdom is confounded. The intoxication of vain desire hath prevented all from recognizing and comprehending the Day of God. This evanescent soul beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid all to achieve that which beseemeth them.\n\nI pray, send greetings and glorification upon those whom the veils have not prevented from the Dawning-Place of verses, who have arisen to promote the Cause and have spoken that which they were bidden in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. They are those who have testified to that which God hath testified and have acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged. These are servants unto whom the Supreme Pen hath borne witness, attesting to their devotion, their humility, their lowliness, and their arising to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the signs of Thy grandeur to assist them in all conditions to remember and praise Thee, and to enable them to that which befitteth Thy dawning and Thy manifestation and Thy power. O my Lord! Thou seest them before Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world, by the Most Great Name, to preserve them from whatsoever is unworthy of Thy days. Then manifest through them that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted in Thy dominion. Thou art the Almighty Whom the affairs of creation cannot frustrate nor the manifestations of the earth weaken. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Although this servant beseecheth and imploreth the True One, exalted and mighty be He, to be enabled to respond to thy letters, there have nonetheless been occasional delays. However, these delays have been caused by the press of occupations, to which thou thyself hast borne and continuest to bear witness. Praise be to God! Though there have been delays, they have not been forgotten and in every case a response hath been offered. This letter fulfilleth the promise made on the ninth of Rabi'u'th-Thani that the remainder of the response to thy letter dated the first of Safar would be submitted and dispatched.\n\nRegarding what you wrote that one of the handmaidens of God named Fatimah is adorned with the ornament of divine love, and that her son took his own life by poison - this matter was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed in response: \"O 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! We found not from him the fragrance of certitude, yet We forgave him as a bounty to you and to his mother. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We mention her at this time to give her glad tidings of the verses of her Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O Fatimah! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord. He mentions thee from the prison and calls thee to God, the Lord of Lords. Be not grieved by what has transpired. Children are for the perpetuation of name and remembrance, and this only if God confirms and the child is adorned with justice. Now you have attained to that which is a hundred thousand times more excellent. Ask God to keep you firm and steadfast in His love, and that the Supreme Pen may reveal the word of His good-pleasure concerning you. This is a bounty whose mention and honor shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Hold fast to the hem of the mercy of thy Lord, the Generous. O 'Ali! Give her the glad tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy, and that which hath been revealed for her from the heaven of My Will and surged in the ocean of My utterance, the Mighty, the Impregnable. God willing, may all be quickened by the fire of divine favor and the water of the All-Merciful's mercy, in such wise that the coldness of the world may not chill the people of Baha nor hold them back from the Most Exalted Horizon.\" \\[...\\]\n\nO my handmaid! God willing, mayest thou be the recipient of divine favors. This is the Day wherein the gems of human existence must be made manifest through the divine Name. The path hath been laid and the balance set up. Beseech ye the exalted Lord that He may aid all His servants and handmaidens to achieve that which beseemeth His days. This is the Day of goodly deeds and spiritual attributes. Strive thou to attain that which God hath purposed. Thou hast been remembered before His presence, and God willing, shall continue to be remembered. Rejoice thou in thy Lord's bounty and render thanks unto Him through His beauteous remembrance. Blessed is thy father. The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified on his behalf in such wise that his remembrance shall endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. He attained the presence of God once in Baghdad and again in this mighty prison. He approached with radiant countenance by his Lord's leave until he entered and presented himself at the gate, and heard the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds. On most days he attained Our presence and heard that which the Beloved heard on His night journey and Moses heard on the Mount of knowledge. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken, yet the people are for the most part heedless.\n\nO handmaid of God! Great indeed is God's favor and mighty is His grace. The entire world standeth powerless to reckon the measure thereof. He hath forgiven thee out of His grace and commandeth thee to that which beseemeth thee. He is verily the All-Bountiful and His Essence dominateth the worlds. God willing, may the handmaids of the All-Merciful act in a manner befitting their station. This is the counsel of the Peerless Friend. The Glory be upon thee and upon them that follow guidance.\n\nConcerning thy mention of the friends in that land and the question about the blessed verse, it was presented before His presence. This is what the All-Bestowing hath revealed in response:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing Speaker\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the precincts of His hallowed House and His praiseworthy station, that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful. We have heard thy call and answered thee, and witnessing thy humility, We have remembered thee in such wise as to diffuse the fragrance of My loving-kindness amongst My servants. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. We make mention of My loved ones whom thou hast mentioned, that the call may attract them to the Supreme Horizon and draw them nigh unto a station wherein the hosts of the earth shall not frighten them, nor shall the derision of the infidels who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds, cause them to grieve. He verily protecteth them as He pleaseth through the sovereignty of might, majesty and power, and nothing whatsoever can frustrate His purpose. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Omnipotent. Say: Consider ye this world - it passeth away like a breath, quicker than the twinkling of an eye. Thus doth He Who possesseth a perspicuous Book remind you. Ponder ye upon it and its evanescence. By the life of God! Ye shall then find yourselves in supreme joy. Ye are they whom the All-Merciful remembereth throughout all possibility and to whom He maketh known His straight path. Ye have attained unto that which Moses attained aforetime. My tongue and My Pen and the denizens of My glorious kingdom bear witness unto this.\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Give them glad tidings from Me and proclaim unto them from My tongue. Then remind them of that which shall make them mighty in this Cause, that the spirit of steadfastness may descend upon them from the heaven of thy Lord's grace, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Most strange it is that souls who claim the station of steadfastness and certitude become agitated and shaken by the merest whiff from the embodiments of vain imaginings. The tales of old have held people back from steadfastness, and lack of understanding hath deprived them of this supreme bounty, heedless that whatsoever they have heard before was pure falsehood and sheer calumny. These matters were mentioned before in most eloquent terms. Thou must acquaint the souls with these things in such wise that the heedless ones shall find themselves powerless to prevent them, but rather shall perceive their own impotence and limitation.\n\nWhen they asked Ja'far, brother of 'Askari, whether any offspring remained from his brother, he said there was a child who died. When the false pretenders heard this statement, they denied it and called him a liar. Observe to what degree the oppression reached and to what level the calumny ascended. Then mention was made of the Holy Domain and the appearance of epistles, with all the details you have previously heard. May God grant justice regarding such souls who have left the helpless people wandering in the wilderness of doubts and idle fancies, and who have proven worse than Abu Lahab. Now for some time this title of \"liar\" will remain among the people of Pharaoh for that truthful Speaker. These false and lying pretenders cling to the same devices; their original way and path remains the same. The receptive souls must be made aware so that they may become informed and not be deprived of what God has intended through the whisperings of Satan's party. I swear by the brightness of the Sun of Justice that this Wronged One's purpose is that powerful souls should arise to promote the Cause and protect the people from the evil of satans, until they reach a station where they see themselves independent of all that has passed and count all save the Truth as non-existent and null. Say: O friends, fix your gaze upon the horizon of the Cause and upon that which hath appeared therefrom. This is the counsel of Truth. Convey My greetings to all the friends and remind them of that which the Book hath spoken. Those souls who are now in the land of Sad and elsewhere, calling people to hell - you yourself know that they were not and are not aware of any Cause. They speak according to their desires. Their origin is falsehood and unto falsehood do they return. Verily they are of falsehood and unto it shall they return. In any case, seize the reins of the Cause through God's power and might, and call the receptive ones to the horizon of certitude. Perchance they may drink from the Kawthar of assurance and manifest complete steadfastness.\n\nIndeed, this evanescent one is bewildered, nay, dumbfounded. By what proof can those who turn away from this Most Great Cause establish any other cause? Through a drop from this ocean all the Prophets and Messengers guided the people to the truth. Now the ocean is manifest, yet the people are observed to be veiled and heedless. The expounder must break all the idols of vain imaginings that people previously held, with the arm of certitude, and lead them to the Dawning-Place of verses with the rod of wisdom. The Command is in God's hands.\n\nRegarding what was written about Jinab-i-Aqa Khodadad, upon him be the glory of God, it was mentioned. The Sun of loving-kindness shone forth from the horizon of grace. They said: The children of the Friend and the heirs of the Interlocutor have in this Revelation attained to the most great favor. Their mention, their acceptance, and their service have been revealed and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in scriptures and tablets. Convey to him greetings from the True One and say: Through the favor of the Peerless Friend thou hast attained the Most Exalted Horizon and been adorned with the recognition of the Dawning-Place of verses and the Source of clear proofs. Ask God that he may attain this lofty and most exalted station with supreme steadfastness. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Soon shall the fruits of deeds become manifest. Verily He does not suffer the reward of the doers of good and the benevolent to be lost. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Akhavan and his family, upon them be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], from the heaven of grace a most holy and exalted Tablet was revealed and sent specifically for each one. God willing, their eyes shall be illumined thereby and their hearts attain supreme joy. Likewise, specifically for Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Ja'far a most holy Tablet was revealed and sent, that his eyes might be consoled and his heart rejoiced. Up to this point is the response to your letter which was previously submitted, some of which was presented and sent, and some of which was to be sent later. Now praise be to God that this evanescent servant was enabled to fulfill his promise, praise be to God in all conditions. And your other letter which you had sent to Ismu'llah M.H., upon him be Baha'u'llah, was presented before His presence. This is what the Kingdom of Utterance hath spoken: God willing, on this most mighty, most exalted, most holy day, may they succeed in that which is befitting and proper. Their mention hath been made in His presence and the gaze of His favor is directed towards them. With perfect wisdom and utterance they must strengthen the weak souls through the blessed, mighty Word of God and adorn them with the ornament of certitude, that they may remain protected from the doubts of the manifestations of fancy and idle imaginings. Indeed, may they behold each of the people of Baha in such a steadfast station that they find themselves incapable of speech. O 'Ali-Qabil-Akbar! All the people of the Bayan bear witness that on the day when all hid behind the veil of concealment from the might of the manifestations of tyranny, the Truth arose by His own Self to promote the Cause and with the most exalted call summoned the people of the kingdom of utterance to the supreme horizon and guided all to the stream of certitude. Verily thy Lord is the Helper, the Teacher, the All-Informed.\n\nYour supplication was presented repeatedly, and Jinab-i-Ismu'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah, acting as your representative, was also blessed with a special visitation. Happy are ye and he and I. As to your question regarding a man who claimed to a woman that \"you are my wife and we recited the verse of consent, and agreed upon a specified dowry according to the law of the Book,\" and neither party had anyone present whose permission was required, nor were there other witnesses, and now the woman denies it saying \"such a thing never occurred and it is a lie\" - what is the ruling and judgment? These matters were presented before His presence and He said: This marriage was not performed according to the law of the Book, for the marriage vows must be recited and a group must be present so that afterwards no one can deny it. The vows are not obligatory but witnesses are required. And after the House of Justice is established with its members, they will surely designate someone along with others specifically for this matter so that affairs may be conducted according to divine law. Even if something truly occurred between two people, since it was not done according to what God has decreed, it was and is not acceptable. For if it were done otherwise, it would cause chaos, corruption and contention. He hath appeared and made manifest His straight path so that every matter may be observed firmly in its proper place. They must repent and return unto God, the Forgiving, the Generous. Verily He forgiveth His servants and He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nEvery soul hath full authority over their own possessions and may do with them as they wish, so long as they are possessed of a sound mind. Their authority is not taken from them. This is what God hath decreed. However, after the onset of a true mental incapacity that is clearly established by skilled physicians, their authority ceaseth by the decree of the Book. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Praised.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Heydar, in that thou hast turned thy face towards God, hast believed in Him and hast migrated in His path despite what thou didst encounter from the hosts of the oppressors. Those souls who have not attained unto the recognition of God in this day are accounted as being in an embryonic state. Verily, one who hath attained is he who hath both recognized and conveyed My Cause. Observe those souls who count themselves among the people of certitude and assurance, and who consider themselves illumined by the light of the divine Sun of Manifestation and steadfast, yet at the time of testing they are found submerged in doubt by the words of deluded souls whose proofs are flimsier than a spider's web. How strange it is! What regret and remorse! Although all are aware that none had any knowledge of this Cause, and these disseminators speak merely of their own desires and have heard naught but from their like, yet they are found wavering and disturbed. The people of Baha must manifest such steadfastness and power that none shall find occasion for speech or denial. By the life of God! These people are in manifest loss.\n\nO Heydar! God willing, thou shalt remain protected from the arrows of the deniers and the objectors, and be adorned with the ornament of certitude. Consider the words of the Point of the Bayan regarding what the heedless souls today proclaim and cling to. He saith: \"The one-year-old babes of that Revelation are mightier than all the followers of the Bayan\" - that is, than those who cling to the Bayan. This statement of the Author of the Bayan, and other statements of its people, thou and the other friends have heard what they have said and continue to say. By the life of God! They are among the oppressors.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked regarding the embryo, know thou that whatsoever hath occurred and will occur in the world is according to divine wisdom, and all things are created complete and perfect, with effect and fruit. If one were to observe and contemplate any matter or thing before his eyes, he would testify with absolute certainty that His wisdom is consummate and His craftsmanship perfect. Consider the hand which is ever with man - all that it possesses is according to wisdom. If but one of its veins, which is the finest and most delicate of all, should be afflicted, the strength and movement of the hand would be impaired. Every sage hath testified to the perfection of His handiwork and every learned one to the completeness of His creation. And whatsoever hath been created must needs reach its state of perfection and attain unto maturity. And if it be prevented by other causes, this too is according to other divine wisdom, which in some cases is manifest and evident, and in others hidden and concealed. For example, God hath bestowed the hand, and for man it is necessary, as it is observed to be the greatest of instruments. However, when it is severed on account of theft, this deficiency is, in the eyes of the discerning, perfect, nay rather, most perfect, for it is the cause of protection and the means of preventing the servants from committing reprehensible and rejected deeds. Observe all things from this perspective. It is evident that the creation of the embryo is for the purpose of growth and maturity \\[...\\]\n\nVerily the mind is the greatest sign in man, and blessed is he who attaineth unto it. Yet notwithstanding its lofty station and exalted rank, it is seen to be powerless to comprehend most things, for the mind's knowledge dependeth upon the testimony of sight. Unless the eye beholdeth the palm tree, the mind cannot perceive in the date-stone its fruits and leaves, branches and boughs. How then could the mind, before seeing, comprehend that there existeth in the world something a particle of which could burn up the entire world, reduce it to ashes, and cause it to vanish? Assuredly the Hand of Divine Power hath brought such a thing to perfection. Neither are God's worlds limited to this world, nor is His power restricted from aught, nor His might confined to the means of this world. And since it hath been established and proven that His creation is perfect and complete, and that whatsoever hath been and is observed is in accordance with wisdom, it therefore becometh evident to every soul that whatsoever appeareth imperfect hath been ordained to attain unto perfection and completion, and shall be made manifest. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Creator, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nWere the Most Exalted Pen to fully reveal the mysteries of this station, ye would behold the hidden secrets in the outward appearance of all things. God willing, may this station be unveiled, and may ye drink from the ocean of joy and knowledge. O Haydar! Hearken unto the voice of Him Who hath been wronged, and stand firm in the Cause of God with such steadfastness that neither sitting nor standing can match or attain unto it. That which is needed today is to aid the Cause of God through wisdom and utterance. Be seated and take counsel regarding the conduct of affairs, and with perfect calm and dignity carry out whatsoever will conduce to the exaltation and advancement of the Cause of God.\n\nAs to the embryos of the Bayan, it must be observed that even after a hundred thousand years it is not known whether they will attain unto the stage of maturity. Consider the words of their chief, how he regardeth the people as utterly foolish when he writeth that they take two verses from the Qur'an and two verses from the Bayan, combine them and call it a verse. Now ponder the falsehood of that heedless soul, and at what station and rank he standeth. Should anyone reflect upon his words, he would gain complete knowledge of his true condition. Although in this Revelation there hath appeared that which hath never appeared in any age - if they look to the abundance of verses, verily they have filled the East and the West. In the Tablet of Burhan this blessed verse was sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will. Thus speaketh He, exalted be His glory: \"Dost thou object to Him Who hath brought unto thee that which thou possessest and that which the people of the world possess of the proofs of God and His signs?\" And in another place: \"Dost thou deny the verses of thy Lord which, when sent down from the heaven of His Cause, caused all the Books of the world to bow down before them?\" Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance, yet most of the people are heedless. And if they look to the sweetness and greatness of the verses, all atoms bear witness that they cannot be compared to even a single tablet from among the wondrous and exalted divine tablets - whatsoever is in the Bayan \\[...\\]\n\nIn all their grandeur the verses are observed, and all atoms bear witness that whatsoever was revealed in the Bayan and before it cannot equal a single Tablet from among the wondrous and exalted divine Tablets. The Point of the Bayan--may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake--hath said: \"A single letter thereof transcendeth all that hath been revealed in the Bayan.\" Where is he that heareth and seeth? Where is he that showeth justice and speaketh the truth? This evanescent servant beseecheth God to vouchsafe unto the heedless and the wayward a drop from the ocean of fairness. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nConcerning what thou didst mention about the dream of Aqa 'Abdu'l-Karim from the people of ?ad, this is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: We caused him to hear the Word of Truth and showed him what was hidden. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God hath ordained what he witnessed and saw, and he shall soon behold it. Verily he is in the All-Glorious Horizon, the Most Exalted Horizon, and he giveth glad tidings unto all of this News whereby the Book of existence hath been adorned and every wise matter made manifest. Assuredly, that which he saw shall come to pass in due time. Thus hath the All-Wise decreed in His perspicuous Book.\n\nThis year certain upheavals have occurred in those blessed lands. Among them, in Najaf the plague appeared with such intensity that the residents were forcefully expelled and given lodging elsewhere. It is evident what hath occurred and come to pass in that city. Great changes have appeared. The servant doth not wish to mention all that hath transpired therein. This much he mentioneth: all these matters have been and are preparations for the fulfillment of that true dream. Glory be unto him who hath heard what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about 'Ali Khan and Ustad 'Abbas, it was submitted, and two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent specifically for them. He said: The rain of mercy descendeth at all times from the heaven of grace; if the place be ready and worthy of the appearance of grace, deliver the Tablets that they may attain unto them.\n\nThus far is the answer to thy letter which thou didst write on the 12th of ?afar and send through Ismu'llah.\n\nAs for thy last letter dated the 16th of Rabi'u'th-Thani, in truth it was a bird that taught this evanescent bird to warble--that is, from thy mention it learned to mention the Beloved of the world. Well is it with the people of wisdom who have been intoxicated by the choice wine of utterance. After its recitation and reading it attained the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and thy supplication was offered before the face of the Desired One time and again. Thou hast been mentioned by thy Lord and my Lord and the Lord of the heavens and the earth. He--exalted be His glory--hath said:\n\nIn My Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible\\[...\\]\n\nThe servant present has appeared with thy letter and hath laid before Us what was inscribed therein of thy words, from which We perceived the fragrance of thy sincerity, thy remembrance and thy praise. Verily thy Lord is the Hearing, the Answering. By My life, thou hast spoken the truth, and the Mother Book beareth witness to this, as it sitteth established upon the throne of utterance in this exalted station. Say: By God! The Lord of the Messengers hath come, the Sovereign Book hath been sent down, and the Ocean of Life circleth round the will of our Lord, the Most Merciful, Who hath appeared and revealed what He desired through His Great Name. Whosoever hath hesitated in this Cause for less than a moment hath been cursed by every letter in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Bring forth what ye possess and We shall lay before you what We possess. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the One Who distinguisheth, separateth, explaineth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By God! The Balance proclaimeth, the Path calleth out, and the Trumpet declareth: Open your eyes! This is He Who was mentioned in God's Books, and He is the One Who spoke on Sinai. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and be not among the losers. The Hidden Treasure hath appeared and the Spirit before His Face proclaimeth, saying: This is He Whom God's Messengers foretold, were ye of them that know.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Reflect upon God, His proof, His testimony, His sovereignty, and that which the tongues of the heedless have uttered - they who have turned away from My straight Path. Say: This is a Day wherein naught is mentioned save God, if ye be of the fair-minded. Say: This is a Day wherein the Face hath appeared after the destruction of all things and the extinction of all names, if ye be of them that hear.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Consider the station whereof the Primal Point hath spoken: \"I seek refuge with Thee, O my God, lest my position on that Day be the position of the wicked.\" Observe what He said and what they say, what He did and what they do. They arose to cut down the Tree, and when their schemes were exposed, they opened their lips in calumny. You and all the people of the Bayan know that the Truth hath never been hidden nor concealed behind a veil. He hath been manifest and evident among the people, time and again He hath gone into exile, and repeatedly hath He been cast into prison with chains and fetters. With utmost power and might He summoned all on earth to the Truth, and in those days no one appeared. Yet that wrongful soul represented himself as wronged and attributed injustice to the Truth, exalted be His glory. No one asked him what wrong had been done to him, what hardship he had endured, or what tribulation he had suffered. All know that in every city where he dwelt, he lived in seclusion with a group of women in perfect ease. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Merely upon hearing that someone had been arrested in the land of Ta or elsewhere, he would leave Iraq and wander about in Basra, Samavah and around Baghdad, returning only after hearing that safety was restored. And to every city where the Ancient Beauty would go, he would arrive afterwards. The only thing that befell him was that he was sent to Cyprus, and this too happened indirectly, for the intention was to imprison the Ancient Beauty, and to fulfill what had been previously said concerning the mention of the island \\[...\\]\n\nAnd to establish what was said before regarding the island - and you and all know that no one but this servant was or is aware of its circumstances. Indeed these few words that were submitted were out of heedlessness, for man in his heedlessness from the Truth occupies himself with such words. But the Exalted Truth is aware. The purpose is that perhaps some souls may observe and become aware. These matters have been mentioned repeatedly. Verily He guides whom He willeth unto His straight path. In any case, today all the people of the Bayan are seen to be in the fire except for the souls that are assured and tranquil. This note that hath appeared from the Divine Trump must be heeded. His word, exalted be His mention: \"It is permitted unto Him Whom God shall make manifest to reject anyone on earth above whom there is none higher, for this is created within His grasp and all are submissive unto Him.\" These statements are for the weak among creation, otherwise this Most Great Revelation hath never been and is not in need of anything else to establish its Cause. One day this word shone forth from the Dayspring of Will - He said that no one before hath known this Most Great Revelation as it truly is. This eternal treasure hath been concealed from the understanding and minds of all else, and this is specific to this Revelation. And this is a word to which the divine Books, Psalms and Scriptures of the past and future have testified. By God's life, this is a mighty Cause and a momentous announcement.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about Aqa Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon them be the Glory of God - indeed it is as you mentioned. Praise be to God, they have attained the utmost heights and the highest horizon. In these days when the limbs of existence are seen to tremble from the oppression of the aggressors and tyrants, God willing through the effects of their steadfastness all shall attain the greatest steadfastness. And you must educate souls to this station until they attain a state where they see all who are on earth as utter nothingness before a single word of God's words. Their petitions reached the Most Holy Court and their supplications were presented before His presence. The Sun of favor hath risen from the horizon of grace and two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent from the heaven of Will. God willing, may they at all times drink from the living waters of the verses of the All-Merciful and occupy themselves with teaching the Cause with wisdom. This servant also intended to submit something to Aqa Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, but since the most great verses were revealed from the Supreme Pen, this servant did not trouble further. However their mention shall never, God willing, be erased from the heart. And the matters they had written were presented in the Most Holy Court, including the question about using certain drinks and essences. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in this regard: \"He is permitted to use whatever he desireth for illness.\" Previously in such cases this word was heard from the Ancient Tongue, exalted be His grandeur: \"Whatever a skilled physician prescribeth, there hath been and is no objection to following it. Blessed is he who hath adhered to the knowledge which God hath honored and preferred above all other knowledge.\" God willing may they be enabled to cure the chronic diseases of the nations with the antidote of the Most Great Name, that all may be adorned with the ornament of health and turn to the station of sanctification and detachment.\n\nAnd as to what you wrote concerning the aforementioned person who submitted a petition which, due to certain of his thoughts, was not forwarded - excellent was your action. Such souls appear heedless of the Cause of God. In former years someone submitted a petition containing certain statements, and it was said: \"This is not the day of test and trial. It is not for creation to test God, glorified be His majesty; rather, He tests His servants.\" Say: \"Read ye the Books of God that were sent down aforetime, that ye may discover that which befitteth this Day, the Day through whose mention the Scriptures of God, the Lord of all worlds, have been adorned.\" And in a Tablet to one of the friends who dwelt near the Prison Land, this blessed verse was revealed from the heaven of God's Will: \"This is not the day for questions. It behooveth every soul, when he heareth the Call, to turn to the Most Sublime Horizon and say: 'Here am I, here am I, O God of the worlds! Here am I, here am I, O Thou Goal of all who seek Thee!'\"\n\nAs to what you wrote regarding those souls who have ascended unto God - verses adorned with the word 'forgiveness' were specifically revealed for them from the heaven of the mercy of the All-Merciful and were previously sent. By the life of the Beloved! The breathings of the verses so encompassed them that those who count are powerless to reckon them.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, who was among the emigrants to the Land of ?ad, and his son Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Muhammad - some time ago one of the partakers of the wine of inner meanings, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote to this servant mentioning that certain objectors from among the Bayanis, that is, from the party of Satan, had met with Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Muhammad in the Land of ?ad and had raised certain doubts. This matter caused this servant great astonishment, for the people of God must be so firm and steadfast that neither the winds of the world nor the whisperings of the nations can move them. Through their steadfastness, hearts and minds should be illumined with the light of constancy, and through their firmness and rootedness the banner of divine unity should be raised upon the highest standards. Those who cast doubts have no understanding whatsoever of this Cause, for in the beginning no one was aware of its essence. Whosoever claims such awareness utters pure falsehood and manifest lies. In any case, this evanescent servant beseeches God that the reward of His loved ones not be lost through the sayings of this one and that one, and that all may be adorned with the ornament of steadfastness.\n\nHis honor Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, and those with him, have ever been remembered in the Most Holy Court, and the glances of favor have been directed towards them. In all instances of hardship and tribulation, the hand of divine power has preserved them. This is a day wherein the suns of steadfastness must be seen dawning and shining forth from the horizons of the hearts of the people of the Crimson Ark. God willing, it is hoped that they - that is, his honor Aqa Siyyid Muhammad - may remain protected from the arrows of the allusions of the opposers and the spears of the doubts of the deniers, and may speak that by which hearts and minds are attracted. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to them. God willing, may they arise with that which befitteth the Days of God. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the All-Knowing Witness. In all conditions, I beseech and hope from the True One, exalted be His glory, their good, health and protection. The Command is in the hands of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Would that this servant could meet with the friends and present certain hidden matters. In all conditions the servant sayeth and testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the Command in the beginning and in the end, and He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is knowing of all things. And concerning what you wrote about his honor Mulla Mahdi from the people of Jasb, it was presented before the Throne. This is what the Kingdom of Utterance hath spoken: He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nO Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Drink thou of the Most Pure Kawthar from the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily, He will show thee that which is hidden from the eyes of men. We have made mention of thee in the Book of My servant who is present, time and again, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Seeing Speaker. There hath been mentioned in Our presence he who is named Mahdi, who hath believed in God, the Lord of lords. Say: Grieve not, for We have mentioned thee before, to this My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness with the most excellent utterance. We had previously revealed and sent forth the Most Great, Most Holy Tablet especially for him, that he might inhale from it the fragrance of the All-Merciful and attain unto the most exalted station, which is the station of steadfastness. At this hour, too, We have mentioned him in these sublime and glorious verses, and beyond these two, another Tablet hath been sent down for him from the heaven of My Will. Deliver it unto him, that his eyes may be cheered and his heart illumined with the lights of certitude.\n\nAs to the offering they have made, it hath been accepted, and as commanded, your honor should receive it and, with wisdom, offer hospitality to the friends of God. Gatherings are in no wise permitted. If several separate meetings be held, this would be more agreeable. When the Most Great Luminary was rising from the horizon of the Land of Mystery, this servant was commanded to write to him who was named Mahdi, whom God caused to dwell in His house after his migration, saying that ye should follow in the footsteps of the Lord of all beings, and associate with the people of the world in the utmost spirit of joy and fragrance, lest alarm and anxiety be aroused among the people and become a cause of disturbance to weak souls. In all circumstances, ye must observe wisdom and act in accordance with what ye have been commanded in the Book.\n\nThis servant conveyed these exalted words to them as directed. In response, they wrote that absolutely nothing contrary would appear, and that all the friends were gathering together in perfect love, kindness, and harmony, occupied in the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds. After this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court, this word was issued from the Source of Command - exalted be His glory: Write that the government has had and will have no concern with your inner beliefs and religion, whether you deny religions or recite the Quran. The government has no objection, but gatherings cause commotion and are contrary to the government's wishes, for from the beginning, governments have neither been aware of this Cause nor are they now, and throughout history they have witnessed corruption arise from gatherings. Therefore, they view these gatherings as they do other gatherings, and this very gathering and assembly is considered by governments a great offense and grievous error.\n\nThis evanescent one's petition is that mention be made to the honored ones and beloved ones in that land, from this servant who is utter nothingness and complete extinction, that all depends upon His Holiness's favor. God willing, it is hoped that all may shine forth like unto the sun from the horizons of the heavens of steadfastness. This servant beseecheth his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, to aid all to make good what hath escaped them in the days of their Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Praise be to God, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great.\n\nAnd as to what you wrote concerning Aqa Muhammad and Aqa 'Ali-Asghar, upon them be the Glory of God, it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. He said: \"O 'Ali! The horizons have been filled with the signs of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and the clear proofs have appeared from all directions through that which the Speaker of the Mount hath uttered in this Revelation, to which all atoms bear witness that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Great.\" Ask thou of God that the servants may be enabled to grasp the Tablet of the Lord of Days with utmost power and strength, that the intimations of the opposers and the doubts of the deniers may be erased from the page of the world. The True One hath been and ever shall be the Bestower of Grace, mentioning His servants, living or dead, and shall continue to do so. God willing, may hearts be prepared to receive the verses and ears be enabled to hearken unto them - that is, the true capacity to receive and the true hearkening. For if one attaineth unto this station, he shall be preserved from intimations, suggestions, doubts, veils and barriers. A most wondrous and exalted Tablet hath been revealed specifically for these two souls. God willing, may they drink from the living waters from the Wellspring of revealed verses and attain unto everlasting life.\n\nThe Sun of loving-kindness hath dawned especially for them from the horizon of grace and bounty, and is manifest and evident. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to enable them to grasp the Tablet through a power from Him and a strength from His presence. The intention of power and strength hath been and is certitude and assurance in all degrees. These words are thus interpreted lest anyone misconstrue what God hath intended and arise to create mischief. Whatever is mentioned regarding victory, assistance, service and the like, the purpose is to teach the Cause with joy and fragrance. The Command is in God's hand, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The heedlessness of the opposers among the people of the Bayan hath reached such a point that they have carved an idol with their own hands and accept whatever it uttereth, be it moist or dry. Thus that person who claimeth to be a Mirror - by God, even stone would be ashamed of him - interfereth with and betrayeth the sanctity of his own object of devotion who is the Sun, while those dead souls of Nimrod-like nature say that whenever the Prophet looked upon any woman she would become forbidden to her husband. They have not even enough understanding to realize who the Prophet was. If prophethood is truly established, it is the Person of the Point Himself, while those lying souls have desired to establish the station of successorship for their own purposes. How could a successor have authority over the Prophet's sanctuary? If he is a Mirror, how could he interfere with the sanctuary of the Sun? The Primal Point was not like ordinary people that what was lawful for Him should be unlawful for the Point. By Him Who raised up the heavens without pillars, from such utterances there wafteth a most foul and offensive odor. Fie upon them and upon their sense of shame and loyalty! What then is treachery and what is faithlessness? Glory be to God! They claim to be Mirrors yet interfere with the sanctuary of the Sun. God protect us and you from such reprehensible deeds which have caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament. Their words belie them and their deeds disavow them. Again, God protect us and you, O concourse of the fair-minded! A certain person in Iraq, Mirza Muhammad-'Ali-i-Rashti, heard this matter \\[...\\]\n\nGod deliver us and you, O concourse of the fair-minded! In Iraq, Mirza Muhammad-'Ali-i-Rashti heard of this incident and would mockingly deride and reproach the perpetrators with various expressions in every gathering. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! Similarly, the Dayspring of existence, the Most Exalted Matron, the mother of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - was in Najaf, and since she had some hesitation regarding the Cause of the Exalted One, certain individuals were commanded to explain the details of the Revelation to her. After the mention and explanations were made in her presence, she finally declared: \"How could these souls who acknowledge and confess His Qa'imiyyat violate His sanctuary?\" What profound shame was felt at these words! By Him Who caused the pebble to speak forth in demonstration of His power, for a time the Ancient Beauty was grieved by these words and declared that speech was no longer permissible. From the beginning of creation until now, such an act has never been heard of. In truth, such wicked, atheistic, lying souls are most fitting to be the leaders of these people. In any case, this servant is ashamed to mention certain of his deeds. Abu'l-Qasim from K., who had been with him in the early years, issued a death sentence against him based on the slightest suspicion that had no foundation whatsoever. And likewise other souls - if the details were to be presented it would cause weariness. You have heard the details about the third letter, the believer in Him Whom God shall make manifest - upon him be all His most glorious glory. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to protect these servants and deliver the heedless. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nYou wrote that at the time of writing, the beloved and revered Ism'ullah Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, was present. This news brought great joy and delight. God willing, may he ever be adorned with the ornament of health and well-being, and be engaged in the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. Mention of him was made in the presence of the Divine Throne, and He said: \"Convey Our greetings to him, that such greetings may renew the days of attainment and their remembrance.\" And say: \"O My Name! Reflect upon the tales of old and carefully observe the conjectures and imaginings they have devised. Even now the heedless persist in such fancies. For twelve hundred years, their gaze was fixed upon the imaginary Jabulqa and the illusory Jabulsa, and these vain imaginings inflicted such harm upon the Manifestation of the Cause that its reckoning transcends human capacity. By these same imaginings did they martyr the Point, and this Prisoner is passed from land to land at the hands of the wicked. O My Name! Strive with utmost endeavor that perchance the helpless servants may not once again remain wandering in the darkness of idle fancies. He who was and is incapable of standing in the presence hath spread the carpet of vain imaginings more widely than before, and the worshippers of idols seek to execute that which is greater than what came before. Take hold of the reins of the Cause by thy Lord's leave, then speak that whereby the hearts of the mystics may soar and the feet of the perturbed may be made firm.\" Say: \"O servants! Come, let us act according to a true word which all are bound to obey: let us set aside all that we have heard and purify our ears of all that they have listened to, and then turn to the sacred verses. By God's life! They verily guide all to the supreme horizon and speak with most eloquent utterance among all peoples, saying: 'I am verily the Mother Book, before and after. When My fragrance is diffused, all the books of the world bow down before Me, and God's straight path is made manifest.' Blessed is he who hath found My fragrance and turned to My face, and woe betide every denier who hath turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds.\" O My Name! I shall complain to thee once again concerning all the mirrors. I swear by the Sun of Truth which riseth and shineth from the horizon of the prison that had any soul arisen to champion the Cause and been capable of its exaltation, this Prisoner would never have consented to be made manifest. This matter was the cause of arising, as were the lamentations of the Point. Reflect upon that which the Wronged One hath uttered, before and after, and in this mighty prison.\n\nI request that you convey, on behalf of this evanescent non-entity, expressions of evanescence and nothingness to His Holiness, and if Jinab-i-Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God, is also present, convey greetings to him and mention that you should strive to quicken the dead through the outpourings of the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance. All success lies in this. God willing, may they be assisted in achieving that which is beloved in God's sight. If all the friends and loved ones of God had occupied themselves with teaching the Cause, most assuredly the majority of those lands would have been observed cleansed and purified from the defilement of polytheism and heedlessness, and all would have been freed and liberated from all hardships and troubles. It is hoped that God will assist all and aid them in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. Verily, He is the Near, the Answerer.\n\nRegarding Jinab-i-Aqa Hasan-'Ali, one of the emigrants to the Land of Sad, upon him and upon them be the Glory of God, which you had mentioned - this was presented at the Most Holy Court. A most mighty Tablet was revealed specifically for him and was dispatched. God willing, he will attain unto it. This evanescent servant also offers greetings. Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you, and upon those who have emigrated for the sake of God, and upon those who have answered His call, and upon those who have spoken in His praise and glorification, and upon those who have arisen to serve Him, and upon those who have not exchanged the wine of His love, and upon those who have drunk from the Kawthar of steadfastness once in His Name and again in His All-Wise remembrance. And praise be to God, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nThe Servant\n\n17 Rajab 1298\n\n=== END BH00035 ===\n\n=== START BH00036 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise sanctified above word and utterance beseemeth the peerless King Who hath caused all the Books and Scriptures and Tablets of the world to be adorned with His Name and to voice His praise, and Who hath enjoined upon all to observe this most perfect, most comprehensive, most mighty divine Word which hath dawned from the horizon of the Supreme Pen: \"Soon will He be made manifest whom no allusion in all the Books can indicate.\" To this beareth witness that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Bayan, saying: \"Verily, I have written a gem concerning His remembrance, and it is that He cannot be alluded to by My allusion, nor by what hath been mentioned in the Bayan.\" Is there any that hath an ear to hear what the Nightingale uttereth upon the branches? Is there any possessed of vision who can behold Him through the eyes of the All-Merciful? Every Prophet and every Messenger hath given tidings of this Most Great Revelation, declaring that He cannot be known through aught else besides Him nor through the eyes of His creatures. This blessed Word hath been specifically reserved in all the divine Books for this Revelation. However, the ears of men have been prevented from hearkening to the call of the All-Merciful by the allusions of the followers of the Qur'an and the doubts of the people of the Bayan, and their eyes have been debarred from beholding the lights of the Sun of inner meanings by the ophthalmia of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Is there any swimmer who can swim in this Ocean without allusion? Is there any seeker who can turn towards the Countenance without direction? Where are the horsemen of the arena of wisdom and utterance whom the veils of the people of creation have not hindered from turning towards God, the Lord of religions? Is there any endowed with the sense of smell who can detect the fragrance of the Garment in the days of God, detached from all else save Him? Is there any possessed of steadfastness who can arise and proclaim that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an and that which the Summoner hath cried out in the kingdom of the Bayan: \"The sovereignty on that Day belongeth unto God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Gracious\"? He is the One manifest and He is the One speaking in such wise that neither the allusions nor the veils of the people of controversy and majesty could debar Him from His purpose. He hath, with His most exalted call, summoned the people of the kingdom of creation to the most sublime horizon, in such manner that no fair-minded soul hath any way to deny or object. He it is through Whose name the standards have been planted and the banners raised. Blessed is the one whom the buzzing of the fly hath not kept back from the Lord of Lords. He hath arisen to serve his Lord and hath testified to that which God hath testified and acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged. He is indeed among the most exalted of beings in the sight of the Truth. Upon him shall pray every discerning mystic and every well-informed sage.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Thou hearest the sighing of Thy chosen ones in their separation from Thee, and the lamentation of Thy loved ones and the burning of their hearts in Thy days. O Lord! Write down for them, through the Pen of Thy bounty, the reward of meeting Thee, and for those who have drunk from the Kawthar of Thy presence. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, whereby the hearts of the nations were stirred, to enable the people of the Bayan to turn towards the horizon of Thy Revelation and to act according to what they have been commanded in Thy Book. O Lord! Thou seest them turning away from the direction of Thy grace and clinging to that which the people of the Furqan clung to in Thy days. Thou knowest, O my God, that they behold the verses yet deny them, and they utter that which was uttered by the people of hatred and contention at the appearance of the Dawning-places of Thy Revelation, the Manifestations of Thy Self, the Sources of Thy Cause, and the Day-springs of Thy knowledge. The verses have encompassed all directions, yet they turn away from them; the evidences have appeared like the sun at high noon, yet they perceive them not. O Lord! Enable them to break the idols of vain imaginings and to turn unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind. Thou art He Whom nothing frustrates and no affair prevents. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nSubsequently, thy letter sent from Beirut was received and caused joy. God willing, may all attain to the greatest joy - that is, to what is now manifest and evident from the horizon of the world. All divine Books speak of this most mighty, most holy, most wondrous Day, yet all are found to be veiled. How many trials did the Ancient Beauty endure so that some of the veils of contention and the clouds of glory might be rent asunder. Now it is observed that certain barking ones, corrupters and doubters are endeavoring to veil people even more than before. For one thousand two hundred and more years, the people of the Furqan, namely the Shi'ah sect, were uttering certain words and counting themselves the most exalted of creation and the saved and favored community. When the test appeared, they were seen to be the most wretched of all, to such extent that they martyred the Beloved of all possibility with the bullets of hatred and rancor in the land of Ta. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that the veiled ones among the people of the Bayan are now clinging to and uttering those same words, allusions, doubts, conjectures and vain imaginings. Say: O ye sightless ones! Reflect a little on what was the outcome of all those contentions and what was the fruit of those meaningless disputes. When this evanescent servant heard these decisive words from the mouth of the Will of the Lord of Names and Attributes, His words, exalted be His grandeur \\[...\\]\n\nThese ignorant ones have wished to veil the new creation as they veiled the Qur'an. O servant in attendance, convey the call of the Wronged One, that perchance those veiled by the Bayan may be granted a drop from the ocean of fairness. Say: This is the Day of God, wherein all that ye and all creation possess is not mentioned. Although at the time of the manifestation of the Daysprings of Oneness in the realm of creation, the term \"Day of God\" was applicable, yet this Most Great Revelation hath been singled out in all the Books as the appearance of the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Mystery. Blessed are they who perceive and blessed are they who know. This is that Day concerning which He saith: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds,\" and this is that Day concerning which He saith: \"The sovereignty on that Day is God's.\" The divine Books are replete with such references, yet they have freshly clung to mention of deputies, nobles, Imam, Caliph and the like. Say: Have not these mentions existed before? Bring forth their fruits and effects if ye be of them that are able. Say: Fear God, O people, and dispute not concerning God's verses, His grandeur, His sovereignty, His proof, His testimony and His evidences. Cast aside what ye possess through Our command and take what hath been sent down from this exalted and hallowed heaven. Say: Reflect upon the former religions. They hearkened unto words from various speakers and, through ignorant fanaticism, clung so tenaciously thereto that they would accept naught else and turned away from hearing aught else. O servant in attendance, speak for the sake of God that perchance they may turn unto God. Let them not say what was said before, nor do what the treacherous and heedless did before. Say: O people of the Bayan, hear the call of the faithful Counselor and hearken to the cry of the noble Adviser. These verses bear no resemblance to previous verses, and this Revelation is distinguished from all revelations. Hear for God's sake and judge with fairness for God's sake. None of you were or are aware of the source of this Cause's appearance. By Him Who hath caused all things to speak His praise, he by whom ye have been kept back from the straight path and debarred from the Speaking Mother Book was not and is not worthy of mention. Consider his writings in both Arabic and Persian, that ye may perchance find a way to the Truth. Hear the counsel of this Wronged One. Leave the croaking to the croakers and turn to the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree. Leave the pond of vain imaginings to the people of doubt and hasten to the Living Waters which today appear in the name of the All-Merciful. Pass beyond the realm of words and free yourselves from the field of traditions. This is not the day of Abahir and Khawafi. Soar with the wings of detachment that perchance ye may hear the rushing of the winds proclaiming \"There is none other God but Him.\" Turn away from streams and rivers, for lo, the Most Great Ocean is before your faces. Pass beyond the material world and its conditions which are the cause of malice, immorality, rancor and hatred, and take up your abode in the kingdom. O people of the Bayan, by the life of the All-Merciful, every letter of the Letters proclaimeth at the highest pitch: \"I am the Lord of the Bayan, could ye but hear.\" Behold with the eye of truth. By God's life, from every word the essence of meanings floweth. Say: This is the Day of hearing \\[...\\]\n\nO people of the Bayan! By the life of the All-Merciful! Every letter amongst the letters proclaims in its loudest voice: \"I am verily the master of utterance, could ye but hear it!\" Were ye to observe with the eye of truth, by God's life, from every word the essence of meanings flows forth. Say: This is the day of hearing and sight. See and hear! By God's life, that which passeth you by, ye shall never be able to recover or regain. Have mercy upon yourselves and upon God's servants, and be not the cause of waywardness and error. Leave behind what ye have heard and turn to the divine verses, that ye may understand and comprehend the power of Truth, the sovereignty of Truth, the loftiness of Truth, the exaltation of Truth, the knowledge of Truth, and the all-encompassing nature of Truth. Defile not this most subtle and pure air with your contaminated breaths, and veil not the lights of the divine morn with the clouds of idle fancies and vain imaginings. O people of the Bayan! The Kingdom of Utterance is stirred by the Word of the All-Merciful, while ye are gathered in the clay around earthworms, wasting your lives in idle talk and disputation. By God's life! Ye are seen to be deprived even of the mirage, let alone the ocean of inner meanings. O ye who are devoid of fairness! Turn with pure sight toward the Most Great Scene and speak with truthfulness. This is the day of revelation and witnessing, not the day of fancy and conjecture. I swear by the Most Great Name that the realm of meanings and utterance and the dwellers of Paradise lament and bewail because of your tyranny. Hearken unto My call and turn unto God, that He may forgive your evil deeds and draw you nigh unto the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nAlthough the utterances of the Lord of Names exceeded what hath been mentioned, this servant hath recorded that which was befitting to this station and expedient in these days, that perchance dead souls might be adorned with the vesture of life through the breaths of the All-Merciful utterance, and might be observed free and detached from imitation, limitation, fancy and idle imaginings. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path.\n\nConcerning what thou didst mention about Aqa Muhammad-Javad, father of him who beareth the name of Him Who is the Desired One, and his petition, and Aqa Muhammad-Hasan ('Ayn-?a), and likewise about Mulla Ibrahim, upon them be the glory of God - their supplications and petitions were presented at the Most Holy Court. Wondrous and exalted verses were specifically revealed for each one, and these were sent in the letter previously dispatched to thee. God willing, thou hast received it and hast caused the aforementioned souls to attain unto it. No response to that letter hath yet arrived; it was sent to the great city to be forwarded to thee.\n\nAt this moment, as bidden, I attained the Most Holy Presence, and He said: \"O servant present! It is Our wish to make mention of the loved ones of Ya and Alif and Ra, that perchance they may remain firm on the divine path and be preserved from the malodorous winds of the heedless souls.\" His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the One manifest from the horizon of the Prison \\[...\\]\n\nO My loved ones in Ya! The Wronged One remembereth you from the prison of 'Akka and enjoineth you to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the earth hath been cleft asunder and the mountains scattered. Beware lest the veils of glory withhold you from the station of nearness and holiness and beauty. Arise in the name of your Lord, the Possessor of Names, in such wise that the clamor of men shall not frighten you. He hath mentioned you before through that which illumined the horizon of proof, and remembereth you with verses at whose revelation necks were humbled. Look ye, then remember the bygone centuries and ages past, and that which befell the Daysprings of Revelation from those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest the doings of the ignorant shut you out from this Cause whereby every atom hath testified that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Prepare yourselves, O people, to hearken unto the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen, which was raised up in the prison by the command of your Lord, the Possessor of Names, whereby the Cock of the Throne crowed and the Dove of Knowledge cooed upon the branches. By God! This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone - to this testify the Books of God and that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Bayan. This is the Day of which We informed you aforetime when the Luminary of the Cause was shining from the horizon of Iraq. That which We promised you hath come to pass - verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Cast away, O people, what ye possess and take what hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Possessor of Religions. Thus hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof the Sun of your Lord's remembrance, the Revealer of verses. O people of Ya! Hearken with your inner ear to the call of the Wronged One of the horizons, that perchance the intimations of the godless and the doubts of the perverse may not deprive you from the Lord of the Manifest Day. This is the Lord of Days, around which all centuries and ages revolve. Know ye the value of this most mighty, most holy and blessed Day, and act in accordance with that which exalteth the Cause of God. Strive that ye be not seen as autumn leaves, which fall with but a single gust. Rather should ye be observed steadfast and firm as mountains in the path of God's love. Today the divine breezes are passing, and the Spirit of God proclaimeth \"Here am I\" in the wilderness of the Cause. Know your worth and recognize your station, and let not the deceptions and stratagems of the deceivers cause you to lose the straight path. Preserve the pearls of the All-Merciful's love in His Name within the treasuries of your hearts. This is the day of mention and praise, the day of deeds and detachment. Observe the leaves of the trees, how submissive and humble they appear when the winds blow. If the wind bloweth from the south, they incline thither, and likewise toward other directions. Man should not be seen as less than the leaves. God willing, all should manifest perfect submission and contentment when the winds of divine Will blow - that is, they should move by His will, speak by His leave, and act by His command. Beseech God to assist you in manifesting supreme steadfastness, such that ye may regard the voice of aught else but Truth as mere croaking and cawing.\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of the hidden and the manifest. He maketh mention of thee as a token of His grace. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nWe make mention of the loved ones in Elraf and give them glad-tidings of that which My Most Exalted Pen hath recorded in their remembrance in the prison of 'Akka. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nSay: We counsel you to be trustworthy and truthful, and to do that which will exalt the Cause of God above all else. Act ye accordingly and be not of the heedless. Beware lest the ornaments of the world debar you from the Lord of all beings. Abandon all that is therein, then turn with radiant faces unto the Most Sublime Horizon - the station wherein the Creator of the heavens proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nSay: This is the Day wherein all things have been attracted by the fragrance of the garment of your Lord, the Most Glorious, while ye remain fast asleep. Say: By God! The dwellers of the graves have arisen through the breezes of revelation, while ye remain still. The Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, while ye remain silent. Say: Every possessor of a heart hath turned toward the Ultimate Goal, while ye remain slumbering. Arise in My Name to serve My Cause and hold fast unto the cord of teaching. This is God's command, both aforetime and hereafter, did ye but know it.\n\nSay: O Thou at Whose separation the lamentation of them that are nigh unto Thee hath been raised, and the weeping of the sincere ones hath ascended! I beseech Thee by Thy Straight Path and by Thy Most Great Name, the Most Great, to confirm us in steadfastness in Thy Cause and to aid us in that which Thou lovest and approvest. O Lord! We are Thy servants and Thy bondsmen. I implore Thee by the breathings of Thy revelation in Thy days and the fragrance of Thy garment at the dawning of the lights of Thy countenance, to ordain for us through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall preserve us from the allusions of those who have disbelieved in Thy signs and turned away from Thy sovereignty, and from the doubts of every caviller who disputeth Thy signs and denieth Thy proof. Verily, Thou art He Whom the conditions of creation cannot frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and of the earth.\n\nO people of the divine realm! May ye, God willing, remain firm and steadfast. Ye have emerged from powerful, mighty, triumphant, transcendent and all-encompassing elements. Let not this most exalted and sublime station slip from your grasp. Hold fast unto the cord of power and cling to the hem of grace. Today the station of every possessor of being must needs become manifest and evident, for this is the day of the most great gathering and the most mighty resurrection. Every hidden thing shall come to light and every concealed thing shall become clear and manifest. This is the Day whereof the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in the Qur'an: \"O my son! If there be (anything) but the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.\" Strive ye, that there may be manifested from you goodly deeds, praiseworthy conduct, and complete steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of all creation. God willing, may ye be witnessed as so firm, steadfast and unwavering in the Cause of God that the entire world shall be powerless to hinder you and shall find itself utterly impotent. This is the counsel of the Wronged One and His testament. May ye, God willing, attain unto it and act accordingly, for this is the day for pure deeds performed for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Trustworthy.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Husayn - upon him be the Glory of God ninety-six. His petition reached the Most Holy Court some time ago, and he likewise addressed a letter to this evanescent servant. God willing, may he ever be and continue to be engaged in service to the Cause. In truth, the sweet fragrances of divine love can be inhaled from him. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one and give him glad tidings of God's favors. This evanescent servant implores God to aid him in all conditions in such wise that he may arise as befits the Days of God and exert mighty efforts for the guidance of humanity. This is the station which neither perishes nor is altered by the vicissitudes of time. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! Due to the abundance of correspondence this time, there was no opportunity to send him a separate letter expressing devotion, as your letter arrived and this reply was hastily dispatched. God willing, within these few days a response to his letter which arrived through Shaykh S will be sent.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali and his brother Aqa Muhammad-Husayn and their cousin 'Abbas-Quli. Mention of them was made in the Most Holy Court and these exalted words descended from the heaven of the Will, the Source of verses. His exalted Word:\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! Convey greetings to each one from God and counsel them to the Greater Steadfastness. Praise be to God, they have attained mention by the Supreme Pen, and this is a station that will endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. God willing, may they be aided in matters that cause the exaltation of God's Cause. Say: Today two calls are raised - the Beloved of all possibility calls out with the most exalted call, summoning souls to the supreme horizon, while likewise the source of vain imaginings misleads people in the name of truth. God willing, may you be focused on truth, hold fast to the cord of His Cause, and cling to the hem of His grace. Every deed manifested today by God's loved ones is recorded as among the greatest of deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed are they who fulfill God's covenant and testament, and woe to those who cast the covenant behind them and turned on their heels - they are among the perished ones.\n\nOn behalf of this evanescent servant, convey greetings to each one. God willing, may they be aided in that which is pleasing to God. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - states that all exist that they might attain the word of His good-pleasure. Now praise be to God, these souls have attained God's mention and are illumined by the lights of His grace. This is a great bounty and a mighty favor, to which every discerning and informed one bears witness.\n\nYou also mentioned the people of Milan. Numerous Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of Will concerning them and were previously sent. At this time too, mention was made in the Most Holy Court and this utterance appeared from the Kingdom of knowledge. His mighty Word: \\[...\\]\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! Blessed art thou for having remembered My loved ones and sent their names to My prison. Give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My loving-kindness, and My mercy which has preceded existence itself. O people of Milan! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, remembers you from this exalted station. Blessed are ye for having drunk of My sealed wine through My Self-Subsisting Name and for having attained unto this Cause which the learned of the earth have denied, save whom God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, has willed. We have mentioned you before and at this hour when the Wronged One walks in His forbidden prison. How many a mystic has his mysticism barred from the All-Merciful, and how many a child has turned and attained unto this ordained Cause! Blessed is the servant who has attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of all beings, and woe unto him who has turned away and followed every veiled learned one. Rejoice in that ye have been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen at this dawn wherein the Tongue of God, the Lord of Names, speaks forth. The appointed time has come and the Revealer of verses has appeared with a preserved tablet. God willing, may all be enkindled by hearing the divine call and, absorbed by the heat of the Most Exalted Word, become vocal with the mention of the Most Great Name in the assemblage of the world. Say: Know ye the value of this precious day and act according to that which ye have been commanded in the Book. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause that whosoever has today attained unto the recognition of the Truth is recorded and inscribed among the near ones in the Perspicuous Book. All must manifest themselves among the servants through pure deeds, pleasing character, and goodly conduct. Say: O friends of Truth! He has come for love and unity, not for rancor and enmity. Gather ye all beneath the Ultimate Tree, that is, the Most Exalted Word, and occupy yourselves with the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory, and drink from the crimson cups the pure water of Kawthar in the name of the Lord of Names. Today is the day of the Most Great Joy; nay, the Most Great Joy has circled and will circle round this joy. Be ye joyous in remembrance of the Peerless Friend and walk in the gardens of His love. Blessed are ye, then blessed are ye! We counsel you at the end of this utterance to be steadfast in the Cause of your Lord, the Lord of Religions. The glory shining forth from the Most Exalted Horizon be upon you and upon those whom neither the tempests of doubts nor the storms of idle fancies have moved from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAnd likewise does this evanescent servant beseech you to mention his extinction and nothingness in the gathering of the divine friends. God is aware and witness that their mention has been and God willing will be before His face and His pen.\n\nAnd mention was made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence of him who bears the name of the Desired One, son of the late Haji Ghulam-Husayn from the Land of Ya. His exalted Word:\n\nIn Our Name, the Most Holy, the Most Great\n\nO Husayn-'Ali! There has come before the Wronged One a letter from him who was named Abu'l-Hasan in the Book of Names, wherein thou wast mentioned. We have mentioned thee as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Rejoice thou in this mention which, when it descended from the heaven of thy Lord's will, caused all things to be attracted and to cry out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting!\" Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and say \\[...\\]\n\nO Thou through Whom the path was established and the Balance set up, and by Whose Name the Breath of God wafted over all creation! O Thou at Whose most sweet call those in earth and heaven were thunderstruck! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Word whereby Thou didst subdue the cities of the unseen and the seen, to assist me in Thy remembrance and the service of Thy Cause, and to enable me to achieve that steadfastness which Thou hast mentioned in most of Thy Tablets and enjoined upon Thy creatures and servants. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent before Whose manifestation the embodiments of power bowed down in submission. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe intention of this lowly one in this station is clear and evident, namely that you should mention on my behalf to them whatsoever may kindle the fire of love. It is hoped that they may drink of the living waters from the verses of the Beloved of all creation, and, detached from the world and all therein, may be observed to stand firm, steadfast and unwavering in the Divine Cause. The command is in His grasp; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.\n\nAs to what you wrote concerning the friends of Alif and Ra, some time ago Most Holy and Most Great Tablets were revealed from the heaven of divine bounty specifically for each one. If God should will and desire it, they shall attain unto them. The mention of his honor Fath-i-A'zam, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath ever been and still is before the Most Holy Court. The Supreme Pen hath testified concerning him to that which shall cause his remembrance to endure throughout the kingdom of utterance for as long as the Most Beautiful Names shall last. This matter too was presented before the Most Holy and Most Great Court. These exalted words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the utterance of the All-Merciful - exalted be His Word:\n\nIn His Name, the One sanctified above all mention and comparison \\[...\\]\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, wherein thou didst make mention of My loved ones who have turned towards My horizon, soared in My atmosphere, and hearkened unto My call. They are assuredly among the triumphant ones. We have previously made mention of them in such wise that the Manifestations of the Names inhaled from it the fragrance of the garment of their Most Glorious Lord, Who hath come from the heaven of destiny with a sovereignty that hath subdued all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named the Most Great Victory by the Ancient King, that through his remembrance every sorrowful one may rejoice, every frozen one may take wing, every stationary one may hasten, and every silent one may speak. We have withheld this wise remembrance, and make mention instead of his brother who turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon when every heedless and remote one turned away. We give him the glad-tidings of God's grace and mercy, and this remembrance wherewith the tongue of the Wronged One hath spoken in this mighty prison. Be as thy brother was - thus doth counsel thee He with Whom is the gracious Book. Arise to serve the Cause with supreme steadfastness and remind the people of this News which hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nWe make mention in this station of Muhammad, who was remembered before the Countenance and attained unto the recognition of God in His days and spoke His beauteous praise. We counsel him to preserve what We have given him and to act in accordance with what God hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. We make mention of the beloved one who turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from this luminous station. We make mention of My loved ones in that land and summon them unto a station round which circle the Concourse on High and they who have taken hold of the Book with strength from the presence of One mighty and powerful.\n\nBlessed are ye, O loved ones of the All-Merciful, and joy be unto you, O My chosen ones! Ye are they whom vain imaginings have not hindered from the Hidden Name, nor have idle fancies veiled from this luminous Day. Ye are they who have heard the call of your Lord, who have hastened unto the Most Great Ocean, and who are numbered among the triumphant ones.\n\nThe Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of the friends of that land and commandeth them to that which beseemeth the Day of God. The first command hath been the recognition of God, glorified be His majesty, and thereafter steadfastness in this Most Great Cause. All divine Scriptures, Books and Psalms have testified to the greatness of this Day. Blessed are they whom the clamor of the daysprings of idle fancies and vain imaginings hath not kept back from the Lord of all beings. This is the Day of service and the manifestation of steadfastness, for the birds of darkness and the birds of night are soaring in the gloomy atmosphere, seeking after their own kind. The Most Exalted Pen hath previously given tidings of these matters. O friends! Gaze with penetrating vision toward the Most Exalted Horizon and arise with upright feet, that ye may be preserved from the autumn winds. Those souls who for years remained hidden behind the veil out of fear for their lives are now engaged with the utmost deceit and guile in leading astray receptive souls. O friends of Truth! Stand firm with the utmost power and strength, and preserve the people from the daysprings of idle fancies and the dawning-places of vain imaginings, that perchance through the lights of the Sun of Truth the darkness of idle fancies may be dispelled and the brilliant morn of certitude may dawn forth from the horizon of the Divine Will. Every word hath had and shall have its own fragrance. Blessed are they who have attained unto this fragrance and recognized its source.\n\nO God of Names and Creator of Heaven! We hear the lamentation and cry of the Glory by reason of what hath befallen Him at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creation and the rebellious among Thy servants. O Lord! He whom Thou didst nurture with the hands of loving-kindness and favor hath risen to frustrate Thy Cause and mislead Thy creation and Thy creatures. Thou knowest, O my God, that I have desired naught on earth save what Thou didst command me through Thy bidding and Thy sovereignty. O Lord! Aid Thy servants to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens. Then cause them to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness by the hands of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nAnd specifically for his honor R and M.H. and H.B., wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed and given to his honor Sheikh S to deliver. God willing, may they attain unto them and drink from the ocean of inner meanings. Although this evanescent servant, after the suns of divine utterances have risen from the horizon of the All-Merciful's expression, does not consider himself worthy to offer praise and commendation in service to the friends of God, yet since all are commanded to love and unity, I therefore count it among my duties to manifest evanescence and nothingness in service to His loved ones and chosen ones to the extent of my capacity. In this case, I convey greetings and glorification to the friends of that land - that is, those souls who have drunk from the most pure Kawthar and who are gazing toward the Most Great Scene - and I submit that, God willing, in this spiritual springtime you may be verdant and flourishing from the rain-showers of the All-Merciful's mercy and be accounted among the flowers and blossoms of the garden of inner meanings. With the hands of endeavor, lay hold of the hem of steadfastness that perchance you may remain protected from the winds of the allusions of the heedless. This servant beseeches his Lord to grant you success and aid you in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is in the Most Exalted Scene. And peace be upon him who follows guidance.\n\nAnd you had mentioned the people of Maraghih, namely his honor Aqa Muhammad-'Ali and his honor Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-Husayn and his honor Aqa 'Abdu'?-?amad and his son and other friends, may the Glory of God be upon them all. God willing, may they all be illumined by the effulgent lights of the Sun of inner meanings and be aided in the mention and praise of the Eternal Beloved. This matter too was submitted in the Most Great Scene before the face of the Lord of Power. This reply was sent down from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful's utterance, His exalted Word:\n\nHe is the Dawning One from the horizon of the world through the Most Great Name.\n\nO My loved ones in Maraghih! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Oneness. He maketh mention of you even as He mentioned you before, as a token of His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We have sent down unto you diverse Tablets and dispatched them to you by Our command, for verily I am the Commander, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Turn ye all unto God, then act according to that which ye have been commanded by an All-Informed Sovereign. This is a Day wherein the Balance speaketh. By God! The All-Merciful hath come with a mighty Cause. On this Day the Mount calleth out saying: \"The Day of Manifestation hath come! The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Great.\" Be grateful unto Him Who hath aided you to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and the Dayspring of His knowledge, and Who hath acquainted you with this Straight Path. He hath guided you to the Supreme Horizon and caused you to hear His most sweet call while He was wronged at the hands of the heedless ones.\n\nO people of Maraghih! Previously, most sweet mention of you hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen. God willing, may ye all attain unto it and strive that ye may truly be nourished by the sweetness of utterance. For should a soul attain unto it, the intimations of the people of the world, the veils of the nations, the tablets of the deniers, and the tongues of the falsifiers shall not withhold him from the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. By the life of God! Should a soul drink of this most pure wine which hath been unsealed by the hand of might of the Lord of Destiny, he shall find himself detached from the world and all who dwell therein for the sake of the Beloved of all possibility, to such extent that he shall regard the falsifiers, the deniers, the godless, and the transgressors as mere nothingness and utter non-existence.\n\nArise with complete steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of all beings. This is a Day wherein every soul can attain unto whatsoever he desireth, for the doors of bounty are opened wide, the ocean of generosity is surging, and the sun of bounty is shining and shedding its radiance. And if in certain matters the appearances of grace be delayed, this hath been and shall be due to God's consummate wisdom. One must not become saddened by this. Thus doth the Most Great Book teach you that whereby the world hath been illumined. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the All-Loving.\n\nAs to what ye had mentioned regarding the loved ones of the land of Qum, it was presented before the Throne. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that whereby the hearts of the world were attracted and the nations were thunderstruck, save whom God, the Most High, the Most Great, willed. His word, exalted be His majesty:\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! We have made mention of Our loved ones in that place and have revealed for him who was named Rida that whereby the Concourse on High was attracted, and We have revealed for him who was named Husayn that whereby the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Exalted be the All-Merciful, the Manifestation of this mighty Cause! We had previously sent unto them both that whereby the horizons were perfumed, yet the people remain in evident veils. Should thou meet them both, convey unto them the greetings from the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of God's bounty, the Lord of all worlds. Say: Blessed are ye both for having turned unto a horizon from which every stubborn tyrant and every doubtful learned one hath turned away. My Most Exalted Pen hath borne witness unto you both. Rejoice ye in this most great favor and in this mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nO friends! This Wronged One, at this hour when the sun is at its meridian, has turned towards you, makes mention of you, and counsels you regarding that which ensures steadfastness in the Cause of God. For the transgressors, the corruptors and the evil ones are striving with utmost effort to lead astray the loved ones of Truth. It behooved God, exalted be His glory, to inform His friends. Thus did We forewarn all of the appearance of the croakers and the cawing of the heedless, that they might remain protected through the name of Truth in this wondrous Day. They must, God willing, be observed to be so firmly established and immovable in the Cause of God that none would have power even to speak, much less to hinder. Thus has the Tongue spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance. Blessed is he that heareth, and woe unto the heedless ones. That which hath proceeded from you in the path of God is clear and evident before the Truth. Verily, He draweth nigh unto whosoever draweth nigh unto Him, and rewardeth most excellently whoso acteth in His path. He, verily, is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. May God willing, be ye protected from the enemies of Truth and their insinuations. O Abu'l-Hasan! Some of the associates are also dwelling in that land. Previously, wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed and sent especially for them. God willing, they have attained unto them. And if thou meetest them this time, convey to them profound greetings from the Truth and say: \"May you be blessed, God willing, with divine favors and act according to His command.\" Specifically for the two souls mentioned, Husayn and Rida, upon them be the glory of God, two most mighty Tablets were revealed and sent with the letter Sin. God willing, may they attain unto them. The end belongs to the God-fearing, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the sons of Mulla 'Abdu'l-Ghafur, from the relatives of Mulla Raj, upon him be the glory of God, it was presented before the Most Sublime Vision. This is what the All-Giving hath revealed in response:\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! We have made mention of him who is named Malik-Husayn, and We make mention of him at this hour when the Wronged One walketh in His Most Great Prison and testifieth to that which He testified before the existence of all created things: that there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God's life! This is a Day which the books of the world have been adorned with its mention, and the denizens of the highest Paradise and they who circle round the Throne have spoken its praise, by the command of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is a Day wherein the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted, yet most of the people are heedless. They have cast certainty behind their backs and followed the sources of idle fancies. Thus have their souls enticed them. Verily, they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Malik-Husayn! Dost thou hear My most sweet call from the Most Exalted Horizon, or art thou among the heedless? Open thy sight through the name of thy Lord that thou mayest behold the Sun shining from this luminous horizon. Turn not unto those whom thou seest in doubt concerning the Cause of thy Lord. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Speaker, the All-Informed. Should anyone come to thee with tales of old, leave them behind thee, turning towards the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\"\n\nWe make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Baqir, that the call of the All-Merciful may draw him nigh unto the Kingdom of Utterance and strengthen him in steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the knowers have slipped. When thou hearest the call from the direction of the luminous Spot, say:\n\n\"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, for having made known unto me the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, and for having guided me unto Thy Straight Path.\"\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named 'Ali and give him the glad-tidings of this Remembrance which cannot be equalled by all the treasures of the earth nor by that which is with the kings and rulers. O 'Ali! The Wronged One remembereth thee when sorrows have encompassed Him from those who disputed the signs of God and His proof, and turned away from that which they were commanded in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Take thou the choice wine of steadfastness in the name of the Lord of Oneness, then drink thereof once in remembrance of Me and again in My Name, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nO Rida! Draw nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon. By God! Thou wast created for this Day. To this testify the Scriptures of God, both past and future, and beyond them this most impregnable, most holy, mighty and glorious Remembrance. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the Lord of all creation, with supreme steadfastness, and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Thou Who didst remember me through Thy grace and didst enable me to turn unto the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have cast away the world for love of Thee and Thy path, and who have hastened to the place of annihilation in remembrance of Thee and Thy Name. O my Lord! Thou art the Powerful, and Thou seest the weak one clinging to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. Write down, then, for him that which befitteth Thy greatness and power. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nWe make mention at this moment of him who hath been named Husayn, that the breezes of remembrance may draw him to a station wherein the tongue of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, doth speak. O Husayn! Husayn remembereth thee, He Who arose to the Cause in days wherein the limbs of the world trembled at the onslaught of princes and the opposition of divines. Thus hath the Lord of Names spoken from the Most Exalted Horizon, yet most of the people understand not. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and informed all of what hath appeared and what shall appear in the earth. To this testifieth he who hath testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth, and before the mention of the letter K and N. Hold thou fast unto the cord of certitude, turning away from those whom We behold in doubt concerning this mighty, this impregnable Cause. He hath, of a truth, forgiven thy father as a token of His grace, for He is the Kind, the Forgiving.\n\nO Hasan! The Most Exalted Pen speaketh in the Persian tongue that all may attain unto that which God hath desired. Say: Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and be not deprived by the doubts of the deniers and those who have turned away from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. This is the day of the most great terror and likewise of the most great joy. Blessed is the one whom the veils of glory and the obscuring doubts and the allusions of the followers of idle fancy have not withheld from the recognition of the Manifest, the Hidden Name. Today the Lord of Names bestoweth, with His white hand, the water of everlasting life. Draw ye nigh through His power and take thereof in His Name, then drink therefrom through His wise remembrance. The evil ones have ever lain in wait, and likewise the deceitful and the treacherous stand ready at their posts that perchance they might prevent a soul from the truth and deprive it of the outpourings of the true Bestower. Strive ye that ye may become the breakers of the idols of vain imaginings. Whatsoever hath appeared and shall appear in the world hath previously flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Say: O servants! Consider ye the Tablets to the kings and ponder the Tablet to the Chief, that ye might perchance speak with fairness and tread the path of justice. The Cause is greater than to be veiled by unseemly and unworthy statements. Fear ye God, O people, and follow not the desires of those who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful when He came with clear proof. Thus doth He remind you, He in Whose possession is a mighty Book.\n\nWe make mention in this station of My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of all worlds, and We give them glad tidings of God's loving-kindness and His grace that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. O handmaidens of God! God willing, ye shall be observed as sanctified and pure from the doubts and allusions of men, and in all conditions hold fast unto the Self-Sufficing Lord. These are days wherein God, exalted be His glory, hath turned toward all and adorned all with the ornament of His mention. Jesus, son of Mary, upon hearing but one blessed word from the Dayspring of divine utterance, became so enkindled with the fire of love that the waters of the world could neither prevent nor extinguish it. And that word was this: \"O My servant and son of My handmaiden!\" And now grace hath reached such heights that He Who conversed on Sinai from the seat of the throne of Revelation makes mention of both male and female, young and old, with wondrous words of remembrance. Should anyone truly ponder this blessed word, he would spend his entire life uttering \"Thine be the praise, O God of all worlds!\" Beseech ye God that He suffer not your ears to be defiled by the utterances of the corrupt, the aggressive, and the treacherous, nor your eyes to be barred by the allusions of the deniers from beholding the lights, that ye may hearken unto the essence of utterance and perceive the essence of light. Is there any fair-minded hearer in the world who will hear and speak the truth? Is there any just observer to be found who will behold the truth and bear witness to that which God hath witnessed? Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the midst of sorrows through what the hands of those who cast their God behind their backs and took idols for themselves as lords besides God, the Mighty, the Powerful, have wrought. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon those who have turned toward the Most Great Scene with pure vision, and upon those handmaidens who have hearkened to the Call and turned unto God, the Lord of Names, on this mighty, exalted Day.\n\nAll praise be unto God that all the souls mentioned have attained unto the divine verses, and the ocean of utterance hath surged for each one. God willing, they shall arise to that which beseemeth this most great bounty and shall attain unto that which God hath willed. This evanescent servant at all times beseecheth and imploreth God that He may aid souls to recognize this most great favor that hath encompassed the world. He is verily the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nFurthermore, ye made mention of Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God. After its presentation before the Most Holy Court, these resplendent words were revealed from the Source of Command. He saith, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn His Name, the Sanctified above all that was and that shall be \\[...\\]\n\nO Muhammad-Qabil-Rida! By the True One! The Promise hath appeared and the Promised One hath come, proclaiming from the heart of the world: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting! I have created all things for this Day and have heralded unto them this Revelation wherein the very pebbles proclaim 'The Kingdom belongeth to the Revealer of verses' and wherein the nightingale warbleth upon the branches 'Glory be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be!'\" Among men are those who dispute the signs of God and deny His proof, and those who slander Him without clear evidence or an enlightening Book, and those who pronounce judgment against Him. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Revelation while confined in this forbidden prison. How many learned ones have been barred from true knowledge by following vain imaginings, and how many unlettered ones have hastened to attain My choice sealed wine! This is the Day whereon the Tongue of Revelation speaketh, and that which God foretold through the tongue of His Messenger hath come to pass - the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen. Abandon all remembrances and hold fast unto this glorious and beloved Remembrance.\n\nSay: O my God! I beseech Thee by the Revealer of Thy verses and the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation, and by Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes, to make me steadfast in this Cause whereby the earth hath been cleft and the mountains have been scattered. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O Lord! Thou seest me turning away from all else but Thee and advancing toward the Kaaba of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee to withhold not from me the wonders of Thy bounty; then ordain for me by Thy Pen that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all names. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nConvey My greetings unto the faces of those whom God hath associated with thee, that the fragrances of glorification may attract them to God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Say: O people! By God, the Day hath come and the Self-Subsisting calleth aloud through this Name whereby God hath subdued all that was and that shall be. Say: Beware lest the veils of them that are wrapt in veils withhold you from God, the Lord of all worlds. Cast away what is possessed by men and take what hath been vouchsafed unto you from the presence of a Mighty, Bountiful One. Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the Tablet of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Blessed is he who hath advanced and woe unto them that turn away.\n\nI swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctification that divine favor hath reached such a station that the tongues of the world are powerless and fall short of its mention. Yet, O My loved one, the people have clung to an imaginary creature of which they had and have no knowledge, and have deprived themselves of the divine oceans of grace. Supplicate ye the All-Knowing, the Powerful, with utmost humility and lowliness throughout the days and nights that He may not afflict these souls anew with vain imaginings and idle fancies. At all times a putrid odor is moving and passing, to such an extent that the Pen is reluctant to make mention thereof and shall remain so. The servant beseecheth his Lord to guard His servants from the hosts of men and vain desire, and to confirm them in that which He loveth and approveth. This is what shall profit them in this world and the next, and He verily is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed.\n\nFurthermore, ye had mentioned Mulla Abdul-Ghani, upon him be the Glory of God. All that ye had written was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what shone forth from the horizon of the providence of our Lord, the Most Merciful. His word, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names \\[...\\]\n\nO Abdul-Ghani! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. By My life! If thou wert to hear it as it should be heard, verily it would draw thee to a station sanctified by God beyond the mention of the ancients and the tidings of them that are yet to come. Make thyself ready to hearken unto the words of thy Lord, which have been sent down in such wise that from them the fragrance of the garment hath been wafted between earth and heaven. Blessed is he who heareth, whom the hosts have not deterred; and blessed is he who seeth, whom the veils have not hindered; and blessed is he who turneth, whom the rejection of the rejecters hath not frightened. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God and its influence, turn with thy heart to the Dayspring of Names, the station from whose horizon have shone forth the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Master of all beings, and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my Beloved, and glory be unto Thee, O my Heart's Desire, for having caused me to hear Thy call when I was heedless, and for making me turn to Thee when I was unmindful, and for giving me utterance when I was silent. I testify that Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth, and in Whose grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. O my Lord! Having caused me to hear Thy call, withhold me not from the outpourings of Thy days. Blessed is the air that hath been perfumed by Thy breezes, and the earth that hath been honored by Thy footsteps, and the mountain over which have wafted the breezes of Thy Revelation, and the gardens that have been adorned by the flowers from the gardens of Thy knowledge. O my Lord! I am poor and needy, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the All-Bountiful. Behold me, then, O my God, with the glances of Thy loving-kindness, and grant me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, of whom Thou hast spoken in praise in Thy Books, Thy Scrolls, and Thy Tablets. O my Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy Cause, assist me in Thy service, and enable me to remain constant in my love for Thee. Verily Thou art He to Whose power and might all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and dominion all things possible have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nThe bounty, loving-kindness, compassion and mercy of the True One, exalted be His glory and greatness, are manifest and evident from the verses sent down from the heaven of oneness. O friends of God! Know ye the value of yourselves and of these days, that ye may perchance be preserved from the arrows of Satan and the intimations of the corrupt ones. All that ye have expressed in your letter was presented at the Most Holy Court, and in supreme bounty and compassion the answer to each was revealed and sent forth, that all may receive their portion from the true, ever-flowing ocean of grace. It is requested that on behalf of this evanescent servant ye convey greetings, praise and salutations to the friends of God. God willing, may all arise to accomplish that which God loveth, and strive with utmost joy and fragrance to teach the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds. This is the divine counsel from before and after. We beseech God to assist all to serve His Cause, for without His grace none hath ever been, nor shall ever be, capable of any deed. As for your having appointed this evanescent one as your representative in visitation, in accordance with your wish, he hath at this moment turned toward the Most Holy Court and acted on your behalf in that which is the purpose of the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou and blessed am I. After attendance, presentation and visitation, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words, exalted be His glory: \\[...\\]\n\nO Abu'l-Hasan! Praise be to God, through divine bestowals thou hast attained again and again, and hast made mention of the friends of God and His loved ones. We bear witness that thou hast mentioned their names and visited them and presented what they have wrought in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Reflect upon God's grace: that which all who dwell on earth sought with utmost longing and desire was attained by none save a few, yet through His grace and mercy thou didst attain His presence and drink from the Kawthar of reunion and recognize His Day, and wert enabled to make mention of His loved ones. Each of these stations is most lofty and exalted. Strive that through the name of God and His grace thou mayest remain protected. Verily He is the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThis lowly one submits that several days ago a word was heard from the blessed tongue indicating the agitation of certain weak souls due to the doubts cast by the deniers and corrupters. Perhaps this has had some effect on the relatives as well. According to His command, whatever was sent to your honor, as well as to Varqa - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - and some friends in the Land of Ta, should be gathered so that the friends of God may observe. Verily He is the Commander, the All-Wise. And if a copy thereof be given to Mulla Raj - upon him be the Glory of God - it would be most pleasing. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who heed the counsel of their Lord and who have drunk the wine of steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nThe Servant\n\n14 Sha'ban 1298\n\n=== END BH00036 ===\n\n=== START BH00037 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise and thanksgiving befit the people of God in a station where they are inwardly like a surging ocean, yet outwardly, in accordance with the wisdom they are bidden to observe, are calm and patient. They have crossed the river of names and reached the shore of the ocean of inner meanings. Detached from the world, they have turned to the horizon of the Most Great Name. The hues and stains of various parties do not prevent them from attaining the true station of repose, which is the station of supreme steadfastness. They speak for God, turn to God, and return unto God. The veils of the world have not obscured them, nor have the clouds of the nations held them back from what God hath willed. They are the dawning-places of the reformation of the world and the manifestations of the wisdom of the Lord of Eternity. When they observe fertile soil, they deposit the seed of wisdom; when they find ears to hear, they speak. This prescribed wisdom hath ever been and shall continue to be a fortress for the friends of God. As long as the ocean surgeth, the sun shineth, and the heaven remaineth lofty and adorned, they must arise with the utmost endeavor to serve. Among the forms of service is wisdom itself, which they must impart to the friends of God, that all may be educated and become the cause of the exaltation of His Cause, rather than the clamor of the heedless and the aggressive.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose command the laws were ordained and proofs and evidences were made manifest! The Servant testifieth that the tongue of Thy Will hath spoken naught but that which is a shield for Thy servants and a crown for the heads of Thy loved ones. In all that Thou hast sent down from the kingdom of Thy grace and favor, Thou hast desired naught save that which draweth them nigh unto Thee and causeth them to recognize what Thou hast willed through Thy bounty and loving-kindness. O Lord! Aid Thy servants to act according to what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. Then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs and have broken Thy covenant and Thy pledge. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and the hands of Thy power in the world of creation to assist Thy chosen ones and loved ones to arise to serve Thy Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the learned nor the allusions of the divines nor the might of princes shall hold them back. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThereafter, I submit that your esteemed letter was received - a receipt that heralded the world of meeting. In truth, the letters and messages of God's loved ones emit the fragrance of reunion. Praise be to God, every letter thereof testified to your steadfastness, which today is like the elixir - precious indeed is that elixir which adorns the transient with the ornament of the eternal. And after joy, delight and gladness, proceeding to the station of the Lord of all beings, following presence before His face and complete permission, the letter was honored to be heard. His Word - exalted be His proof and mighty His utterance:\n\nIn the name of the Goal of the worlds \\[...\\]\n\nStrange and peculiar affairs have come to pass. The carpet of idle fancies hath been spread wider than before. At one time they speak of interpolations, at another of an island and region. Glory be to God! Until now they have not understood a single letter of the Mother Book and are unaware of the Day of God. They cling to names while calling themselves the people of God, yet He is quit of them. To this My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness in this mighty and impregnable station. The winds of self and passion have seized these heedless souls and carry them whithersoever they desire. By God! They appear like the people of old, nay worse. Today the light of true oneness hath dawned from the horizon of the world and none but the Truth is mentioned. With the banner \"Verily I am God\" it hath descended from the most exalted summit, and with the standard \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" it hath appeared. By My life! Had they understood the Divine Day, they would have found all who dwell on earth as non-existent. Today no mention among mentions and no matter among matters sufficeth except this Most Great Remembrance and Mighty News. For twelve hundred years the people of old strayed from the straight path, yet deemed themselves guides to the way. But when the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the world, the deeds of those souls and their fruits became clear and evident - this is not hidden from any possessor of insight. Blessed art thou, O Husayn, for having turned to the Most Sublime Horizon and drunk the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and attained the greatest steadfastness in the days of God, the Lord of all beings. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee and make thee successful in exalting His Word amongst His servants, and to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Until now the transgressors have not perceived the fragrance of God's Cause, let alone the Truth itself. With utmost deceit and guile they have arisen to mislead the people. In truth, the eyes of the world are incapable of beholding this horizon, and the ears of the world are unworthy of hearing this utterance. Beseech the Truth to raise up souls created from the element of sanctity, that they may attain unto vision and hearing, and find themselves detached and free from all else but God. The existing souls possess ears yet are deprived of hearing, have eyes yet are forbidden from seeing. \"They have eyes wherewith they see not.\" Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God. Say: Strive to protect the servants, that perchance their words may not prevent them from the ocean of meanings, that names may not become a veil and hold them back from the Truth. The glory shining forth from the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon them that have turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon and believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed.\n\nThe waves of the ocean of utterance have appeared in such wise that were the world to possess hearing and sight to the extent of a needle's eye, all would turn from what they possess to what is with God. Yet the heedless people each day cling to some new thing and soar in some new atmosphere. The verses of God descend and pour forth like rain, and His evidences shine forth and appear from every horizon. Nevertheless, they remain occupied with ringing sounds, heedless and veiled from the Lord of all worlds. Bewilderment has reached such a state that its description is beyond the power of pen and ink. In truth, divine wrath has seized them and the recompense of their deeds has become manifest. These mentions are so that some may become aware. Repeatedly this exalted Word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of all beings - blessed and exalted be His utterance: \"O servant present! The Supreme Pen has repeatedly made mention of the deeds of the former party and their recompense on the Day of Resurrection. The purpose is that those who have turned to God may become aware, for if they would reflect and become informed of the fruits of the deeds of the former party, they would remain firm, steadfast and unwavering in the Cause of God in such wise that the doubts of the infidels and the gestures of the transgressors would not hinder them.\"\n\nRegarding what was written about the departed and elevated Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and the trusts that were with him - he himself had written a letter to this servant wherein the trusts of the friends of God were mentioned in detail. Now, after your letter was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, a most mighty and sublime Tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine will specifically for Nayib-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, and was sent. God willing, he will attain to it and become joyful with such joy that the troubles of the world will not affect him. This servant also conveys greetings to him and begs confirmation from the Truth. Likewise, a Tablet was graciously revealed specifically for Karbila'i Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, and what they sent has arrived. Not an atom of deeds has been or is hidden. The servant asks his Lord to confirm them and those who have believed in steadfastness in His love and His mighty and wondrous Cause.\n\nAfter that departed one's passing, whatever was with him was brought to the Most Holy Presence, as was detailed in writing to the honored mother of that departed one, upon them both be the Glory of God. This evanescent one has, in most times, made mention of them and of the patient leaf, the mother, upon her be the Glory of God and His favors, as well as their relatives, upon them be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, they have been and are remembered before His presence. Blessed are they.\n\nConcerning what was written about the spiritual friend, Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, and sending what he had requested - from that very matter his station is clear and evident. That beloved one should reflect upon the heedless souls - to what they cling and with what they occupy themselves. There are many such instances. Would that the people understood! Those souls who today consider themselves believers and assured ones have never been and are not now aware of the foundation of the Cause. However, when the effulgences of the lights of the Manifestation somewhat shone forth, they ran out from behind the veil and say what they do not comprehend and speak of what they do not understand. Thus have their souls made a matter seem fair to them, and they know not today. Praise be to God that beloved one has attained to the mention of Truth, the praise of Truth, and the assistance of the Cause of Truth. Concerning what was written about the honored matron Varaqatu'l-Firdaws, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and her turning toward Faran and the steadfastness and enkindlement of the loved ones of God in that land - all was presented before the Presence and attained the honor of being heard. His word, exalted be His station and sublime be His utterance: In My Name, through which the ocean of utterance surged \\[...\\]\n\nThis is a Book inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds. God hath made it the Dayspring of Guidance unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. O people of Faran! Ye were favored with the mention of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in the past and are so at this time when We are surrounded by the wolves and dogs of the earth through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Beware lest anything whatsoever debar you from the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. Cast aside this day what the people possess, clinging fast to the cord of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.\n\nWe have arisen to manifest the Cause before the faces of men in such wise that neither the clamor of the wicked, nor chains and fetters, nor the prison of Akka could deter Us. To this testifieth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. O party of God! Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan debar you even as the doubts of the people of the Furqan debarred them when the All-Merciful came with great sovereignty. The gate of heaven hath been opened and He Who was promised by the tongue of Grandeur and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen hath come. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto Him and attained. Woe unto them that have turned away!\n\nThey behold the waves of the ocean yet deny them. They are indeed the companions of hellfire. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to what they possess of the promptings of Satan. Say: That which the people possess shall profit you not this day. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Take ye the Book of God with His might and His power. Verily it is His Balance amidst you and His Path before your faces, if ye be of them that know. The Concourse of the Bayan have denied the heaven of grace and its stars and the Sun and its effulgence. Thus have their souls enticed them and they are today among the most lost in the Book of God, the True Sovereign, the Just, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Concourse of the Bayan! Be fair in the Cause of the All-Merciful and weigh what ye possess against but one verse from the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds. There hath appeared what hath never appeared in creation. To this testifieth every fair-minded, clear-sighted one. They who have been given insight from God have heard and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, for having manifested Thyself among the peoples, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of them that know.\"\n\nHe whom We reared with the hands of grace and preserved beneath the wing of justice hath risen in opposition and drawn against My face the sword of hatred, having been led astray by one of the wicked ones. When God revealed what was hidden in their breasts, they arose and cried out whereat the denizens of the all-highest Paradise and they that circle round the mighty Throne lamented. They have made calumnies their shield. Say: By God! Nothing shall profit you save this Name at Whose appearance the people of the cities of vain imaginings have wailed, and every mighty idol hath fallen upon its face.\n\nO party of God! Recite ye the verses of God. They will guide you to the straight path of God. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and made clear the way, yet most of the people are heedless. They worship idols and know not; they follow vain imaginings and perceive not. Say: Be fair, O Concourse of the Bayan, regarding this Cause through which all things have proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign Protector, the Self-Subsisting!\" If ye deny the kingdom of the Bayan, by what proof can ye establish what ye possess? Bring it forth! By God! What ye possess cannot equal one word from Us. To this testifieth He Who opened through His name the gate of knowledge and unsealed through His command the Choice Wine. Whoso denieth this Cause, the world and all that is therein laugh at him, did they but perceive it. O party of God in Faran! We counsel you with that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of what was \\[...\\]\n\nO people of God in Faran! We counsel you with that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, may be exalted, and with the preservation of the pearls of your love from every rejected thief. This is the Day of steadfastness, and this is the Day wherein every hidden secret and every treasured matter hath been revealed. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen revealed its mysteries and the sea its waves. Blessed are they who recognize the splendor that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of My grace upon you and upon those who have forsaken the world, turning unto God, the Sovereign of the realm of dominion and sovereignty.\n\nAll atoms stand bewildered at mankind's lack of awareness. The scratching of the Most Exalted Pen is raised during the nights and days, and the Sun of Utterance is shining and manifest from the highest horizon of possibility. This is that Call which the Beloved heard during His ascension and Moses heard on Sinai and by which he was made to prosper. It is not known with what the heedless souls are occupied and to what they cling and in what they rejoice. By the life of our Lord and your Lord! Were anyone to observe with the eye of fairness, he would behold himself immersed in an ocean of wonderment. There hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which those who would enumerate are powerless to reckon and those who would record are impotent to write. Despite this, they have uttered that which no people have ever uttered and committed that which no soul hath ever committed. I beseech God to set ablaze the people of Faran and those drawn to Him with such a fire that the people of that land shall be enkindled thereby and no opportunity for objection shall remain for the opposers. Should anyone reflect upon this most great Revelation, he would observe this Cause to transcend the world and all therein. He would become detached from mere words and turn toward the ocean of meanings. Verily, He speaketh the truth and guideth the way.\n\nO people of this village! Ye have hearkened unto the melody of the Supreme Pen and beheld the surging waves of the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Every possessor of spiritual sense hath inhaled the fragrance of His Revelation, and every possessor of sight hath turned towards the supreme horizon. Yet certain deluded ones among the people of the Bayan have risen in opposition, turning away from the ocean of divine utterance and advancing towards a mere pond. Like scattered locusts they strive and labor to lead souls astray. They walk in the footsteps of the former parties, though they witness with their own eyes the loss that hath befallen those parties. Fie upon them and their sense of justice!\n\nAll the divines of Persia, each of whom regarded himself as the heaven of knowledge, the mountain of piety, and the sun of faith, and considered his religion the most exalted among the religions of the world - all of them in the early years engaged in cursing and reviling the Object of the world's adoration, and ultimately issued the decree for His death from their idolatrous souls and pens. Even now they have not desisted. Day and night they occupy themselves with hatred towards Him Who created them. One wondereth from what element these essences of hatred have been created. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people!\n\nBy My life! My Pen weepeth both night and day over Him against Whom they pronounced their verdict without any clear proof or Book. Now the people of the Bayan too are occupied with the same delusions. The Supreme Pen hath repeatedly made mention of these matters and given utterance thereto, that perchance the people might become mindful and discover that which is hidden from their eyes. For were they to become aware of the deeds of the former party and the fruits thereof, they would regard those who turn aside as non-existent and as nothing. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist His loved ones and to acquaint them with that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nWe send greetings to each of the people of this village. The names of the sincere ones and the steadfast ones have been recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My remembrance, who hath held fast unto My cord, and who hath clung to the hem of My luminous robe. From this station We greet their faces and give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My mercy and My loving-kindness, which have preceded all things. And I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nWe make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Husayn, who hath been mentioned in the Book of him who turned to My horizon, who voiced My praise and who arose to serve My Cause, the Firm, the Impregnable. O Muhammad-Husayn! We have mentioned thee time and again as a token of grace from Us, that the verses might attract thee to a station wherein the affairs of the world will not sadden thee, nor will the doubts of the divines hold thee back from the Lord of all beings, Who hath come from the Dayspring of might with the standards of guidance and success. Blessed is he who hath heard and recognized. Woe unto them that deny!\n\nBy God's life! Whoso heareth My verses with the ear of his true nature, they will surely draw him nigh unto God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Behold, then remember when the Point came and said that should anyone come with a verse, ye should not deny him nor object to him. Yet the people of the Bayan objected to Him Who came with the kingdom of verses. Thus did the affairs of the world delude them until they disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great. He had decreed in the Book the sanctification of My Self from whatsoever was revealed in the Bayan - to this testifieth he who hath a perspicuous Book. Vain imaginings have withheld them from the Lord of all days, and idle fancies have debarred them from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThus have We revealed the verses and sent them unto thee, that they might attract thee to the praiseworthy station. When thou hearest My call and attainest unto My verses, say: \"My God, my God! Should I be prevented from standing before the gate of Thy grace and from attaining unto Thy presence, ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of meeting Thee. Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou pleasest. There is none other God but Thee, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\"\n\nThe All-Glorious remembers him who hath been named with My Name, and announceth unto him My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all created things. O Baha, the All-Glorious remembereth thee from the Prison of 'Akka, through which every Messenger was sent and every Book was revealed. He hath spoken: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Through Him was made manifest that which lay hidden in the knowledge of God, and the Truth came with manifest sovereignty. But for Him, no verses would have been revealed, nor any signs appeared, yet the people understand not. We have heard thy cry when thou didst read the Book of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. Recite that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen at eventide and at dawn. We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe wisdom and utterance, even as We counseled Our servants aforetime. To this testify honored servants. Say: O people of the Bayan! The River of Life hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Fear ye God, O people, and be not of those who denied when the Intended One came with manifest sovereignty. Say: Die in your wrath! The Resurrection is come, the Hour hath appeared, the Bridge hath been laid, the mountains have passed away, and those in the graves have been raised. By God! The ocean of utterance hath surged, yet the people understand not; and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, yet the people perceive it not. Thus hath spoken My Most Exalted Pen when the Wronged One was in the hands of every oppressor who denied the Witness and the Witnessed.\n\nO Land of Ba! Hearken to the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, from the right hand of the Luminous Spot. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. He Who was mentioned in the Book of God, the Lord of Lords, hath been made manifest. O people of God! I complain unto you concerning what hath befallen Me at the hands of a band of wolves who have violated God's Covenant and His Testament, and have disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan prevent you from your Lord, the All-Merciful. Leave them to their vain imaginings and turn ye towards the Dayspring of Light. They were concealed behind veils, and when the waves of hatred subsided and the light shone forth according to a fixed measure, they emerged therefrom and perpetrated that which caused the eye of grandeur to weep in the most exalted station. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who hath quaffed the wine of steadfastness from the hands of bounty and favor. He is indeed of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Revealer of verses. O people of the cities! Your Lord, the Lord of the Throne, maketh mention of you. Turn with radiant faces and illumined hearts unto God, the Lord of all return. We have made mention of every servant who hath turned towards the prison, and of every maidservant who hath believed in the Mighty, the Bestower. O people of God! Beware lest the intimations of the misguided keep you back from your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. He who hath recognized Me seeth himself stronger than all who dwell on earth. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken when the Wronged One was in such grief as no eye in all creation had ever witnessed.\n\nHere it endeth. His is the praise and the favor, and His is the loving-kindness and compassion. The Sun of bounty hath risen with such splendor that none hath the power to describe it. Wondrous and sublime verses have been revealed specifically for the mentioned names - from each letter thereof the fragrance of grace and bounty is wafted. This evanescent servant beseecheth the eternal Truth to confirm all to recognize that which is today manifest, evident and resplendent. For were they to attain unto a drop from the ocean of divine utterance, all would behold themselves independent of all else. Their vain imaginings shall not hold them back, nor shall names prevent them. Those who were and are incapable of speech have risen up with all manner of deceit and guile to mislead the people. They have uttered that which no ignorant one hath ever uttered. The chief of the barking ones hath appeared from the land of Kaf and Ra, and in his delusion imagineth that he is helping the Cause, just as the Shi'ih sect was occupied with such vain fancies and ultimately committed that which no oppressor had ever perpetrated since the beginning of creation. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people.\n\nO thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Afnan, upon him be My glory, hath from the beginning of the Cause until now stood firm in service to the Truth and His loved ones, and remained constant in His remembrance. He hath borne witness to that which God hath witnessed, acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged, and uttered that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Blessed is he, then blessed is he! Praise be to God, all have turned to the waters of mercy and drunk from the chalice of grace. We have made mention of them in numerous Tablets - a mention that causeth the ears of creation to incline towards the Word of God. We have favored some above others, and We are the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. We send Our greetings upon them and upon Our loved ones whom the buzzing of flies hath not kept back from God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed are they and theirs shall be a goodly retreat.\n\nHe hath said: Whenever a Tablet is to be sent to the Afnan himself, We shall make mention of that which they have requested. In truth, steadfast souls have been created for the service of the Cause of God. Naught shall remain for them save what they have wrought in the path of God, our Lord and their Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nAt this time and at this hour, these decisive verses specially intended for the people of rapture were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Creator of all things. His word, exalted be His mention and mighty His utterance:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Answerer\n\nO people of rapture! The Lord of Names maketh mention of you in that which draweth you nigh unto God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. We have made mention of you time and again, and have sent unto you that which caused bodies to take flight, and We make mention of you yet again at this time, and We remind you of the signs of God, the Lord of lords. Hearken unto the call from the direction of bounty and bestowal, before the faces of all humanity, from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. The Spirit of Life hath been breathed into you and the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over you. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The clamor hath been raised - this is what We foretold you aforetime in the Book of God, the Lord of the Final End. We have been hearing what hath been raised there, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Beware lest the doubts of the world hold you back from the Lord of Eternity, or the objections of the learned keep you from Him Who hath come with power and sovereignty.\n\nO party of God! This is spoken in the Persian tongue that ye may comprehend the purpose and remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. The objectors of the Bayan are like those souls who, in the early days of Islam, constructed through the instruments of idle fancies and vain imaginings that which caused the ruin of the world. O party of God! Consider all matters with penetrating vision and reflect: what were the fruits of the deeds of the Shi'ihs during twelve hundred years on the Day of Reckoning and what became of them? They raised their cry from pulpits and mosques and, in their own estimation, summoned mankind unto truth, while the various sects among that party pronounced each other infidels, each faction counting itself the defender of the resplendent Law. By the life of God! Thereby was the standard \"there is none other God but Him\" reversed, the Word was divided, the Lote-Tree lamented, and even now the Wronged One heareth its sighs and moans by reason of what hath befallen His own Self after We had assisted the Cause in days wherein souls were perturbed and eyes were dimmed. We stood before the faces of men and summoned all unto God, without veil or covering.\n\nWe beseech God to aid all to be just and fair and to assist the Cause, that perchance the idle fancies of the past may not be renewed and people may be freed from the chains of vain imaginings and may regard all save God as utter nothingness. Should the true station of Divine Unity be revealed from the Supreme Pen as it should be, all would become aware of that which they have hitherto been heedless. Verily, He speaketh the truth and guideth the servants to the path of guidance.\n\nThrough the might of princes and the oppression of divines, all remained veiled behind a covering, and when the horizon became somewhat illumined with the light of security and the fire of hatred somewhat abated, they rushed forth to the outlying regions and uttered that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise and the companions of the sacred precincts to lament. This party too hath determined to occupy the helpless people for another thousand and two hundred years with the vain imaginings of deluded souls, and in the end to reap the fruits of the deeds of the former party. By My life! This party hath proved more base than all other parties.\n\nThe people of God must strive and promote the Cause of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. Great is this Day! Blessed are they that have attained, and blessed are they that are firmly established. From this spot We send Our greetings upon your faces and counsel you with that which will exalt you and profit you in all the worlds of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveys his greetings to each of the friends of God and implores the Exalted Truth to grant confirmation and success to all, that perchance these helpless people may not again fall prey to the claws of vain imaginings. They have denied Him Whose station is equal to all the books before and after, which were sent down from the heaven of His bounty, and they have clung to that which was and is unworthy of mention. By the life of our Lord! The barking ones are unaware. What is astonishing is that Ahmad ibn Ja'far was among the followers of Karim Khan, and Karim Khan wrote a book every year refuting the Bab, yet when he entered this Cause, on that very day he fell into the desire for leadership and became occupied with misleading the helpless people. Soon that which is hidden within him shall be revealed. All are witnesses and testify that the Truth alone, unveiled and unobscured, hath been established from the beginning of the Cause, and He hath summoned all the peoples of the world, both kings and subjects, to embrace it. Neither might nor clamor, neither guns nor cannons, neither ranks nor multitudes could prevent Him. Every fair-minded person beareth witness to what hath been mentioned. In brief, all these matters have previously flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the soul whom the breathing of the idolators and the objections of the antagonists have not kept back from the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about his cousin, upon him be the Glory of God, one page was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen and adorned in the handwriting of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and being be offered up for the dust of His footsteps - specifically for him. God willing, they will deliver it to him and he will attain unto it. This evanescent one beseecheth the Exalted Truth to not deprive him of the Kawthar of utterance, to illumine him with the lights of the Sun of certitude, and to preserve him from the darkness of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nAnd regarding what was mentioned about the spiritual matron, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God, her mention hath ever been and continueth to be in the Most Holy Court. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for her. God willing, she will attain unto it and will cause all the handmaidens to be set ablaze with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree of utterance. In truth, from the beginning of the Cause, in days when all the heroes and men of the earth were hidden due to fear and awe of the divines, that leaf, upon her be the Glory of God and His favors, stood firm in the Cause and was engaged in praise and remembrance. Well is it with her and pleasant is it unto her. In the early days she heard from the Tongue of Grandeur \"O My handmaiden and My leaf.\" The passage of Abdullah Ansari was previously before the eyes of that beloved one; from this, to some extent, this station becometh known. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto. Most matters remain concealed. God will soon reveal what He willeth. Verily, He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, and He is the Powerful, the All-Wise.\n\nO handmaid of God! The Object of all horizons is seen beneath the talons of hatred, yet in this hour He makes mention of thee. No thing among all things, and no matter among all matters, hath prevented Him from the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. We have spoken that which We were to speak. Now pray thou and beseech God that His servants and handmaidens may be preserved from the dawning-places of idle fancies and may hold fast to His straight path and His firm cord with such firmness that the peoples of the world shall not prevent them. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the handmaidens of that land and give them the glad tidings of the splendors of the Sun of favor. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO Jamal! Upon thee be My glory! Today the possessors of beauty, perfection, justice and fairness are those souls who have drunk from the ocean of knowledge and been illumined by the rays of the Sun of inner meanings. Should a soul subjugate the whole world and possess all sciences and arts, yet before God he was not and is not mentioned, and in the sight of them that are established upon the thrones of divine knowledge and wisdom, he is as one non-existent and forgotten. But if his sight is illumined by the light of divine vision and knowledge, and he hath drunk from the Kawthar of certitude, he possesseth all things, even though he be unable to read a single word. Blessed are the manifestations of the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory - those souls who soar on the wings of knowledge in this luminous atmosphere. We beseech God to preserve all and deprive them not of this true journey and spiritual wayfaring. Today the wings of most are prevented from flight by the clay of vain imaginings, and the veil of heedlessness hath deprived their eyes from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is he who hath mentioned thee and thee, and those who have held fast to this firm cord and this mighty announcement. Blessed is thy father who, at the time of his ascension, was welcomed by the Concourse on High, who found from him the fragrance of the love of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nO Nuriyyih! Upon thee be the favor of God! According to what was mentioned, Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi wrote two cycles of divine ordinances, yet he attained not unto the Tree of his heart's desire and remained deprived of the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the fruits of all his knowledge and deeds. And Shaykh Murtada, although to some degree he gazed toward the Most Exalted Horizon and traces of love's light were manifest in him, yet he succeeded not in attaining true knowledge. The labors of seventy years were scattered to the winds, and likewise all the other divines of the cities and regions of Iran were deprived. But thou, through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, hast drunk from the cup of divine love and partaken of the ocean of knowledge. By the life of God! Were this station to be revealed and made manifest, the tongues of all the peoples of the world would speak forth \"Blessed be God, the Lord of all worlds!\" Give thanks unto thy Lord for this mighty favor and this manifest grace.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for the son, upon him be the glory of God, exalted be His proof and mighty His utterance: O My friend! The True Friend hath turned towards thee, and this is that friendship whereof He saith \"Your friend is God alone\" unto the end of the verse. This is that friendship for which there hath been and shall be no peer or likeness. It is specially reserved for God, exalted be His glory, even as the Most Great Infallibility hath ever been and shall ever be specially reserved for God - exalted be His station and His Manifestation - Who hath not accepted and will never accept any partner therein. This is one of the hidden mysteries which in this Revelation hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen. Well is it with them that comprehend! Give thanks unto God for that the Lord of all being hath turned towards thee and made mention of thee in such wise as to solace the eyes of them that are nigh unto Him. All praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds. We make mention of thy mother and thy sister, as a command from Our presence, and I am verily the Omnipotent Commander. We beseech God to assist you and strengthen you to remember and praise Him, to hold fast unto His cord and cling to His resplendent hem. Ye have ever been and continue to be remembered, as testified by My tongue, My pen, and My loving-kindness whose fragrance hath been diffused through that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of Mine utterance, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth greetings, salutations and praise to each one, and seeketh for them whatsoever is worthy of the grace and bounty of God, exalted be His glory. Whenever the Sun of loving-kindness shineth upon His friends, or the ocean of grace manifesteth its waves, the spirit of this evanescent one is renewed as though he had quaffed from the ocean of grace and been showered by the rain of mercy. Such joy doth encompass him that its mention would transform the sorrow of the world. His is the praise in all conditions, His the bounty in all conditions, His the generosity in all conditions. Glory be unto God! Man is bewildered, nay all things seen and unseen are bewildered by these people who are as dead in these days when the fire of Manifestation is ablaze, the lamp of loving-kindness is manifest, and the water of life floweth from the Pen that revealeth the verses. All are withered, dead, non-existent and lost. By the life of our Lord and your Lord! This is naught but the recompense of their vile deeds. The Day of Reckoning hath come: that which was hidden hath become manifest, and that which was concealed hath been revealed. The decree belongeth unto our Lord, and all authority is in His grasp, and the reins of all things are in His right hand. The servant testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nMention was made of the sister. After she gained the honor of hearkening, this most exalted and blessed Word was revealed. His word, blessed and exalted is He: O thou who gazest upon the Face! We have heard her call and have answered her with these verses. We beseech God, her Lord, to assist her with His remembrance and praise, to strengthen her in that which beseemeth His days, to draw her nigh unto Him, and to ordain for her from the Supreme Pen that which shall profit her. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Convey My glad-tidings unto her and glorify her countenance, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nGlory be unto God! The spiritual realm hath been disturbed by the whisperings of devils, the insinuations of the infidels, and the schemes of the transgressors.\n\nIn these days the beloved of hearts, His Holiness Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath sent a copy of a letter which Ibn-i-Ja'far-i-Kirmani gave to Aqa Muhammad Big, upon him be the glory and loving-kindness of God, in Sensen. At its head the Most Great Name is mentioned, followed by one of the most exalted Words. Here then is the exact copy of the letter, without any change or alteration:\n\nHe is God, the Glorious, the All-Glorious!\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nThe Most Exalted Pen proclaims: The loved ones of Our sanctified Countenance, who in their longing for the Beloved and the revered Temple of Truth have turned their days into nights and their nights into days, are now mentioned before the Throne, that they may rejoice and be glad with this most exalted honor, this most radiant joy, and this most glorious delight in the highest and lowest kingdoms. O thou Named Nabil! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, then thank the Most High God at morn and eventide, and be thou steadfast in the Cause of God. Remember thy branches and leaves with words of glorification, mention the awestruck lovers before the Countenance of the Divine Unity, and being established in the mysteries of glory and certitude upon your most exalted paths, may ye be remembered in the highest and lowest dominions of might. And glorification be from God.\n\nReflect upon the deception and fraud of the souls of the polytheists. First they write using the Most Great Name so that the recipient might be attracted, and through this stratagem they might tame him and instill that which leads to eternal misguidance. Now one must reflect upon the ocean of deception - they have mixed the words of truth with the whisperings of satan, for though it begins with the Most Great Name - this is from the Truth, says the Most Exalted Pen, and this is what the Truth has spoken, and likewise before the Throne - the rest is attributed to the rebellious one. In any case, say: O party of God! These souls are seen to be exactly like those souls who in early Islam became the cause of error and misguidance. They would run from city to city, making mention of an imaginary Qa'im and recounting miracles, until at last all were wandering for twelve hundred years in the wilderness of error due to the vain imaginings of those souls. These souls too, by the life of our Lord and your Lord, will never attain to the light of faith. They strive and struggle that perchance they might acquire authority like the authorities of the past, and this party has been seen to be the most abased of all parties. May the True One, exalted be His glory, protect His party. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nAs to what was previously written regarding the arrival of divine Tablets wherein the command of dissimulation was revealed - this is true. After the martyrdom of His Holiness Badi' - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - who appeared and shone forth from the horizon of power, the command of wisdom was revealed, such that most Tablets were adorned with this command. And after the martyrdom of His Holiness 'Ali from the land of Mim - upon him be all the most glorious Beauty - the command of non-confession was issued. Glory be to God! Those oppressive, heedless souls wished to utter words contrary to truth, yet they \\[the martyrs\\] refused and sacrificed their lives with the utmost joy and fragrance. At the time of the revelation of the second command, the Tongue of Grandeur would utter words that would melt the hearts and dissolve stones. At one point He said: The Supreme Pen lamenteth and declareth: \"Conceal what ye possess.\" The oppression of the oppressors and the heedlessness of the heedless have reached such a state that the Supreme Pen spoke the words of one of the former Letters: \"Dissimulation is my religion\" et cetera. The purpose was to preserve sacred souls. Consider how many souls sacrificed their lives without concealment, veil or dissimulation. In no age or Dispensation have such examples appeared. They considered the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs - upon him be all the most glorious Beauty - to be the cause of the exaltation and elevation of the religion of the Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. How many sacrificial lambs in this Dispensation hastened to the place of sacrifice with joy and fragrance and did not return alive. Nevertheless, all remain heedless and veiled. The son of Ja'far counted the Beloved of Martyrs, His Honor Aqa Siyyid Isma'il of Zavarih - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - who sacrificed himself by his own hand in Iraq, as one of his own, even though he had never seen aught but truth. The details about that beloved one have been mentioned in some letters, and in the Book of Badi' his mention hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in such wise that none but truth can comprehend it. They have said the people of Baha killed him. It would be most fitting to ask him: \"You were among the dead followers of Karim Khan in those days, and when you claimed to have entered this Cause you were behind a veil. From where do you derive these reports?\" In brief, by the life of Our purpose and your purpose, from the beginning of the world until now, no liars like these souls have ever been seen or heard. To this every fair-minded and insightful one beareth witness.\n\nIn His Name, the Wronged One, the Imprisoned!\n\nConcerning what was written about fasting, the divine ordinances have not changed - the Kitab-i-Aqdas exists. In this land, the friends with utmost boldness abandoned the Ramadan fast, to such an extent that the entire population became aware of it, and there was fear that the wicked would suddenly rise up. Therefore, a special Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Lord of Lords' will, addressed to one of the friends, commanding that in this land they should observe the Ramadan fast. This ruling is specific to this land. However, the decree of wisdom has ever been revealed and all must hold fast to it and cling to it. These recent matters have been the cause of the oppression of oppressors and the transgressions of transgressors. The Sunnis will soon turn to the Cause, as they do not harbor previous delusions and say the Promised One must be born, as some have already turned. However, before entering the ocean of faith they are very fanatical, as they definitely consider the Persians to be infidels. In any case, we beseech and hope that the Truth may guide all. Their entry into this ocean also carried risk of corruption, for after entering they would become so enkindled that concealment would be lost. Therefore, teaching in this land and its surroundings has been forbidden. However, the friends of Truth in those lands must be mindful of wisdom and engage in teaching with utmost effort. Blessings be upon those who hear the Word and act according to what is commanded in the Book of God, Lord of the worlds.\n\nRegarding what was written about the details of the Most Great Festival and acting according to wisdom's requirements, after being presented, He - exalted be He - spoke: \"Excellent is what you have done in the path of God, Lord of the worlds. We have heard your mention and what issued from your lips in praise of your Lord, and We have accepted what you have done purely for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Great. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to draw you near to Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Protector of those drawn near. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.\"\n\nAs for the days of the Most Great Festival, the afternoon of the thirty-second day after Naw-Ruz is the first day of the Festival, and the afternoon of the forty-third is its end, making twelve days. The first and last days are reckoned as two days with God. Would that this servant could find opportunity to mention to you the mysteries of these days and what God's Books, both past and future, have uttered concerning them. Praise be to God that those beloved ones are assisted in remembrance, praise and service to the Cause. On the thirty-second day which is the first day of the Festival, as well as the ninth day and the forty-third day which is the final day, work and occupation are forbidden. All must engage in associating with friends in a spirit of joy and fellowship and in establishing love in hearts.\n\nMention was made of His Honor Aqa Mirza 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. After being presented before the Divine Presence, the Supreme Pen spoke that which caused the realities of all things to be attracted. He - exalted be He - spoke:\n\nIn My Name, the Wronged One, the Imprisoned \\[...\\]\n\nO Ali! By God, the Path calls out, yet the people hear not. The Balance summons all within the realm of possibility, yet they understand not. The Hour has come with its tokens, and the Resurrection with its mysteries, yet the people know not. All who dwell in earth and heaven were thunderstruck when the shrill voice of My Most Exalted Pen was raised, yet most of the people perceive not. Their desires have prevented them from turning to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. They worship idols by night and day, save those whom God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, has strengthened. Thus have We sent down the verses and revealed what was hidden in God's knowledge, the Possessor of the Unseen and the Seen. Your mention hath been made before the Wronged One, and this irrevocable Book hath been sent down unto thee that thou mayest read it and thank thy Lord, the Protector, the Mighty, the Loving. Hold fast to the cord of steadfastness and speak forth in praise of God, the Lord of creation. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have not been kept back by desire from the Lord of all mankind - verily they are among the people of this praiseworthy station.\n\nThe mention of Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and a Tablet hath been specifically sent to him. God willing, may he be adorned with steadfastness and illumined with the light of certitude. The mention of the nephews, and likewise the Fast of the Luminous Leaf, and the mention of Qurratu'l-'Ayn Mir-Vali, upon them be the Glory of God - all were presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court, and were honored with acceptance, each being distinguished by God's wondrous and glorious favors. Blessed are they and joy be unto them.\n\nThy other letter, which was truly a garden adorned with the roses of spirit and sweet basil, and the anemones of realities and flowers of knowledge, was indeed a delightful sight to behold and a wondrous fragrance for the spiritual sense to perceive. After its reading, recitation, observation and review, it ascended on the wings of attention to the Station until it was presented before the face of the Lord of all mankind. After it gained the honor of being heard, these exalted words descended from the heaven of the favors of the Lord of Names and Attributes. His word, exalted be His majesty and abundant be His favors:\n\nO thou who gazeth upon the Face! There hath come upon Us what hath come upon no other among the servants. The learned sit while Truth standeth; the learned are silent while Truth speaketh; the learned sleep while Truth is awake; the learned fear while Truth is serene; the learned waver while Truth is steadfast. In the days when the idolatrous souls among the people of the Bayan were occupied with play behind the veil, this Wronged One was calling out before all faces with the most exalted call - a call that all in the world, both rulers and ruled, heard, except for certain minor kings whose mention hath not specifically flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. In those days, neither speaker was visible nor anyone standing forth. Now one like Ja'far hath come forth to make display. By God's life, they are in manifest error. We beseech God to assist His servants unto justice and fairness, and to enable them to hearken unto His call which hath been raised between earth and heaven. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My friends and loved ones who have not been kept back by the veils of the world from turning unto God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd concerning what the aforementioned Ja'far hath mentioned about alteration - for some time the deniers of the Bayan have been speaking this word, saying the Bayan has been altered and the true Bayan is not available. Their purpose is to occupy people with former vain imaginings. Lo! The curse of God be upon those who imagine vainly, the infidels, and the transgressors.\n\nIn reference to the mention of Haji Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, we continually beseech the Most High, exalted be His glory, for his success. I am writing and sending a reply to his letter which, God willing, will reach him. And likewise regarding the mention of Karbila'i 'Abbas-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, after presentation before the Divine Presence, these sublime words were revealed, He says, glorified be His majesty:\n\n\"O 'Abbas-'Ali! Vain imaginings have deprived the world from the Lord of all beings, for even the blessed word 'There is no God but God', which is the word of unity, has until now remained veiled. Indeed, great is this Cause - in the Qur'an it was referred to as the 'Great Announcement'. Most great it is, yet should a soul become illumined with the light of unity, he would see all else but God as non-existent and count it as nothingness, and would regard himself as transcending all the peoples of the world. Names would no longer hold him back from reality and meaning. The ranks and multitudes of nations and the might of the world would not prevent the men of this field from turning towards Him, and the diverse winds would not move the trees of this garden. We beseech God to give His friends to drink from this cup. By the life of God, the oceans of the world are as a drop before Him, now and forever. Blessed are they that attain, and blessed are they that know.\"\n\nPraise be to God, the rays of the Sun of divine favor have encompassed the world. Blessed are those souls who have recognized the value of God's days and become illumined by its lights.\n\nRegarding what was written about the property, that it should be transferred to whomever is commanded, after presentation in the Most Holy Court, this exalted word shone forth from the highest horizon, blessed and exalted be He: \"We have accepted what thou didst intend in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds.\" Indeed, that honored one has been and is successful. We have accepted what he intended and entrusted it to him. As a mention from Us: \"Thou hast fulfilled God's covenant and His pledge, and hast been steadfast in serving His mighty and great Cause.\"\n\nThat beloved one has, praise be to God, been successful in turning towards God, serving, and fulfilling rights both past and present, and has likewise been honored with acceptance. His is the praise in all conditions, His is the favor in all conditions, and His is the grace in all conditions.\n\nRegarding what was written about sending leaves, what was sent has arrived, and most of what clothes the blessed body is also leaves. The servant asks his Lord to send down upon His loved ones from the heaven of His gifts that which will illumine hearts and minds in His mighty and beloved Day, and I ask Him to draw them near to Him in all conditions. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nThis evanescent one conveys greetings and glorification to each of the friends of God, and beseeches God to assist all to be steadfast in service and in His remembrance and praise. He is the Hearer, the All-Seeing. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious.\n\nPeace, praise, glory and splendor be upon you, upon those with you, and upon those who have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in this manifest Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of Names, Creator of the heavens, and Lord of this wondrous Day.\n\nThe Servant\n\n23rd of Rajab 1303\n\nThe divine friends in Faran have sought permission to come. Permission is granted and favor is manifest. Convey to them the glad tidings of permission. Another point is that whoever in those regions becomes enabled to pay the Huququ'llah, it should be given to the honored Leaf of Paradise, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and if anything remains afterward, it should be sent.\n\nSix exalted and impenetrable Tablets were sent; following their perusal, deliver them.\n\n=== END BH00037 ===\n\n=== START BH00038 ===\n\nO King of the Earth! Hearken unto the call of this Vassal: Verily, I am a Servant Who hath believed in God and in His signs, and have sacrificed Myself in His path. Unto this bear witness the woes which now beset Me, woes the like of which no man hath ever before sustained. My Lord, the All-Knowing, testifieth to the truth of My words. I have summoned the people unto none save God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, and have endured for love of Him such afflictions as the eye of creation hath never beheld. To this testify those whom the veils of human fancy have not deterred from turning unto the Most Sublime Vision, and, beyond them, He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in the preserved Tablet.\n\nWhensoever the clouds of tribulation have rained down the darts of affliction in the path of God, the Lord of all names, I have hastened to meet them, as every fair-minded and discerning soul shall attest. How many the nights which found the beasts of the field resting in their lairs, and the birds of the air lying in their nests, while this Youth languished in chains and fetters with none to aid or succour Him!\n\nCall Thou to mind God's mercy unto Thee; how, when Thou wert imprisoned with a number of other souls, He delivered Thee and aided Thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, until the King sent Thee to 'Iraq after We had disclosed unto him that Thou wert not of the sowers of sedition. Those who follow their corrupt desires and lay aside the fear of God are indeed in grievous error. They that spread disorder in the land, shed the blood of men, and wrongfully consume the substance of others--We, verily, are clear of them, and We beseech God not to associate Us with them, whether in this world or in the world to come, unless they should repent unto Him. He, verily, is of those who show mercy the most merciful.\n\nWhoso turneth towards God must distinguish himself from others by his every deed, and follow that which hath been enjoined upon him in the Book. Thus hath it been decreed in a lucid Tablet. Those, however, who cast behind their backs the commandments of God, and follow the prompting of their own desires, are, verily, in grievous error.\n\nO King! I adjure thee by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, to look upon thy servants with the glances of the eye of thy favour, and to treat them with justice, that God may treat thee with mercy. Potent is thy Lord to do as He pleaseth. The world, with all its abasement and glory, shall pass away, and the kingdom will remain unto God, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.\n\nSay: He hath kindled the lamp of utterance, and feedeth it with the oil of wisdom and understanding. Too high is thy Lord, the All-Merciful, for aught in the universe to resist His Faith. He revealeth what He pleaseth through the power of His sovereign might, and protecteth it with a host of His well-favoured angels. He is supreme over His servants and exerciseth undisputed dominion over His creation. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current amongst men I studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt, that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them who speak falsely. This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! They move it as they list. The evanescent is as nothing before Him Who is the Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling summons hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all people. I was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered. The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful, transformed Me. Can anyone speak forth of his own accord that for which all men, both high and low, will protest against him? Nay, by Him Who taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the grace of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath strengthened.\n\nThe Pen of the Most High addresseth Me, saying: Fear not. Relate unto His Majesty the Shah that which befell thee. His heart, verily, is between the fingers of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his heart. Thus hath the decree been sent down by Him Who is the All-Wise.\n\nLook upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou, then, with truth concerning what hath befallen Him. Of a verity, God hath made thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell on earth. Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged Us without proof and without an enlightening Book. They that surround thee love thee for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own sake, and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace, and to turn thee toward the right hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth witness unto that which I declare.\n\nO King! Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the Pen of Glory and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity which, on the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the Maker of all names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever might desire it, and setting thy face toward the Horizon aglow with the light of His countenance. Neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High. Then would the Concourse on high bless thee. O how excellent is this most sublime station, couldst thou ascend thereunto through the power of a sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of God!\n\nAmongst the people are those who allege that this Youth hath had no purpose but to perpetuate His name, whilst others claim that He hath sought for Himself the vanities of the world--this, notwithstanding that never, throughout all My days, have I found a place of safety, be it to the extent of a single foothold. At all times have I been immersed in an ocean of tribulations, whose full measure none can fathom but God. He, truly, is aware of what I say. How many the days in which My loved ones have been sorely shaken by reason of My afflictions, and how many the nights during which My kindred, fearing for My life, have bitterly wept and lamented! And this none can deny save them that are bereft of truthfulness. Is it conceivable that He Who expecteth to lose His life at any moment should seek after worldly vanities? How very strange the imaginings of those who speak as prompted by their own caprices, and who wander distractedly in the wilderness of self and passion! Erelong shall they be called upon to account for their words, and on that day they shall find none to befriend or help them.\n\nAnd amongst the people are those who claim that He hath disbelieved in God--yet every member of My body testifieth that there is none other God but Him; that those Whom He hath raised up in truth and sent forth with His guidance are the Manifestations of His most excellent names, the Revealers of His most exalted attributes, and the Repositories of His Revelation in the kingdom of creation; that through them the Proof of God hath been perfected unto all else but Him, the standard of Divine Unity hath been raised, and the sign of sanctity hath been made manifest; and that through them every soul hath found a path unto the Lord of the Throne on high. We testify that there is none other God but Him, that from everlasting He was alone with none else besides Him, and that He shall be unto everlasting what He hath ever been. Too high is the All-Merciful for the hearts of those who have recognized Him to apprehend His true nature, or for the minds of men to hope to fathom His essence. He verily is exalted above the understanding of anyone besides Himself, and sanctified beyond the comprehension of all else save Him. From all eternity He hath been independent of the entire creation.\n\nRemember the days in which the Sun of Ba??a shone forth above the horizon of the Will of thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High, and recall how the divines of that age turned away from Him, and the learned contended with Him, that haply thou mayest apprehend that which, in this day, remaineth concealed behind the veils of glory. So grievous became His plight on every side that He instructed His companions to disperse. Thus was the decree sent down from the heaven of divine glory. Remember, furthermore, how, when one of these same companions came before the King of Ethiopia and recited unto him a Surih of the Qur'an, he declared to his attendants: \"This, truly, hath been revealed by One Who is All-Knowing and All-Wise. Whoso acknowledgeth the truth, and believeth in the teachings of Jesus, can in no wise deny what hath been recited. We, verily, bear witness to its truth, even as we bear witness to the truth of that which we possess of the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nI swear by God, O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear to the melodies of that Nightingale which warbleth in manifold accents upon the mystic bough as bidden by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst cast away thy sovereignty and set thy face towards this Scene of transcendent glory, this station above whose horizon shineth the Book of the Dawntide, and wouldst expend all that thou possessest in thine eagerness to obtain the things of God. Then wouldst thou find thyself raised up to the summit of exaltation and glory, and elevated to the pinnacle of majesty and independence. Thus hath the decree been recorded in the Mother Book by the Pen of the All-Merciful. Of what avail are the things which are yours today and which tomorrow others shall possess? Choose for thyself that which God hath chosen for His elect, and God shall grant thee a mighty sovereignty in His Kingdom. We beseech God to aid thy Majesty to hearken unto that Word whose radiance hath enveloped the whole world, and to protect thee from such as have strayed far from the court of His presence.\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Lord My God! How many the heads which were raised aloft on spears in Thy path, and how many the breasts which were made the target of arrows for the sake of Thy good pleasure! How many the hearts that have been lacerated for the exaltation of Thy Word and the promotion of Thy Cause, and how many the eyes that have wept sore for love of Thee! I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the King of kings and the Pitier of the downtrodden, by Thy Most Great Name which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy most excellent names and the Dayspring of Thy most exalted attributes, to remove the veils that have come in between Thee and Thy creatures and debarred them from turning unto the horizon of Thy Revelation. Cause them, then, O My God, by Thy most exalted Word, to turn from the left hand of oblivion and delusion unto the right hand of knowledge and certitude, that they may know what Thou hast purposed for them through Thy bounty and grace, and may set their faces towards Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Revealer of Thy signs.\n\nO My God! Thou art the All-Bountiful, Whose grace is infinite. Withhold not Thy servants from the most mighty Ocean, which Thou hast made the repository of the pearls of Thy knowledge and Thy wisdom, and turn them not away from Thy gate, which Thou hast opened wide before all who are in Thy heaven and all who are on Thy earth. O Lord! Leave them not to themselves, for they understand not and flee from that which is better for them than all that Thou hast created upon Thine earth. Cast upon them, O My God, the glances of the eye of Thy favour and bounty, and deliver them from self and passion, that they may draw nigh unto Thy most exalted Horizon, taste the sweetness of Thy remembrance, and delight in that bread which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the firmament of Thy grace. From everlasting Thy bounty hath embraced the entire creation and Thy mercy hath surpassed all things. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord My God! Thou well knowest that Mine heart hath melted in Thy Cause, and that My blood so boileth in My veins with the fire of Thy love that every drop of it proclaimeth with its inner tongue: \"Grant that I may be spilt upon the ground for Thy sake, O my Lord, the Most High, that from it there may spring forth that which Thou hast purposed in Thy Tablets and hast hidden from the eyes of all, except such servants as have tasted of the crystal stream of knowledge from the hands of Thy grace and quaffed the soft-flowing waters of understanding from the cup of Thy bestowal.\"\n\nThou knowest, O My God, that in all Mine affairs I have sought only to obey Thy bidding, that in Mine every utterance I have wished only to extol Thy praise, and that in whatsoever hath proceeded from My Pen I have purposed only to win Thy good pleasure and to reveal that which Thou hast enjoined upon Me through Thy sovereignty.\n\nThou beholdest Me, O My God, as one bewildered in Thy land. Whensoever I make mention of that which Thou hast enjoined upon Me, Thy creatures cavil at Me; yet were I to neglect that which Thou hast bidden Me observe, I would deserve the scourge of Thine anger and would be far removed from the meadows of Thy nearness. Nay, by Thy glory! I have set My face towards Thy good pleasure, and turned away from the things whereon Thy servants have set their affections. I have embraced all that is with Thee, and forsaken all that might lead Me away from the retreats of Thy nearness and the heights of Thy glory. I swear by Thy might! With Thy love in My heart nothing can ever alarm Me, and in the path of Thy good pleasure all the world's afflictions can in no wise dismay Me. All this, however, proceedeth from Thy power and Thy might, from Thy bounty and Thy grace, and is not of Mine own deserving.\n\nThis is an Epistle, O My God, which I have purposed to send unto the King. Thou knowest that I have wished of him naught but that he should show forth justice to Thy servants and extend his favours unto the people of Thy kingdom. For Myself I have desired only what Thou didst desire, and through Thy succour I wish for naught save that which Thou wishest. Perish the soul that seeketh from Thee aught save Thyself! I swear by Thy glory! Thy good pleasure is my dearest wish, and Thy purpose My highest hope. Have mercy, O My God, upon this poor creature Who hath clung unto the hem of Thy riches, and this suppliant soul Who calleth upon Thee, saying, \"Thou art, verily, the Lord of might and glory!\" Assist Thou, O My God, His Majesty the Shah to keep Thy statutes amidst Thy servants and to manifest Thy justice amongst Thy creatures, that he may treat this people as he treateth others. Thou art, in truth, the God of power, of glory and wisdom.\n\nBy the leave and permission of the King of the Age, this Servant journeyed from the Seat of Sovereignty to 'Iraq, and dwelt for twelve years in that land. Throughout the entire course of this period no account of Our condition was submitted to the court of thy presence, and no representation ever made to foreign powers. Placing Our whole trust in God, We resided in that land until there came to 'Iraq a certain official who, upon his arrival, undertook to harass this poor company of exiles. Day after day, at the instigation of some of the outwardly learned and of other individuals, he would stir up trouble for these servants, although they had at no time committed any act detrimental to the state and its people or contrary to the rules and customs of the citizens of the realm.\n\nFearing lest the actions of these transgressors should produce some outcome at variance with thy world-adorning judgement, this Servant despatched a brief account of the matter to Mirza Sa'id Khan at the Foreign Ministry, so that he might submit it to the royal presence and that whatever thou shouldst please to decree in this respect might be obeyed. A long while elapsed, and no decree was issued. Finally matters came to such a pass that there loomed the threat of imminent strife and bloodshed. Of necessity, therefore, and for the protection of the servants of God, a few of them appealed to the Governor of 'Iraq.\n\nWert thou to observe these events with the eye of fairness, it would become clear and evident in the luminous mirror of thine heart that what occurred was called for by the circumstances, and that no other alternative could be seen. His Majesty himself is witness that in whatever city a number of this people have resided, the hostility of certain functionaries hath enkindled the flame of conflict and contention. This evanescent Soul, however, hath, since His arrival in 'Iraq, forbidden all to engage in dissension and strife. The witness of this Servant is His very deeds, for all are well aware and will testify that, although a greater number of this people resided in 'Iraq than in any other land, no one overstepped his limits or transgressed against his neighbour. Fixing their gaze upon God, and reposing their trust in Him, all have now been abiding in peace for well-nigh fifteen years, and, in whatever hath befallen them, they have shown forth patience and resigned themselves to God.\n\nAfter the arrival of this Servant in this, the city of Adrianople, some of the people of 'Iraq and elsewhere inquired about the meaning of the term \"rendering assistance unto God\" which hath been mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. Several answers were sent out in reply, one of which is set forth in these pages, that it may be clearly demonstrated in the court of thy presence that this Servant hath had no end in view but to promote the betterment and well-being of the world. And if certain of the divine favours which, undeserving as I may be, God hath pleased to bestow upon Me be not plain and manifest, this much at least will be clear and apparent, that He, in His surpassing mercy and infinite grace, hath not deprived Mine heart of the ornament of reason. The passage that was referred to concerning the meaning of \"rendering assistance unto God\" is as follows:\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory!\n\nIt is clear and evident that the one true God--glorified be His mention!--is sanctified above the world and all that is therein. By \"rendering assistance unto God\", then, it is not meant that any soul should fight or contend with another. That Sovereign Lord Who doeth whatsoever He pleaseth hath entrusted the kingdom of creation, its lands and its seas, into the hands of the kings, for they are, each according to his degree, the manifestations of His divine power. Should they enter beneath the shadow of the True One, they will be accounted of God, and if not, thy Lord, verily, knoweth and observeth all things.\n\nThat which God--glorified be His Name!--hath desired for Himself is the hearts of His servants, which are the treasuries of His love and remembrance and the repositories of His knowledge and wisdom. It hath ever been the wish of the Eternal King to cleanse the hearts of His servants from the things of the world and all that pertaineth thereunto, that they may be made worthy recipients of the effulgent splendours of Him Who is the King of all names and attributes. Wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the city of the heart, that the incomparable Friend may enter His abode. By this is meant the effulgence of His names and attributes, and not His exalted Essence, inasmuch as that peerless King hath ever been, and shall eternally remain, sanctified above ascent and descent.\n\nIt followeth, therefore, that rendering assistance unto God, in this day, doth not and shall never consist in contending or disputing with any soul; nay rather, what is preferable in the sight of God is that the cities of men's hearts, which are ruled by the hosts of self and passion, should be subdued by the sword of utterance, of wisdom and of understanding. Thus, whoso seeketh to assist God must, before all else, conquer, with the sword of inner meaning and explanation, the city of his own heart and guard it from the remembrance of all save God, and only then set out to subdue the cities of the hearts of others.\n\nSuch is the true meaning of rendering assistance unto God. Sedition hath never been pleasing unto God, nor were the acts committed in the past by certain foolish ones acceptable in His sight. Know ye that to be killed in the path of His good pleasure is better for you than to kill. The beloved of the Lord must, in this day, behave in such wise amidst His servants that they may by their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of the All-Glorious.\n\nBy Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of Sanctity! The friends of God have not, nor will they ever, set their hopes upon the world and its ephemeral possessions. The one true God hath ever regarded the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive possession--and this too but as an expression of His all-surpassing mercy, that haply mortal souls may be purged and sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world of dust and gain admittance into the realms of eternity. For otherwise that ideal King is, in Himself and by Himself, sufficient unto Himself and independent of all things. Neither doth the love of His creatures profit Him, nor can their malice harm Him. All have issued forth from abodes of dust, and unto dust shall they return, while the one true God, alone and single, is established upon His Throne, a Throne which is beyond the reaches of time and space, is sanctified above all utterance or expression, intimation, description and definition, and is exalted beyond all notion of abasement and glory. And none knoweth this save Him and those with whom is the knowledge of the Book. No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nIt behoveth the benevolence of the Sovereign, however, to examine all matters with the eye of justice and mercy, and not to content himself with the baseless claims of certain individuals. We beseech God to graciously assist the King to fulfil that which He pleaseth, and, verily, that which He desireth should be the desire of all the worlds.\n\nLater this Servant was summoned to Constantinople, whither We arrived accompanied by a poor band of exiles. At no time thereafter did We seek to meet with anyone, as We had no request to make and no aim in view but to demonstrate unto all that this Servant had no mischief in mind and had never associated with the sowers of sedition. By Him Who hath caused the tongues of all beings to speak forth His praise! While certain considerations rendered it difficult to make application to any quarter, such steps were perforce taken to protect certain souls. My Lord, verily, knoweth what is in Me, and He beareth witness unto the truth of what I say.\n\nA just king is the shadow of God on earth. All should seek shelter under the shadow of his justice, and rest in the shade of his favour. This is not a matter which is either specific or limited in its scope, that it might be restricted to one or another person, inasmuch as the shadow telleth of the One Who casteth it. God, glorified be His remembrance, hath called Himself the Lord of the worlds, for He hath nurtured and still nurtureth everyone. Glorified be, then, His grace that hath preceded all created things, and His mercy that hath surpassed the worlds.\n\nIt is clear and evident that, whether this Cause be seen as right or wrong by the people, those who are associated with its name have accepted and embraced it as true, and have forsaken their all in their eagerness to partake of the things of God. That they should evince such renunciation in the path of the love of the All-Merciful is in itself a faithful witness and an eloquent testimony to the truth of their convictions. Hath it ever been witnessed that a man of sound judgement should sacrifice his life without cause or reason? And if it be suggested that this people have taken leave of their senses, this too is highly improbable, inasmuch as such behaviour hath not been confined to merely a soul or two--nay, a vast multitude of every class have drunk their fill of the living waters of divine knowledge, and, intoxicated, have hastened with heart and soul to the field of sacrifice in the way of the Beloved.\n\nIf these souls, who have renounced all else but God for His sake and offered up their life and substance in His path, are to be accounted as false, then by what proof and testimony can the truth of what others assert be established in thy presence? The late Haji Siyyid Muhammad--may God exalt his station and immerse him in the ocean of His forgiveness and mercy!--was one of the most learned divines of his age, and one of the most devout and pious men of his time. So highly was he regarded that his praise was on every tongue, and his righteousness and piety were universally acknowledged. Yet, when hostilities broke out with Russia, he who himself had pronounced the decree of holy war, and who with blazoned standard had left his native land to rally to the support of his faith, abandoned, after the inconvenience of a brief encounter, all the good that he had purposed, and returned whence he had come. Would that the veil might be lifted, and that which hath ere now remained hidden from the eyes of men be made manifest!\n\nFor more than twenty years this people have, day and night, been subjected to the fury of the Sovereign's wrath, and have been scattered by the tempestuous gales of his displeasure, each to a different land. How many the children who have been left fatherless, and how many the fathers who have lost their sons! How many the mothers who have dared not, out of fear and dread, to mourn their slaughtered offspring! How numerous those who, at eventide, were possessed of utmost wealth and affluence, and who, when morning came, had fallen into utter abasement and destitution! No land is there whose soil hath not been tinged with their blood, nor reach of heaven unto which their sighs have not ascended. Throughout the years the darts of affliction have unceasingly rained down from the clouds of God's decree, yet despite all these calamities and tribulations, the flame of divine love hath so blazed in their hearts that even should their bodies be torn asunder they would not forsake their love of Him Who is the Best-Beloved of the worlds, but would welcome with heart and soul whatever might befall them in the path of God.\n\nO King! The breezes of the grace of the All-Merciful have transformed these servants and attracted them unto His Holy Court. \"The witness of a true lover is upon his sleeve.\" Nevertheless, some of the outwardly learned have troubled the luminous heart of the King of the Age concerning these souls who revolve round the Tabernacle of the All-Merciful and who seek to attain the Sanctuary of true knowledge. Would that the world-adorning wish of His Majesty might decree that this Servant be brought face to face with the divines of the age, and produce proofs and testimonies in the presence of His Majesty the Shah! This Servant is ready, and taketh hope in God, that such a gathering may be convened in order that the truth of the matter may be made clear and manifest before His Majesty the Shah. It is then for thee to command, and I stand ready before the throne of thy sovereignty. Decide, then, for Me or against Me.\n\nThe All-Merciful saith in the Qur'an, His abiding testimony unto all the peoples of the world: \"Wish ye then for death, if ye be men of truth.\" Behold how He hath declared the yearning for death to be the touchstone of sincerity! And, in the luminous mirror of thy judgement, it is doubtless clear and evident which people have chosen, in this day, to lay down their lives in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. Indeed, were the books supporting the beliefs of this people to be written with the blood spilled in the path of God--exalted be His glory!--then countless volumes would have already appeared amongst men for all to see.\n\nHow, We fain would ask, is it possible to impugn this people whose deeds are in conformity with their words, and to give credence instead to those who have refused to relinquish one jot of their worldly authority in the path of Him Who is the Unconstrained? Some of the divines who have declared this Servant an infidel have at no time met with Me. Never having seen Me, or become acquainted with My purpose, they have nevertheless spoken as they pleased and acted as they desired. Yet every claim requireth a proof, not mere words and displays of outward piety.\n\nIn this connection the text of several passages from the Hidden Book of Fatimih--the blessings of God be upon her!--which are relevant to the present theme will be cited in the Persian tongue, that certain matters which have ere now been hidden may be revealed before thy presence. The people addressed in the aforementioned Book, which is today known as the Hidden Words, are those who, though outwardly known for learning and piety, are inwardly the slaves of self and passion.\n\nHe saith: O ye that are foolish, yet have a name to be wise! Wherefore do ye wear the guise of the shepherd, when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent upon My flock? Ye are even as the star, which riseth ere the dawn, and which, though it seem radiant and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of My city astray into the paths of perdition.\n\nAnd likewise He saith: O ye seeming fair yet inwardly foul! Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the Divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sunbeam falls alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference!\n\nAnd also He saith: O essence of desire! At many a dawn have I turned from the realms of the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned to the realms of celestial glory, and breathed it not in My retreats above unto the hosts of holiness.\n\nAnd again He saith: O bondslave of the world! Many a dawn hath the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it came.\n\nTherefore, in the exercise of the royal justice, it is not sufficient to give ear to the claimant alone. God saith in the Qur'an, the unerring Balance that distinguisheth truth from falsehood: \"O ye who believe! If a wicked man come to you with news, clear it up at once, lest through ignorance ye harm others, and afterward repent of what ye have done.\" The holy Traditions, moreover, contain the admonition: \"Believe not the tale-bearer.\" Certain of the divines, who have never seen Us, have misconceived the nature of Our Cause. Those, however, who have met Us will testify that this Servant hath not spoken save in accordance with that which God hath commanded in the Book, and that He hath called attention to the following blessed verse--exalted be His Word: \"Do ye not disavow us only because we believe in God and in what He hath sent down unto us, and in what He had sent down aforetime?\"\n\nO King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and fixed upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that these tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy, and these dire adversities will be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty the Shah will himself examine these matters and bring hope to the hearts. That which We have submitted to thy Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. And God, verily, is a sufficient witness unto Me.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Lord My God! I bear witness that the heart of the King is in truth between the fingers of Thy might. If it be Thy wish, do Thou incline it, O My God, in the direction of charity and mercy. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Bountiful. No God is there besides Thee, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all.\n\nConcerning the prerequisites of the learned, He saith: \"Whoso among the learned guardeth his self, defendeth his faith, opposeth his desires, and obeyeth his Lord's command, it is incumbent upon the generality of the people to pattern themselves after him....\" Should the King of the Age reflect upon this utterance which hath streamed from the tongue of Him Who is the Dayspring of the Revelation of the All-Merciful, he would perceive that those who have been adorned with the attributes enumerated in this holy Tradition are scarcer than the philosopher's stone; wherefore not every man that layeth claim to knowledge deserveth to be believed.\n\nAgain concerning the divines of the Latter Days, He saith: \"The religious doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow of heaven. Out of them hath mischief proceeded, and unto them it shall return.\" And again He saith: \"When the Standard of Truth is made manifest, the people of both the East and the West curse it.\" Should anyone dispute these Traditions, this Servant will undertake to establish their validity, since the details of their transmission have been omitted here for the sake of brevity.\n\nThose doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation have never interfered with this Servant. Thus, for example, Shaykh Murta?a--may God exalt his station and cause him to repose beneath the canopy of His grace!--showed forth kindness during Our sojourn in 'Iraq, and never spoke of this Cause otherwise than as God hath given leave. We beseech God to graciously assist all to do His will and pleasure.\n\nNow, however, all have lost sight of every other consideration, and are bent upon the persecution of this people. Thus, if it be inquired of certain persons who, by the grace of their Lord, repose beneath the shadow of thy royal mercy and enjoy countless favours, \"What service have ye rendered in return for these royal favours? Have ye through wise policy annexed a further territory to the realm? Have ye applied yourselves to aught that would secure the welfare of the people, the prosperity of the kingdom, and the lasting glory of the state?\", they will have no other reply than to designate, justly or falsely, a group of people before thy royal presence as Babis, and forthwith to engage in massacre and pillage. In Tabriz, for instance, and in the Egyptian town of Man?uriyyih, a number of this people were ransomed and large sums were seized, yet no account of these matters was ever made in the court of thy presence.\n\nThe reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their persecutors, finding these unfortunate ones without protection, have forgone more weighty matters and occupied themselves instead with harassing this afflicted people. Numerous confessions and divers creeds abide peacefully beneath the shadow of thy sovereignty. Let this people be also numbered with them. Nay, those who serve the King should be animated by such lofty aims and sublime intentions as to continually strive to bring all religions beneath the shelter of his shadow, and to rule over them with perfect justice.\n\nTo enforce the laws of God is naught but justice, and is the source of universal content. Nay more, the divine statutes have always been, and will ever remain, the cause and instrument of the preservation of mankind, as witnessed by His exalted words: \"In punishment will ye find life, O men of insight!\" It would, however, ill beseem the justice of thy Majesty that for the trespass of a single soul a whole group of people should be subjected to the scourge of thy wrath. The one true God--glorified be His Name!--hath said: \"None shall bear the burden of another.\" It is clear and evident that in every community there have been, and will ever be, the learned and the ignorant, the wise and the heedless, the profligate and the pious. That a wise and reflecting soul should commit a heinous deed is most improbable, inasmuch as such a person either seeketh after this world or hath forsaken it: If he be of the latter, he would assuredly have no regard for aught else besides God, and moreover the fear of God would deter him from unlawful and reprehensible actions; and if he be of the former, he would just as assuredly avoid such deeds as would alienate and alarm the people, and act in such a manner as to earn their confidence and trust. It is therefore evident that reprehensible actions have always emanated, and will ever emanate, from ignorant and foolish souls. We implore God to guard His servants from turning to anyone save Him, and to draw them nigh unto His presence. His might, in truth, is equal to all things.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord My God! Thou hearest the voice of My lamentation, and beholdest My condition, My distress and affliction! Thou knowest all that is in Me. If the call I have raised be wholly for Thy sake, then draw thereby the hearts of Thy creatures towards the heaven of Thy knowledge, and the heart of the Sovereign towards the right hand of the throne of Thy name, the All-Merciful. Supply him then, O My God, with a portion of that goodly sustenance which hath descended from the heaven of Thy generosity and the clouds of Thy mercy, that he may forsake his all and turn unto the court of Thy favour. Aid him, O My God, to assist Thy Cause and to exalt Thy Word amidst Thy creatures. Strengthen him, then, with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, that he may subdue every city in Thy Name, and hold sway, through Thy sovereignty and might, over all that dwell on earth, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of creation! Thou, verily, art the Supreme Ordainer in both the beginning and the end. No God is there but Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.\n\nSo grossly hath Our Cause been misrepresented before thy royal presence that, if some unseemly act be committed by but one of this people, it is portrayed as being prompted by their beliefs. By Him besides Whom there is none other God! This Servant hath refused even to sanction the commission of reproved actions, how much less those which have been explicitly prohibited in the Book of God.\n\nGod hath forbidden unto men the drinking of wine, and this prohibition hath been revealed and recorded in His Book. In spite of this, and of the fact that the learned doctors of the age--may God increase their numbers!--have all prohibited the people from such a wretched act, there still remain some who commit it. The punishment which this act entaileth, however, applieth only to its heedless perpetrators, whilst those noble manifestations of supreme sanctity remain exalted above and exempt from all blame. Yea, the whole creation, both seen and unseen, beareth witness unto their holiness.\n\nYea, these servants regard the one true God as He Who \"doeth as He willeth\" and \"ordaineth as He pleaseth\". Thus they view not as impossible the continued appearance in the contingent world of the Manifestations of His Unity. Should anyone hold otherwise, how would he be different from those who believe the hand of God to be \"chained up\"? And if the one true God--glorified be His mention!--be indeed regarded as unconstrained, then whatever Cause that Ancient King may please to manifest from the wellspring of His Command must be embraced by all. No refuge is there for anyone and no haven to hasten unto save God; no protection is there for any soul and no shelter to seek except in Him.\n\nThe essential requirement for whoso advanceth a claim is to support his assertions with clear proofs and testimonies. Beyond this, the rejection of the people, whether learned or ignorant, hath never been, nor shall it ever be, of any consequence. The Prophets of God, those Pearls of the ocean of Divine Unity and the Repositories of Divine Revelation, have ever been the object of men's repudiation and denial. Even as He saith: \"Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay violent hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth.\" And again: \"No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to scorn.\"\n\nConsider the dispensation of Him Who is the Seal of the Prophets and the King of the Chosen Ones--may the souls of all mankind be offered up for His sake! After the Daystar of Truth dawned above the horizon of Hijaz, how great were the cruelties which the exponents of error inflicted upon that incomparable Manifestation of the All-Glorious! Such was their heedlessness that they regarded every injury inflicted upon that sacred Being as ranking among the greatest of all acts, and constituting a means of attainment unto God, the Most High. For in the early years of His mission the divines of that age, both Christian and Jewish, turned away from that Daystar of the heaven of glory, whereupon all people, high and low alike, bestirred themselves to extinguish the light of that Luminary of the horizon of inner meanings. The names of all these divines have been mentioned in the books of old; among them are Wahb ibn-i-Rahib, Ka'b ibn-i-Ashraf, 'Abdu'llah-i-Ubayy, and others of their like.\n\nFinally, matters came to such a pass that these men took counsel together and conspired to shed His pure blood, even as God--glorified be His mention!--saith: \"And remember when the disbelievers schemed against Thee, that they might lay hold upon Thee, or slay Thee, or cast Thee out; and so they schemed, and God schemed, and God, verily, is the best of schemers.\" Again He saith: \"But if their opposition be grievous to Thee--if Thou canst, seek out an opening into the earth or a ladder into heaven and bring to them a sign; yet if God wished, He could gather them unto true guidance; be Thou not, then, of the ignorant.\" By God! The hearts of His favoured ones are consumed at the purport of these two blessed verses. Such established and undisputed facts have been forgotten, and no one hath paused to reflect, in days past or in this day, upon the things that have prompted men to turn away from the Revealers of the light of God at the time of their manifestation.\n\nLikewise, before the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, consider Jesus, the Son of Mary. When that Manifestation of the All-Merciful revealed Himself, all the divines charged that Quintessence of faith with impiety and rebellion. Eventually, with the sanction of Annas, the most learned of the divines of His day, and Caiaphas, the high priest, His blessed person was made to suffer that which the pen is ashamed to mention and powerless to describe. The wide world in all its vastness could no longer contain Him, until at last God raised Him up unto heaven.\n\nWere a detailed account of all the Prophets to be given here, We fear that it might lead to weariness. The doctors of the Torah in particular assert that no independent Prophet will come after Moses with a new Law. They maintain that a Scion of the House of David shall be made manifest Who will promulgate the Law of the Torah, and help establish and enforce its commandments throughout the East and the West.\n\nThe followers of the Gospel, likewise, hold as impossible that the Bearer of a new Revelation should again shine forth from the dayspring of the Will of God after Jesus, Son of Mary--peace be upon Him! In support of this contention, they adduce the following verse from the Gospel: \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words of the Son of Man shall never pass away.\" They maintain that neither the teachings nor the commandments of Jesus--peace be upon Him!--may ever be altered.\n\nAt one point in the Gospel, He saith: \"I go away, and come again.\" Again in the Gospel of John, He hath foretold the advent of a Comforter who shall come after Him. In the Gospel of Luke, moreover, a number of signs and portents have been mentioned. Certain divines of that Faith, however, have interpreted these utterances after their own fancy, and have thus failed to grasp their true significance.\n\nO would that thou wouldst permit Me, O Shah, to send unto thee that which would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the souls, and persuade every fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book. Certain persons, incapable of answering the objections raised by their opponents, claim that the Torah and the Gospel have been corrupted, whereas in reality the references to such corruption pertain only to specific cases. But for the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of the divines, I would have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled and carried away the hearts unto a realm from the murmur of whose winds can be heard: \"No God is there but He!\" For the present, however, since the season is not ripe, the tongue of My utterance hath been stilled and the wine of exposition sealed up until such time as God, through the power of His might, shall please to unseal it. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord My God! I ask Thee by Thy Name, through which Thou hast subdued all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth, to protect the lamp of Thy Cause within the globe of Thine omnipotence and Thy bountiful favour, lest it be exposed to the blasts of denial from those who remain heedless of the mysteries of Thy name, the Unconstrained. Increase, then, by the oil of Thy wisdom, the radiance of its light. Thou, verily, hast power over all the dwellers of Thine earth and of Thy heaven.\n\nI implore Thee, O My Lord, by that most exalted Word which hath struck terror into the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth, save only those who have taken fast hold of Thy Sure Handle, not to abandon Me amidst Thy creatures. Lift Me up, then, unto Thyself, cause Me to enter beneath the shadow of Thy mercy, and give Me to drink of the pure wine of Thy providence, that I may dwell within the tabernacle of Thy majesty and beneath the canopy of Thy favour. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou, verily, art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO King! The lamps of equity have been extinguished, and the fire of tyranny hath so blazed on every side that My people have been led as captives from Zawra' to Mosul, known as ?adba'. This is not the first outrage that hath been suffered in the path of God. It behoveth every soul to consider and call to mind that which befell the kindred of the Prophet when the people took them captive and brought them unto Damascus, known as Fay?a'. Amongst them was the prince of them that worship God, the mainstay of such as have drawn nigh unto Him, and the sanctuary of those who long for His presence--may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto him!\n\nThey were asked: \"Are ye of the party of the Seceders?\" He replied: \"Nay, by the Lord Almighty. We are but servants who have believed in God and in His verses. Through us the countenance of faith hath beamed with joy. Through us the sign of the All-Merciful hath shone forth. At the mention of our names the desert of Ba??a hath overflowed with water and the darkness separating earth and heaven hath been dispelled.\"\n\n\"Have ye forbidden\", they were asked, \"that which God hath made lawful, or allowed that which He hath forbidden?\" \"We were the first to follow the divine commandments\", he answered. \"We are the root and origin of His Cause, the beginning of all good and its end. We are the sign of the Ancient of Days and the source of His remembrance amongst the nations.\"\n\nThey were asked: \"Have ye forsaken the Qur'an?\" \"In our House\", he replied, \"did the All-Merciful reveal it. We are the breezes of the All-Glorious amidst His creation. We are the streams that have branched out from the Most Great Ocean, through which God hath revived the earth, and through which He shall revive it again after it hath died. Through us His signs have been diffused, His proofs revealed, and His tokens disclosed. With us is the knowledge of His hidden meanings and His untold mysteries.\"\n\n\"For what crime have ye been punished?\" they were asked. \"For our love of God\", he made reply, \"and for our detachment from aught else save Him.\"\n\nWe have not related his exact words--peace be upon him!--but rather have We imparted a sprinkling from that ocean of life eternal that lieth enshrined within them, that those who hearken thereunto may be quickened and made aware of what hath befallen the trusted ones of God at the hands of a lost and wayward generation. We see the people in this day censuring the oppressors of bygone ages, whilst they themselves commit yet greater wrongs and know it not!\n\nGod beareth Me witness that My purpose hath not been to foment sedition, but to purify His servants from whatsoever hath prevented them from drawing nigh unto Him, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. I was asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of My Lord, the All-Merciful, passed over Me, awoke Me from My slumber, and bade Me lift up My voice betwixt earth and heaven. This thing is not from Me, but from God. Unto this testify the dwellers of His Dominion and of His Kingdom, and the inhabitants of the cities of His unfading glory. By Him Who is the Truth! I fear no tribulation in His path, nor any affliction in My love for Him and in the way of His good pleasure. Verily God hath made adversity as a morning dew upon His green pasture, and a wick for His lamp which lighteth earth and heaven.\n\nShall a man's wealth endure forever, or protect him from the One Who shall, erelong, seize him by his forelock? Gazing upon those who sleep beneath the gravestones, embosomed in the dust, could one ever distinguish the sovereign's crumbling skull from the subject's mouldering bones? Nay, by Him Who is the King of kings! Could one discern the lord from the vassal, or those that enjoyed wealth and riches from those who possessed neither shoes nor mat? By God! Every distinction hath been erased, save only for those who upheld the right and who ruled with justice.\n\nWhither are gone the learned men, the divines and potentates of old? What hath become of their discriminating views, their shrewd perceptions, their subtle insights and sage pronouncements? Where are their hidden coffers, their flaunted ornaments, their gilded couches, their rugs and cushions strewn about? Gone forever is their generation! All have perished, and, by God's decree, naught remaineth of them but scattered dust. Exhausted is the wealth they gathered, dispersed the stores they hoarded, dissipated the treasures they concealed. Naught can now be seen but their deserted haunts, their roofless dwellings, their uprooted tree-trunks, and their faded splendour. No man of insight will let wealth distract his gaze from his ultimate objective, and no man of understanding will allow riches to withhold him from turning unto Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High.\n\nWhere is he who held dominion over all whereon the sun shineth, who lived extravagantly on earth, seeking out the luxuries of the world and of all that hath been created upon it? Where is the commander of the swarthy legion and the upraiser of the golden standard? Where is the ruler of Zawra', and where the tyrant of Fay?a'? Where are those before whose munificence the treasure-houses of the earth shrank in shame, and at whose largesse and swelling spirit the very ocean was abashed? Where is he who stretched forth his arm in rebellion, and who turned his hand against the All-Merciful?\n\nWhere are they who went in quest of earthly pleasures and the fruits of carnal desires? Whither are fled their fair and comely women? Where are their swaying branches, their spreading boughs, their lofty mansions, their trellised gardens? And what of the delights of these gardens--their exquisite grounds and gentle breezes, their purling streams, their soughing winds, their cooing doves and rustling leaves? Where now are their resplendent morns and their brightsome countenances wreathed in smiles? Alas for them! All have perished and are gone to rest beneath a canopy of dust. Of them one heareth neither name nor mention; none knoweth of their affairs, and naught remaineth of their signs.\n\nWhat! Will the people dispute then that whereof they themselves stand witness? Will they deny that which they know to be true? I know not in what wilderness they roam! Do they not see that they are embarked upon a journey from which there is no return? How long will they wander from mountain to valley, from hollow to hill? \"Hath not the time come for those who believe to humble their hearts at the mention of God?\" Blessed is he who hath said, or now shall say, \"Yea, by my Lord! The time is come and the hour hath struck!\", and who, thereafter, shall detach himself from all that hath been, and deliver himself up entirely unto Him Who is the Possessor of the universe and the Lord of all creation.\n\nAnd yet, what hope! For naught is reaped save that which hath been sown, and naught is taken up save that which hath been laid down, unless it be through the grace and bestowal of the Lord. Hath the womb of the world yet conceived one whom the veils of glory shall not hinder from ascending unto the Kingdom of his Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most High? Is it yet within us to perform such deeds as will dispel our afflictions and draw us nigh unto Him Who is the Causer of causes? We beseech God to deal with us according to His bounty, and not His justice, and to grant that we may be of those who have turned their faces unto their Lord and severed themselves from all else.\n\nI have seen, O Shah, in the path of God what eye hath not seen nor ear heard. Mine acquaintances have repudiated Me, and My pathways have been straitened. The fount of well-being hath run dry, and the bower of ease hath withered. How numerous the tribulations which have rained, and will soon rain, upon Me! I advance with My face set towards Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous, whilst behind Me glideth the serpent. Mine eyes have rained down tears until My bed is drenched.\n\nI sorrow not for Myself, however. By God! Mine head yearneth for the spear out of love for its Lord. I never passed a tree, but Mine heart addressed it saying: \"O would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee, in the path of My Lord!\", for I see the people wandering distraught and unconscious in their drunken stupor. They have raised on high their passions and set down their God. Methinks they have taken His Cause for a mockery and regard it as a play and pastime, believing all the while that they do well, and that they dwell securely in the citadel of safety. Howbeit the matter is not as they fondly imagine: Tomorrow shall they behold that which today they are wont to deny!\n\nErelong shall the exponents of wealth and power banish Us from the land of Adrianople to the city of 'Akka. According to what they say, it is the most desolate of the cities of the world, the most unsightly of them in appearance, the most detestable in climate, and the foulest in water. It is as though it were the metropolis of the owl, within whose precincts naught can be heard save the echo of its cry. Therein have they resolved to imprison this Youth, to shut against our faces the doors of ease and comfort, and to deprive us of every worldly benefit throughout the remainder of our days.\n\nBy God! Though weariness lay Me low, and hunger consume Me, and the bare rock be My bed, and My fellows the beasts of the field, I will not complain, but will endure patiently as those endued with constancy and firmness have endured patiently, through the power of God, the Eternal King and Creator of the nations, and will render thanks unto God under all conditions. We pray that, out of His bounty--exalted be He--He may release, through this imprisonment, the necks of men from chains and fetters, and cause them to turn, with sincere faces, towards His face, Who is the Mighty, the Bounteous. Ready is He to answer whosoever calleth upon Him, and nigh is He unto such as commune with Him. We further beseech Him to make of this darksome tribulation a shield for the Temple of His Cause, and to protect it from the assault of sharpened swords and pointed daggers. Adversity hath ever given rise to the exaltation of His Cause and the glorification of His Name. Such hath been God's method carried into effect in centuries and ages past. That which the people now fail to apprehend they shall erelong discover, on that day when their steeds shall stumble and their finery be folded up, their blades blunted and their feet made to falter.\n\nI know not how long they shall spur on the charger of self and passion and rove in the wilderness of error and negligence! Shall either the pomp of the mighty or the wretchedness of the abased endure? Shall he who reposeth upon the loftiest seat of honour, who hath attained the pinnacle of might and glory, abide forever? Nay, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on earth shall pass away, and there remaineth alone the face of My Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.\n\nWhat armour hath not been pierced by the arrow of destruction, and what regal brow not divested by the hand of Fate? What fortress hath withstood the approach of the Messenger of Death? What throne hath not been shattered to pieces, what palace not reduced to rubble? Could the people but taste that choice Wine of the mercy of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, which lieth in store for them in the world beyond, they would assuredly cease their censure, and seek only to win the good pleasure of this Youth. For now, however, they have hidden Me behind a veil of darkness, whose fabric they have woven with the hands of idle fancy and vain imagination. Erelong shall the snow-white hand of God rend an opening through the darkness of this night and unlock a mighty portal unto His City. On that Day shall the people enter therein by troops, uttering what the blamers aforetime exclaimed, that there shall be made manifest in the end that which appeared in the beginning.\n\nIs it their wish to tarry here when already they have one foot in the stirrup? Look they to return, once they are gone? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of Lords! save on the Day of Judgement, the Day whereon the people shall arise from their graves and be asked of their legacy. Well is it with him who shall not be weighted down with his burdens on that Day, the Day whereon the mountains shall pass away and all shall gather to be questioned in the presence of God, the Most Exalted. Stern, indeed, is He in punishing!\n\nWe beseech God to purge the hearts of certain divines from rancour and enmity, that they may look upon matters with an eye unbeclouded by contempt. May He raise them up unto so lofty a station that neither the attractions of the world, nor the allurements of authority, may deflect them from gazing upon the Supreme Horizon, and that neither worldly benefits nor carnal desires shall prevent them from attaining that Day whereon the mountains shall be reduced to dust. Though they now rejoice in the adversity that hath befallen Us, soon shall come a day whereon they shall lament and weep. By My Lord! Were I given the choice between, on the one hand, the wealth and opulence, the ease and comfort, the honour and glory which they enjoy, and, on the other, the adversities and trials which are Mine, I would unhesitatingly choose My present condition and would refuse to barter a single atom of these hardships for all that hath been created in the world of being.\n\nBut for the tribulations that have touched Me in the path of God, life would have held no sweetness for Me, and Mine existence would have profited Me nothing. For them who are endued with discernment, and whose eyes are fixed upon the Sublime Vision, it is no secret that I have been, most of the days of My life, even as a slave, sitting under a sword hanging on a thread, knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon him. And yet, notwithstanding all this We render thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds, and yield Him praise at all times and under all conditions. He, verily, standeth witness over all things.\n\nWe beseech God to extend wide His shadow, that the true believers may hasten thereunto and that His sincere lovers may seek shelter therein. May He bestow upon men blossoms from the bowers of His grace and stars from the horizon of His providence. We pray God, moreover, to graciously aid the King to do His will and pleasure, and to confirm him in that which shall draw him nigh unto the Dayspring of God's most excellent names, so that he may not give countenance to the injustice he witnesseth, may look upon his subjects with the eye of loving-kindness, and shield them from oppression. We further beseech God, exalted be He, to gather all mankind around the Gulf of the Most Great Ocean, an ocean every drop of which proclaimeth that He is the Harbinger of joy unto the world and the Quickener of all its peoples. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning!\n\nAnd finally We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to enable thee to aid His Faith and turn towards His justice, that thou mayest judge between the people even as thou wouldst judge between thine own kindred, and mayest choose for them that which thou choosest for thine own self. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\n=== END BH00038 ===\n\n=== START BH00039 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the All-Dominant, the Self-Subsisting\n\nHe is the One manifest and speaking from His most exalted horizon\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the Wronged One to him who hath hearkened unto the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and who turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Most Glorious Name when they that dwell in the realm of creation turned away from Him. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Ancient of Days was established upon the throne of His Most Great Name in this most exalted Station, which hath been named by all names in the Crimson Tablet on a Day wherein the verses were sent down and the evidences were made manifest from God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! Hearken unto the call of the All-Bountiful. Verily He arose on this day and proceeded to another station. When He arrived, He spoke verses whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High and the Most Exalted Paradise were attracted, and all things cried out: \"The Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in earth and heaven.\" And We heard the glad-tidings of all things which were attracted by the rapture of the Call. Glorified be their Creator, their Mover and their Attractor through the Most Exalted Word, which, when it issued forth from the mouth of Will, caused the call to be raised from every direction: \"Glory and power and grandeur be unto God, the Lord of the Day of Return!\"\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! Thy letter hath come before the face of the Wronged One, and the servant present before His countenance hath read it. We perceived therefrom the fragrance of thy love for the face of God, the Lord of all men. We make mention of thee and those who believed before in verses at whose revelation all things bowed down in submission, yet most of the people are in strange doubt. They have forsaken their God and followed their desires. Verily they are among the erring in the Mother Book. Blessed art thou for having aided thy Lord before the faces of the servants. Thou didst speak in His Name and make mention of that which was sent down from the heaven of utterance from God, the Cleaver of Dawn. We were with you and heard what your tongues uttered. With Him is the knowledge of all things in the Mother Book. Thy likeness hath appeared before Our face, and We have written for thee from Our Most Exalted Pen the reward of attainment. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty which hath encompassed the horizons. This is a Day wherein the ocean of bounty hath surged before all beings, and the Dove of Paradise hath warbled upon the highest branches. Hearken, O people! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One calleth out with the most exalted call before the faces of the parties. Say:\n\n\"Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Aim, and bounty be unto Thee, O my Object of Worship, for having moved Thy Most Exalted Pen in remembrance of me while I was in the hands of those who disbelieved in Thy greatest signs and denied Thy proof which hath encompassed all regions. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the seas surged and the rivers flowed and the mysteries were revealed and the trees spoke forth in such wise as to attract the hearts of the righteous, to make me so steadfast that extinction shall not overtake me, so upright that sitting shall not follow, and so outspoken that silence shall not overcome me. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned unto the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee to ordain for me from the ocean of Thy knowledge the pearls of Thy wisdom, then write down for me that which shall abide with me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful Whom neither the world's contingencies can frustrate nor the might of nations can weaken. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Bestower.\"\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. Praise be unto God, thou hast attained unto acceptance and orientation and remembrance and praise, and hast arisen to serve the Cause. The reward of these deeds is a treasure preserved with God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nVerily, We make mention at this time of him who was named Muhammad-Rida that he may hear from the Divine Lote-Tree from this most exalted horizon that God - there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Muhammad-Qablir-Rida, for having voiced the praise of God, arisen to serve His Cause, and accomplished that which was recorded in the Tablet of thy Lord and preserved in the Crimson Book which none hath beheld save God, the Lord of all worlds. We have mentioned thee before in verses which, when revealed, caused the very rocks to soar, how much more the spirits. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having strengthened and enabled thee to achieve that which caused the limbs of men to quake, save those whom the Lord of creation preserved through a power before which all the might of earth and heaven proved impotent. When thou hast recited My verses and attained unto the Kawthar of Mine utterance, say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy proof, and guided me unto Thy path. I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath subdued all created things, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subjugated all things possible, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are detached, who hastened to the place of sacrifice out of their longing to meet Thee, and who gave up their lives in Thy path. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nO Ibrahim! Thy name hath been mentioned in this Most Exalted Station before the presence of the Lord of all beings. He hath remembered thee with such remembrance as hath enraptured the hearts of them that know, and hath stunned those servants who violated God's Covenant and Testament, and denied His proof, until they pronounced sentence for the shedding of His most holy, most pure, and most luminous blood. Thus did their souls entice them, yet they are among the most lost in God's Book, the Lord of this glorious and noble station. O Ibrahim! Canst thou take the chalice of utterance in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and drink therefrom despite the enemies, through My mention, the Mighty, the Wondrous? Say:\n\nO my God and my Master! Thou knowest me better than I know myself. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy service and vocal in Thy praise, in such wise that neither the hosts of the world nor the tyranny of earth's pharaohs who have held back Thy servants from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory and from entering the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness shall frighten me. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy riches, and the sick one before the shores of the ocean of Thy healing. I know not, O my God, whether my deeds shall hold me back from that which Thou hast mentioned, or whether through Thy bounty and generosity I shall be enabled to achieve that which I desire. By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of the world! I wish to place my trust in Thee in all conditions and to commit my affairs unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp lie the reins of the beginning and the end. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Yusuf, whom God hath delivered from the well of vain imaginings and illumined with the lights of certitude. We have mentioned him before - verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Expositor. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth the call of His loved ones and seeth their deeds, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The swords of the enemies cannot prevent Him from remembering whomsoever He pleaseth through a sovereignty from His presence. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O Yusuf! We have heard thy call and have called out to thee, and have seen thy turning and have turned toward thee from this far-distant Shore. When thou art illumined by the effulgences of the light of the Day-Star of My utterance and hast drunk from the hand of bounty the Kawthar of My proof, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou knowest and seest how separation from Thee hath melted my liver, how remoteness from Thy presence hath broken my back, and how exile from Thee hath well-nigh caused my death. I beseech Thee by the ocean of meeting with Thee, by the Kawthar of attaining Thy presence, by the breezes of nearness to Thee, and by the fragrance of Thy garment, to make me detached from all else but Thee, turning unto Thee, and holding fast to the cord of Thy grace. O Lord! Thou hearest the sighs of my heart in separation from Thee and seest the tears of mine eyes in my love for Thee. I beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowals to ordain for me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and art powerful over all things through Thy wondrous and mighty Word.\n\nO Ali, upon thee be My Glory! We bear witness that thou didst attain unto the Word \"Yea\" when the Call was raised from the Supreme Horizon, and wert of them that have attained. We bear witness to thy recognition, thy submissiveness, thy confession, thy humility, thy acknowledgment, and thy remembrance in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have sent down for thee that which shall cause the roses of inner meanings and utterance to grow in the garden of the knowledge of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Hearken unto the Call from the heaven of this Heaven: \"There is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Informed.\" Take the Salsabil of utterance from the hand of My bounty, then drink thereof in My Name and say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Thy sorrow hath consumed me, and Thy tribulation hath burned me, and by what hath befallen Thee my liver and my body and my frame have melted. By Thy glory! I long to go forth from my house and lament in the mountains and weep throughout the duration of Thy kingdom and cry out and say: 'Where art Thou, O Thou Goal of the mystics? And where art Thou, O Thou Beloved of those who dwell in the heavens and the earth?' Would that I had no soul and had not heard what hath befallen Thee from the calumniators who, when Thou didst desire salvation for them, desired for Thee that which caused the Holy Spirit to lament. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by Thy wronged state to aid me to be patient in Thy days and to endure Thy commandments and ordinances.\" Whereupon every vein of my veins and every pillar of my pillars and every member of my members shall cry out: \"My God, my God! My Lord and my Support! Pour forth upon me patience, then aid Thy loved ones against the oppressive people.\"\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Yusuf-i-'Ali who attained Our presence and heard My wondrous Call. O Yusuf! Forget not that which We counselled thee during thy presence. Take hold of the Book with power from thy Lord, then act according to what hath been revealed therein, and be not of the patient ones. Patience is praiseworthy except in My calamity. Thus hath the tongue of My grandeur spoken in this noble station.\n\nThy letter had previously come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before the Countenance presented it. We have answered thee with what hath been revealed at this time. When thou hast attained unto My verses and drunk the choice wine of justice from the cup of My bounty, say:\n\n\"My God, my God! I am he who acknowledgeth his transgressions and his sins in Thy days. I beseech Thee by Thy gracious Name, and by Thy merciful Name, and by Thy forgiving Name, and by Thy clement Name, that Thou forgive me and remit my evil deeds. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. O Lord! Thou seest the sinner desiring the ocean of Thy forgiveness and the heedless one seeking the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the vastness of Thy verses and the mysteries of Thy wisdom and the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, hoping for Thy pardon, anticipating Thy generosity, and awaiting the wonders of Thy bounty which have encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Loving.\"\n\nO My Pen! Make mention of him who hath loved Me and heard My Call and attained My presence and taken from the cup of My bounty the Kawthar of My utterance and drunk in My Name and remembrance. Verily, he was named Mahdi in My scroll and in My perspicuous Tablet.\n\nO Mahdi! The Wronged One makes mention of thee on a day when the oppressors have encompassed Him on all sides with swords of falsehood and calumny. Verily thy Lord is not hindered by aught whatsoever from that which He willeth. He, verily, is the One Who ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth through His firm and mighty command. We have mentioned thee before, and at this hour through this perspicuous Book. Blessed art thou for having been faithful to My Covenant and My Testament, and for having turned toward My Prison with detachment adorned with the acceptance of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the Powerful. The splendor shining from the horizon of My utterance be upon thee and upon thy wife. Give her glad tidings from Me and remind her of My verses. I am, verily, the Rememberer, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nSay: O My handmaiden and My leaf! Thou hast been blessed with My mention time and again, and this is yet another time, a bounty from God, the Lord of all beings. Be thankful and say: Unto Thee be praise and glory, unto Thee be mention and splendor. Thy handmaiden testifieth to Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty, Thy might and Thy power. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nO Pen! Make mention, from the presence of the Ancient King, of him who was named Rida in the Kingdom of Names, who attained the presence of the Wronged One when He was in His Most Great Prison. Remember My days and thy standing at the gate of My favor and thy presence before My face, and thine attentiveness to My sweet call, for which ears were created. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Expositor. We have revealed in every matter that which the tongues of the world are powerless to enumerate. Of this beareth witness he who possesseth a perspicuous Book.\n\nO Rida! He Who was named Muhammad-Rida hath made mention of thee before the Face, and We have sent thee a fragrance from the fragrances of Revelation. Be thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of faithfulness and Creator of earth and heaven, for having remembered me when I was in the midst of the deluded ones. Verily, he who mentioned thee hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion, and the mercy of thy Lord hath encompassed him from all sides, until the hand of bounty caused him to enter the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nO Husayn! Husayn maketh mention of thee, He whose limbs and members, were one to observe them, would be found pierced by the arrows of hatred and the spears of the enemies' calumnies. Yet He was, and ever will be, content with whatsoever hath befallen Him, in such wise that neither tribulations could prevent Him from the mention of the Lord of Names, nor could the might of the oppressors frighten Him. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy path, given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance, and sent down unto me from the heaven of knowledge the table of Thy bounty, and for having mentioned me in Thy Book. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which the sincere ones have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and meeting, and those who are nigh have ascended unto the heaven of Thy generosity and grace, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. O Lord! Ordain for me that which will preserve me from all else save Thee and draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Thou art, verily, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! Thou hast mentioned him who was named after Me. We have mentioned him time and again and sent unto him a Tablet from whose horizon the luminary of God's favor, the Lord of all worlds, hath shone forth. Say: Remember those days when thou wert present before the Face and didst hear the call of the Wronged One and drink the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of My Name, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him, to strengthen him, and to ordain for him that which shall never end in mention nor cease in fragrance. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nO Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who was named Rida in the precincts of might and bounty, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all names. We testify that thou hast attained unto divine good-pleasure and thy deeds have been accepted. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this supreme bounty and this great favor which shall not change throughout the eternity of My most beautiful names. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee a pillar in this Cause and through thee to open the doors of the hearts of them that are heedless. We have been with Our loved ones and have heard their call and their words, and have seen their deeds, and verily We are the Hearing, the Answering. We have made mention of thee before, and at this time, and shall mention thee hereafter in a perspicuous Tablet, that it may remain as a remembrance in the scrolls and be recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Let not events sadden thee. Hold fast unto the cord of trust in all conditions unto the Strong, the Prevailing, the Almighty. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy father who hath mentioned thee time and again, and upon every steadfast and upright one, and upon thy brother who was named 'Ali in the Book of Names and in this perspicuous Tablet. We beseech God to protect you and to aid you and draw you nigh unto Him and to give drink from the ocean of His healing to whomsoever He willeth. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous. Grieve not over anything. He is with you. Soon shall the carpet of tyranny be rolled up and your mention and your traces and your names shall be spread amongst the servants. Unto this doth testify this Speaking Book, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nO Joseph! The promise hath come to pass and the Herald hath called out from every direction: \"O Manifestations of Names and Attributes! Rejoice in that the veils have been rent asunder and the Revealer of verses hath come with such sovereignty that before it can stand neither the hosts of earth nor of heaven.\" Thus hath the matter been decreed at this time. Take hold of the Book with the strength granted by Us and cleave unto it as bidden by Us, and I am verily the Commanding, the All-Wise.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Abraham and give him glad tidings of that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Most Exalted Pen in his remembrance, that the bounty of his Lord and His utterance may draw him to this luminous horizon. O Abraham! When thou findest the fragrance of My remembrance and hearest My call, arise, turning thy face toward My direction, and say:\n\n\"My God, my God! I testify that by Thy Most Exalted Word Thou didst create all things, and by Thy Most Great Name were raised the stations of the nations, and through the revelations of the Day-Star of Thy manifestation were illumined the hearts of them that have turned toward Thee and of the sincere ones. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy manifestation and the warmth of Thy love and the fire of the Tree of Thy Mount to cause to be uttered for Thy Face a word whereby all created things may be attracted. O my Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Withhold not Thy loved ones from the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty nor from the effulgences of the Sun of Thy generosity. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\nO Joseph! We have sent down for thee and for those with thee that whose fragrance shall not cease throughout the eternity of the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praised. We counsel thee and those who have believed to show forth love and affection and kindliness and unity, and that whereby your stations may be exalted among the peoples of the earth. And I am verily the Counselor, the Manifest, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Husayn! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon and say:\n\n\"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art my Ultimate Goal, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy utterance and having revealed unto me that which was hidden from most of Thy creation. I testify, O my God, by Thy might and Thy grandeur and Thy forgiveness and Thy bounty, I beseech Thee by the pearls that have appeared from Thy Most Exalted Pen to send down upon me that which will preserve me from all else besides Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\"\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! We have arisen to establish the Cause in days wherein darkness hath encompassed all regions. When the light shone forth, he who was named Hadi emerged from behind the veil and spoke that which consumed the hearts of them that were nigh unto God, whom all that was created on earth could not hinder from turning toward the Dayspring of Signs. We beseech God to aid thee to manifest such steadfastness that neither names nor all that the peoples possess shall deter thee from turning toward the straight path. We counsel thee and enjoin upon thee trustworthiness, which God hath made to adorn the temple of His loved ones, and godliness, whereby the order of the world hath been established and nations have found tranquility. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the Counselor. Beware lest the clamoring of them that have denied the Proof and rejected the Testament sadden thee. Say: O people! Fear ye God, and follow not every ignorant impostor. That which was hidden hath been revealed and that which was treasured hath been made manifest. Thus hath the fragrance of God's utterance, the Lord of the beginning and the end, been wafted abroad.\n\nO Muhammad-Ja'far! The Lord of Destiny from the direction of His Most Great Scene hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in such wise as to attract the hearts of the righteous. Blessed is the servant who hath heard the call and turned unto it with humility and contrition. This is the Day of nearness and of meeting, the Day of bounty and of giving. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto every heedless doubter. This is the Day wherein the sea hath disclosed its mysteries and its waves, the mountains their treasures, the heaven its stars, the sun its radiance, and the Temple of the Manifestation His proof and His testimony, His grandeur and His sovereignty, as a grace and mercy from Him unto His servants.\n\nO Pen! Bear thou witness that thou hast not fallen short in thy remembrance, and hast called out to the servants and commanded all as We commanded thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Let not the veils of the doubters and the objections of the croakers sadden thee. Arise and say: O 'Ali-Asghar! Hearken unto that which hath been raised from the direction of God's Most Great Scene. He maketh mention of thee and of them that have believed, with such remembrance as illumineth the horizons. We remember him who remembereth Us, and aid him in that which draweth him nigh unto the Dayspring of Signs. When the rapture of My call seizeth thee from the horizon of My Manifestation, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to turn toward Thee, and thanks be to Thee for having inspired me with Thy remembrance. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance, by that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge, by the tears of them that know Thee in their separation from Thee, and by the sighs of them that yearn for Thee in their remoteness from Thy presence, to make me one of them whom the weapons of the world cannot frighten, nor the might of nations dismay. Then ordain for me that which shall profit me. Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! We have mentioned thee before with verses that caused the seas of meanings and utterance to surge, and by which the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, was diffused. I bear witness that thou hast attained unto the recognition of the Cause and believed in Him through Whom the tribes of the earth were seized with trembling and the limbs of every obstinate infidel were made to quake. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me detached from all else but Thee and clinging unto Thee and Thy signs. I beseech Thee to make me, in all conditions, gazed toward Thee, speaking Thy praise, and holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy. Thou art, verily, the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all that are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! We have heard thy call and turned toward thee to impart unto thee that which shall make thee detached from all else save Me and cause thee to hold fast unto My firm cord. We love them that have turned toward the Countenance and make mention of them in such wise as shall endure throughout the duration of the kingdom of God, the Lord of the glorious Throne. We counsel thee and them that have believed to perform such deeds as shall diffuse the fragrance of divine acceptance. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Beware lest the tyranny of any remote oppressor grieve thee, or the doubts of them that have denied the Day of Judgment hinder thee. When the attraction of the call from the supreme horizon seizeth thee, say:\n\n\"O Lord of all names and Creator of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and by the standards of Thy guidance in the world of creation to make me of them that have spent what they possessed in Thy path and whom the warmth of Thy love hath so seized that naught whatsoever hath deterred them from turning toward the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy bounty and the sick one turning toward the ocean of Thy healing. Ordain for me, O my God, that which beseemeth the heaven of Thy glory and the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the Gracious.\"\n\nO My loved ones in Alif and Sin (Ashku)! Rejoice that the Lord of eternity hath turned toward you from His Most Great Prison and desired to make mention of you in such wise that your names shall endure in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. This is a day wherein whosoever hath sought hath attained unto the Desired One, and whosoever hath yearned hath attained unto this glorious and wondrous station.\n\nO Ahmad! Set thy face toward God, the Almighty, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, and say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Drive me not from Thy door, withhold me not from the ocean of Thy bounty, disappoint me not from the manifestations of the lights of the Sun of Thy grace, and remove me not from the carpet of Thy nearness. Thou knowest and seest that I have turned with my whole being toward Thee and have desired from Thee only that which shall strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy love and to arise to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause whereby Thy earth and heaven were illumined, and by that which was raised from the Tree of Sinai, to ordain for me that which shall make me so detached from all else save Thee that my tongue shall move only in Thy remembrance, my face shall turn only toward the lights of Thy countenance, mine ear shall hear naught save that which hath proceeded from Thy Most Exalted Pen and Thy sweetest call, and mine eyes shall behold only Thy visible tokens in all things. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all, whether of old or more recent times.\"\n\nO Muhammad-Aqa! By God, the Glory hath not manifested Himself except for the salvation of the world and the upliftment of the peoples. The Most Great Book of God beareth witness to this in this exalted station. This is a day wherein that which was hidden from eternity of eternities and treasured in the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath appeared. Blessed is the eye that hath seen and witnessed, and the ear that hath heard when the Call was raised, and woe unto every heedless and remote one. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be unto Thee for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy manifestation and my countenance with the radiance of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued both the unseen and the visible, to make me a banner of Thy Name amongst Thy servants and one who voices Thy praise throughout Thy lands. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, the One possessed of great bounty. Never hast Thou disappointed those who hoped in Thee, nor turned away those who sought Thee. I testify to Thy might and Thy grandeur, Thy sovereignty and Thy power, Thy loftiness and Thy dominion, and that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. O Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who drank the wine of martyrdom in Thy Name and the Kawthar of sacrifice in Thy love. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nO Mir Muhsin! The peoples of the earth have risen against Me in harm save whom God, the Omnipotent, the All-Wise, hath willed. We summoned them to the highest horizon and desired for them that which would draw them nigh unto the Mighty, the Beautiful. Yet they denied My grace, My bounty, My generosity and My mercy which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We desired for them the light, yet they desired for Us that which caused the near ones to lament. They expelled Us from Our homeland with such tyranny as caused the faces of the Concourse on High to turn pale, and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. When thou hast drunk the cup of recognition, say:\n\nO my Lord, the All-Merciful! I beseech Thee by the Mother Book and by Thy establishment upon the Throne of proof to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and Thy love, and firm in exalting Thy Word amongst Thy creation. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me in what I seek from the ocean of Thy bestowal and the heaven of Thy bounty and grace. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Kind, the Forgiving.\n\nWe make mention of thy mother and beseech God to send down upon her mercy from the clouds of His grace and rain from the heaven of His bounty. Then write for her with the ink of light that which will honor her in the days of the Manifestation. He, verily, is the Omnipotent over what He willeth through His word, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nO Mir Ali-Asghar! The Lord of Destiny, while between the fangs of wolves, makes mention of His loved ones in spite of those who denied His Manifestation and disputed His signs. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. He knoweth the treachery of eyes and what the breasts of those who denied the Promised Day conceal. We made mention of thee before through verses that enraptured hearts and minds, and at this time through verses that have no equal among the people. He in Whose possession is a hidden Book beareth witness to this. When thou hearest the call, say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, for having caused me to turn toward Thy horizon, to acknowledge what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, and to hold fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation to ordain for me that which will exalt me amongst Thy creation and assist me to serve Thy loved ones. O Lord! The poor one hath sought the ocean of Thy riches and the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him in what he seeketh. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Mir Ali-Asghar! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We found in it that which testified to thy steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped save whom God, the Lord of this exalted station, willed. We have made mention of thee time and again with that which hath diffused the fragrance of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. We beseech Him once more to make thee firm in the service of His Cause and a helper in His days. Verily, He is the most powerful of the powerful ones.\n\nO Mir Ali-Akbar! We have at this moment turned towards thee and revealed for thee that which God hath made the Dawning-Place of Light unto all who dwell in His realms. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this at this hour. Be thou not grieved at anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Beauteous. Verily, He loveth those who put their trust in Him and exalteth them through His grace. He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. We make mention of thee and My loved ones in that land, and We counsel you with that whereby the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, may be uplifted. Beware lest names hold you back from their Creator, or causes from their Originator, or the Book from its Revealer, the Almighty, the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing. Say: My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and I acknowledge Thy power and Thy might. I bear witness that Thou hast manifested and revealed that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and concealed from the eyes of Thy servants. I beseech Thee by the rain-showers of Thy mercy and the pearls of the ocean of Thy grandeur to make me strong through Thy power and steadfast through Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all things.\n\nO Hasan! This is a Day wherein God hath made the horizon of Akka the Dawning-Place of His Call, which hath been raised at this hour to such heights that the denizens of the Kingdom on high and of the realm below have heard it. Blessed, blessed, then blessed, blessed is he who hath heard and turned towards it and hath said: \"Here am I, O Lord of the worlds! Here am I, O Possessor of all existence!\" That which was treasured in the Books of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, hath been made manifest. Say: By God! The ears have been created to hearken unto the rustling of My Lote-Tree, the flowing of the Kawthar of My loving-kindness, and the whispering of the breezes of My bounty. Joy be unto him who hath attained unto the outpourings of My days, and woe betide every denier and veiled one. Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God, and glorified art Thou, O my Object of Desire! Thou seest me turning towards Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty, and awaiting the manifestations of Thy mercy and Thy gifts. I beseech Thee, O Thou through Whose command the Tree of Knowledge spoke unto the son of Imran and those nigh unto Thee hastened to the Dayspring of Light, to make me firm, steadfast and unwavering in Thy love and Thy Cause, and to enable me to speak Thy praise with wisdom and utterance. Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by the lights of Thy countenance, to assist me and my son in remembering Thee and in remembering Thy loved ones, and in serving Thee and serving Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nO Pen! Thy scratching hath been raised throughout the world. We have breathed into thee a command from Our presence, whereupon all in the cities and lands were thunderstruck, save whom God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, pleased. Make mention of him who was named Mashhadi before Husayn, and illumine him with the lights of thy Lord's utterance, the Lord of existence. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens, for having made known unto me Thy path, caused me to hear Thy call, shown me Thy traces, and remembered me in Thy prison. I beseech Thee, O Revealer of verses, by Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall make me eloquent in Thy Name, known for Thy service, and active in performing that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, by Thy Name, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be.\n\nO Hasan! The Wronged One hath at this moment turned towards thee and revealed for thee that which God hath made the Kawthar of immortality for all who dwell in the world of creation. Blessed is he who hath heard and hastened and drunk and said \\[...\\]\n\nMy soul be a sacrifice for Thy grace, O Lord of all being, and my spirit be a ransom for Thy bounty, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all names. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses, the lights of Thy throne, and the radiance of Thy Cause which hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of Thy manifestation, to make me and Thy servants among those who have aided Thy Cause through counsels and admonitions, and who have offered up their souls in Thy path. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the Omnipotent over the seen and unseen.\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! Thy name hath appeared before the Wronged One. We have made mention of thee in such wise as hath caused the fragrance of revelation to waft throughout the world and the sweet perfume of utterance to be diffused amongst the nations, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Gracious. The verses have encompassed all regions, yet most of the people remain heedless. This is a Day wherein every tongue hath spoken, every seated one hath arisen, and all things have proclaimed this Name through which the eyes of the yearning ones have been gladdened.\n\nO concourse of ardent lovers! The Day of the Covenant hath come. Hasten ye, then hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in this glorious and wondrous station. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and responded to their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nO Ghaffar! The Chosen One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and hath made mention of thee in such wise as hath enraptured the hearts of them that know. Take heed lest the happenings of the world hold thee back from drawing nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and lest the veils of them that have gone astray prevent thee from drawing close to the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty and hast heard My most sweet call from the motion of My Most Exalted Pen, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me while I was in the clutches of mine enemies, and thanks be unto Thee for having turned toward Thy servant from Thy Most Exalted Horizon. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the revelations of the Orb of Thy utterance, to aid me to make mention of Thee amongst Thy servants and to praise Thee in Thy lands. Then write down for me, O my Beloved, that which Thou hast written for them that are near unto Thee among Thy creation, who have hastened to the place of sacrifice out of their longing to meet Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO Javad! The Lord of creation maketh mention of thee in this station which hath been named by all names by God, the Lord of Lords. We have remembered thee and those who have believed with such remembrance as hath caused the fragrance of God to be wafted throughout all lands. Verily, He loveth His friends who were not frightened by the might of the oppressors nor by the roaring of those who have denied God, the Lord of all men. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of inner meanings and utterance from the Pen of the All-Merciful, say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my Goal, and glorification be unto Thee, O my Beloved, and splendor be unto Thee, O Ultimate Object of my hope! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the dawning-places of Thy commandments and ordinances, and by Him Who is established upon the throne of utterance through Thy power and Who speaketh before all faces without veil or covering, to make me in all conditions submissive to the hands of Thy Cause, looking toward the horizon of Thy justice, immersed in the ocean of Thy verses, and seeking refuge at Thy threshold. Verily, Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and the power of the world cannot prevent Thee from that which Thou hast willed by Thy sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nO My Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned towards My horizon, beheld My signs, and heard My Call - he who hath been named Hasan in the Book of God, the Lord of all men. O Hasan! We have turned unto thee from this Station and counsel thee with that which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Book. Cast away what the people possess and take what thou hast been given from God, the Revealer of verses. We have commanded all with that which draweth them nigh unto the Dayspring of Light, yet they desire that which removeth them far from God, the Cause of the flowing of rivers. Say: O people! Fear God! The Promise hath appeared and the Day hath come, by the command of God, Who causeth the winds to blow. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the Known, and how many an ignorant one hath heard and said: \"Here am I, O Manifestation of clear proofs!\" Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Mutual Calling.\n\nO Siyyid-Muhammad! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. He desireth naught in all creation save to quench the fire of hatred. Every discerning one beareth witness unto this. Say: O people! Do what ye have been commanded and follow not every heedless doubter. We have created you and those who believe for this Day which was promised in the Books of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Beware lest ye deny God's grace and bounty. Follow that which hath been sent down from the Pen of Revelation in this perspicuous Tablet. This is a Day wherein rivers have flowed and trees have spoken even as the Tree of Revelation hath spoken upon the Mount of Knowledge by the command of the Ordainer, the All-Wise. When thou art illumined by the lights of the Throne and hast quaffed the choice wine of immortality from this cup, turn thy face toward God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, and say:\n\nMy God, my God! Unto Thee be greatness and perpetuity, unto Thee be glory and bounty! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the mysteries of Thy knowledge, and by the mountains whereon Thy call was raised, and by the lands honored by Thy footsteps, and by the hands which were lifted to the heaven of Thy bounty, that Thou forgive me and Thy loved ones and those who have not broken Thy Covenant and Testament and have done what they were bidden in Thy Great Book.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! At this moment We have heard the call of the Most Exalted Paradise crying out and saying:\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice unto Thy call, O Beloved of those who dwell on earth and in heaven, and my soul be a sacrifice unto Thy remembrance, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names! The sweetness of Thy call hath so enraptured me that I find for myself neither tranquility nor rest. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom and Sovereign of the Realm Above, by Thy Most Great Name through which the gates of knowledge were opened unto all peoples, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones who arose to serve Thy Cause and voiced Thy praise before the faces of Thy servants, whom neither the might of the oppressors nor the tyranny of the Pharaohs nor the clamor of such as have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment could deter. O Lord! Disappoint me not from the ocean of Thy bounty in Thy days, and deprive me not of what Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones. I testify to my powerlessness and Thy might, my poverty and Thy wealth, and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO 'Abbas-'Ali! The wolves have surrounded the sheep of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. They have followed their desires and cast their God behind them, yet they perceive it not. The light hath shone forth from the horizon of Revelation, yet most people understand not. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and caused all things to speak in remembrance of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. When thou hearest My call and art enraptured by the sweetness of My voice, say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me, and all bounty be unto Thee for having nurtured me. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the mysteries of Thy Book to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise, and to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will exalt me amongst Thy servants through Thy Name, and cause me to enter the precincts of Thy great mercy. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.\n\nO Mashhadi Jafar! This is the Day wherein the Book speaketh and calleth all to the Mighty, the Bestower. Among the people are those who have cast aside the multitudes and what they possess, turning unto God, the Lord of Lords; among them are those who have followed their desires, turning away from guidance; and among them are those who have halted, following every heedless doubter. This is the Day of the appearance of Him Whose advent was heralded in the Books of God, the Lord of all men. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of Mine utterance and drinkest from the Kawthar of My knowledge, say:\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and to behold Thy signs. I beseech Thee by the revelations of Thy names and attributes, by Thy most sweet call and Thy Most Great, Most Holy, Most Glorious Name, to strengthen me in such steadfastness in Thy Cause that the doings of those who have denied Thee and Thy signs shall not deter me. O Lord! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge, my sight with the vision of Thy signs, and my ears with the hearing of Thy utterance. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison. Say: O people! By God, ye were created to hearken unto this most sweet Call that hath been raised from 'Akka, from the Divine Lote-Tree. Be ye not of the heedless. Ye were promised this Day and this Most Great Name in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is the Day wherein those near unto God have attained the presence of their Lord, hearing that which My Most Holy Tongue uttereth in this sacred, mighty and wondrous station. Thus have We sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, while the people are in evident loss. Say:\n\nO Lord! Thou seest Thy unitarians among the heedless ones. I beseech Thee by the hosts of might and power who aided Thy Cause at the appearance of the Manifestations of Thy power, the Daysprings of Thy Cause, and the Dawning-Places of Thy sovereignty, to make me and Thy loved ones among those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward Thy most exalted horizon - they have advanced and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\"\n\nO Zaynu'l-'Abidin! We beseech God to adorn hearts and souls with the light of unity and concord. Verily, He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.\n\nO My loved ones! Give thanks unto God for having drawn you nigh unto Him and for having sent down unto you that from which every possessor of perception catcheth the fragrance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to assist you with power from His presence and authority from His own Self. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth through His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Grieve not over anything; soon there shall appear unto you that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Sorrows have encompassed Us from every direction through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to the whisperings of the satans. Say: Fear God, and follow not those who have denied God, disputed His sovereignty, and rejected that which hath been sent down from His Sacred Pen, the Mighty, the Firm. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have heard the Call and have said: \"Yea, yea, O Thou the Desire of the hearts of the mystics!\"\n\nO 'Ali-Qabli-Ashraf! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One proclaimeth, yet the people remain in grievous remoteness. They have violated God's Covenant and His Testament, and denied that which hath appeared from Him. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are in manifest loss. Blessed is he who, being assured, hath turned unto the Countenance, and woe unto every hesitating doubter. We hear from the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha that which calleth the servants unto the Dayspring of God's Command, the Lord of the worlds; and from the murmuring of the living waters - by God! - the gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of Names hath come with a Cause before which neither armies, nor ranks, nor the might of the idolators can stand. And from the whistling of the winds - by God! - He hath come for the reformation of all things, whereunto testifieth the Lamp of the world which burneth amidst tempestuous winds, saying: \"O people! I have come to you from the horizon of power with a mighty Command. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the effusions of this Day. Cast away your vain imaginings, holding fast to that which ye have been bidden by an All-Wise Commander.\" Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged, and the light shone forth from the horizon of certitude. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless doubters. Rejoice thou in what hath been sent down to thee from the heaven of bounty - that whose mention shall never cease throughout the duration of Names. To this testifieth He with Whom is the glorious Book.\n\nO Faraj! By God! The relief hath come, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: The relief is My manifestation, then My establishment upon the throne of My grandeur, then My utterance amongst My servants, and I am the All-Knowing Expounder. Rejoice in that the Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee and mentioned thee in such wise as to attract the hearts of them who are nigh unto God. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, and be not of the patient ones. Patience is praiseworthy except when His decisive, wise Command hath been revealed. We beseech God to open before thy face, and the faces of His loved ones, the gates of grace and bounty, and to ordain for thee and for them that which shall protect you from the evil of the enemies who hear and deny. We testify that they are among the oppressors. Let not the happenings of the world sadden thee, nor the tyranny of nations who are prevented by their deeds from turning to the lights of their Lord's countenance, the Manifest, the Speaking, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by the suns of the heavens of Thy grandeur and by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nO Zaynu'l-'Abidin! We beseech God to adorn His Cause through thee. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good. That which never appeared in the world hath become manifest, and the call hath been raised from the direction of 'Akka in such wise that the Concourse on High hath heard it, whereunto beareth witness the Most Glorious Temple in this sacred and lofty station. When thou hearest the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, say: O Lord of all beings and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee by Thy radiant, gleaming Light and by Thy mighty, wondrous Name, whereby Thou hast raised the standard of Thy justice and elevated the banner of Thy Cause, to make me so firm and steadfast in Thy love that neither the doubts of the learned nor the cawing of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, may cause me to slip.\n\nO Muhammad-Hasan! The Lord of the world turneth unto thee from the precincts of 'Akka, wherein the Call hath been raised. Blessed is he who hath turned and heard and said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of them of old!\" Let not the affairs of the world grieve thee, nor the might of the nations deter thee. Cast away what the people possess and take what hath been given thee by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Say: The river of wisdom hath flowed from the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous, and the sun of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Mother Book which now speaketh: \"I am the Object of worship of them that are nigh.\" When thou hast drunk the choice wine of utterance from the Pen of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: \"O Thou Desire of creation! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, turning away from all else, and hoping for Thy bountiful grace. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.\"\n\nO Ibrahim! We desire to make mention of thee in such wise as to attract thee to the horizon whence shineth the light of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have manifested that which lay hidden in the treasury of God's protection, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: O people! Be fair and follow not the imaginings of the heedless. The Tree hath yielded its fruit, the sun hath shone forth, and the Herald hath proclaimed: \"The Beloved of all in the heavens and earth hath come!\" Let not the power of the people weaken thee, nor those who have denied God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, frighten thee. Say: My God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones to serve Thy Cause, then make them to be of those whom the might of the world and the clamour of the nations have not weakened, and ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones. Verily Thou art He to Whose sovereignty all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur all possible things have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful. O Lord! Thou seest me believing in Thee and in Thy signs, and acknowledging what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace. Verily Thou art God, the Single One, the All-Informed.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! Upon thee be the grace of God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. We have sent down for every name that which hath caused the fragrance of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne, to waft. We beseech God to aid His loved ones and enable them to arise to serve His Cause. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.\n\nO Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory! The Wronged One maketh mention of His loved ones and remembereth them by night and by day, that the breezes of remembrance might take hold of them and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of lords. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Dayspring of utterance and attained unto that which was hidden from the Supreme Pen in the scriptures and tablets. We bear witness that thou \\[...\\] and heard the Call when it was raised in truth by the command of God, the Cleaver of Dawn. We counsel thee to preserve what thou hast been given, and We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid thee in that which thou hast been bidden by God, the Revealer of laws.\n\nAnd We make mention of thy father who turned unto My horizon and heard My call and drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of thy Lord's bounty, the Lord of creation. Blessed is he for having acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken and recognized what hath been revealed in the Mother Book.\n\nAnd We make mention of thy mother who migrated from the earthly homeland, seeking the supreme homeland beneath the shadow of God's grace, the Causer of rivers to flow.\n\nO My handmaiden! Hear My call. We have mentioned thee before and do so at this time as a token of Our grace, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nO Mim-before-Ha! We wish to bestow Our favor upon thee once again and make mention of thy brothers and aid them to arise to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of all men.\n\nO My servants! Upon you rest My glory and favor. We testify that you have turned towards the Countenance and desired to attain the presence at the Gate which was opened unto all who dwell in earth and heaven. We beseech God to preserve and protect you through the hosts of the seen and unseen, and to send down upon you from the clouds of grace the rains of bounty and favors. We make mention of My handmaidens and My leaves in the midst of tribulations wrought by the hands of those who have denied the Day of Reckoning. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon them mercy from His presence and to open before their faces the gates of blessings. Verily, He is the Revealer of verses and the Lord of names and attributes. There is no God but I, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, and the One Who speaks on the Day of Reckoning.\n\nO Mahdi! We have made mention of thee and those whom God has related unto thee as a token of Our grace, for I am the Mighty, the All-Bounteous. Blessed is the servant who hath heard what the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered, and blessed is he who hath held fast unto righteousness and godliness in the days of God, the Sender of winds.\n\nWe have desired to make mention of him who was named Siyyid-i-Qabl-i-Kazim and to adorn his head with the crown of bounty and his temple with the ornament of God's favor, the Revealer of verses. When thou art seized with the sweetness of thy Lord's utterance, arise and turn thyself toward the Prison of 'Akka and say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, for having guided me unto Thy path and remembered me through Thy verses, and sent down unto me that whose fragrance shall not cease throughout the duration of Thy kingdom. I beseech Thee, O King of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy Most Mighty Name and by Thy Most Loving Name, to assist me and my kindred in that which Thou lovest and approvest. O Lord! Deny us not the ocean of Thy bounty, nor the heaven of Thy generosity, nor the sun of Thy grace. Send down upon us at all times that which will draw us nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Karim! The Most Great Ocean from this most exalted station, namely the Prison of 'Akka, hath turned toward thee and toward His loved ones, and desireth to manifest unto them the pearls of wisdom and utterance, that they may give thanks unto their Lord, the All-Bounteous, the All-Generous. We have turned toward those who have turned toward the Supreme Horizon, and have mentioned them in such wise as hath caused all things to be attracted. He is the Helper, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We beseech God to open before thy face and their faces the gates of gifts and favors, and to ordain for you that whereby His Word may be exalted among His servants and His Cause in His lands. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth, and He is the One, the Alone, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nWe make mention of 'Abdu'l-Husayn that he may give thanks unto God Who hath caused all things to speak His praise on this Day whereon the Most Great Ocean hath revealed its pearls, the earth its treasures, and the sun its effulgence and radiance. All this is through the grace of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Say:\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and unto Thee be greatness and majesty, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of all mankind! I beseech Thee by Thy most sweet call and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of the Hereafter and of the former world, to assist me in serving Thy Cause amongst Thy servants. Then make me the cupbearer of the water of Thy proof unto the people of Thy kingdom. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Compelling, the All-Informed.\n\nO Lu?fu'llah! The promise hath come to pass and the Lord of the world maketh mention of thee in such wise as shall adorn thee with the ornament of detachment and the crown of trustworthiness among all people. Say: \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my Best-Beloved, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Adored One! I testify that through Thee hath been manifested that which was hidden from all eyes and concealed with God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: My God, my God! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge, then preserve me from the whisperings of them who have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs. O Lord! Thou seest me detached from all else but Thee. Strengthen me through Thy bounty and generosity. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Sovereign over all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nO Qasim! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. It will draw thee nigh unto Mine horizon and will adorn thee with that which will exalt thee amongst My servants. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Despair not of the Spirit of God. He is with His servants who have turned unto Him, who have not broken His covenant and His testament, and who have proclaimed with the most exalted call: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Chosen One!\"\n\nThy letter hath come before the Wronged One, as well as that which was sent by him who is named Abdullah, who circumambulates the House at morn and eventide. O Qasim! Grieve not over the happenings of the world. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn thee with the ornament of detachment and trustworthiness, and to open before thy face the doors of grace and bounty. Verily, He is the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. He doeth what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nThe glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My loved ones and chosen ones! Blessed are ye! We testify that ye are among the triumphant ones in the Book of God, the Lord of Lords.\n\n=== END BH00039 ===\n\n=== START BH00040 ===\n\nPraised be His most sanctified and exalted Presence, immune from extinction and decline, Who hath brought forth the pearls of divine knowledge from the shells of the ocean of the hearts of the sincere ones and the monotheists, and made them manifest in the assemblage of the world, that eyes might be illumined by their vision and that these pearls might themselves guide humanity, leading all people and drawing them to the highest horizon. This blessed Day is in truth the Day of vision, for all that was created for it hath been made manifest. God willing, may heedless souls adorn themselves with the ornament of fairness, that perchance they may discover the fruit of their own creation and attain unto that for which they were created. Glory be to God! Any soul who hath attained even a measure of awareness standeth bewildered before the all-encompassing divine bounties and the manifestations of heavenly grace in these days. So completely have they encompassed all things that there is fear lest eyes become veiled from their true station. Praise be to God for having created us, taught us, caused us to know Him, and guided us unto Him on a Day wherein hearts were shaken and eyes were dazed. And may peace, salutations, glorification and splendor rest upon those who have arisen with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of creation, who have testified to that which God hath testified, and who have acted according to what was commanded in the Book. These are servants whom the affairs of creation have not kept back from the Truth, nor have the ornaments of the world, its commerce, conditions and manifestations diverted them from the remembrance of their Creator, their Fashioner and their Ordainer.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the Most Exalted Word through which Thou hast manifested whatsoever Thou didst desire, O Lord of all names, and by the light of the countenance of those near unto Thee, and by the rapture of the hearts of the sincere ones, to send down from the heaven of Thy grace upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and protect them from the oppression of such of Thy servants as have been kept back by transient things from the highest Paradise and from all that is with Thee, O Creator of the heavens!\n\nAnd then, once again was the power of consciousness perfumed by the breezes wafting from the flowers that had grown in the garden of your heart from the water of the loving-kindness of our Lord and your Lord. When the fragrance of your words attracted me, I turned to the Ancient King and appeared before His Most Great Throne and presented what was mentioned in your letter indicating your devotion, service and steadfastness. Then the Countenance of God turned and He, exalted be His glory, spoke thus:\n\nHe is the One dawning from the horizon of eternity\n\nGlorified is He Who hath revealed the Cause, sent down the verses, and guided the people to the path of righteousness. Observe how in the days when the Wronged One was imprisoned and afflicted at the hands of the enemies from both parties, when ranks were formed and thousands appeared, when ways were connected and news was unceasing, nevertheless did He raise the call with the most exalted voice and guide all on earth to the Truth, exalted be His glory. However, the heedless divines have become the cause of the people's negligence. They are the greatest veil and the august coverings mentioned. Soon shall the hand of divine power rend asunder these coverings and remove these veils from their midst, that all the world may turn to the highest horizon and receive their portion from the effulgences of the light of His countenance. Be thou speaking at all times. The pure seed that thou sowest in the good, blessed and fertile soil will assuredly grow and appear.\n\nO thou who gazest toward My horizon and art turned to My face! Be not grieved at the delay. Soon shall God manifest that which He hath purposed. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. The servant who is present hath come with thy letter and presented it before the Face, and We have revealed for thee verses that call out between earth and heaven of My grace and loving-kindness. Be thou grateful unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nWe have heard what thy tongue hath uttered in praise of this Wronged One, the Peerless. Thou wert remembered in the Most Great Prison and wert present when the Light was shining from Its luminous horizon. Remind the people in the days of thy Lord and give them the glad tidings of this News which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nSay: Beware lest the books of the world veil you from this Perspicuous Book. By God! The ocean of utterance hath surged and the Mother Book hath been sent down, and He Who conversed on Sinai hath come with that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Cast aside what the people possess. The Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the truth and calleth you to a station wherein the atoms have testified to the Revealer of verses, if ye be of them that know.\n\nO concourse of earth! How long will ye worship idols? Cast them behind you, turning unto the All-Informed, the Single One. Say: By God! Your idols are your divines who have broken God's Covenant and His Testament and turned away from Him Whom they invoke at all times. He who hath heard the Call and answered his Lord - he, verily, is the learned one in the estimation of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Through him the lips of utterance smiled throughout all possibility and the Nightingale sang upon the branches. Thus doth God exalt whomsoever He willeth through His grace, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.\n\nConvey My greetings and peace unto those who are with thee and unto those on whose faces thou seest the signs of humility before God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have clung to My luminous hem.\n\nThe heaven of grace hath spread its shade and the Tree of loving-kindness hath manifested its wondrous fruits. The Bestower, may His glory be exalted, and the partaker are both beloved, and the two blessed words \"well done\" and \"well pleased\" are the portion of this ephemeral one. God willing, may that beloved of the heart ever receive his portion from the wondrous, sublime bounties and attain unto this exalted, most high station. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nSome time ago, a very detailed letter containing divine verses and exalted, blessed Tablets was sent, according to thy wish, to his honor Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Naqi - upon him be the Glory of God - for delivery. God willing, it will have reached thee by now, though no word hath been received from thee. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, that wherever thou mayest be, thou mayest be verdant and flourishing through the spring rains of utterance.\n\nNews has arrived from the land of Sad. The signs of joy and gladness of that land have shone upon this land, and this matter is most beloved and blessed. Its blessedness will become more manifest with the passing of centuries and ages, day after day. And at first it was adorned with the permission of the Goal of all the worlds. Praise and gratitude be to God for His favors, bounties, grace and beneficence. They wrote of their arrival in the land of K and meeting with the friends. Praise be to God, all are recipients of the outpourings of the true Bestower. For some time the Ancient Tongue has been speaking these words in every place: \"O servant present, ask God to assist all to preserve what has been bestowed.\" The exaltation of the Cause is and has been beyond doubt. Should the entire world rise up in oppression and strive with the utmost diligence to extinguish the light of justice, ultimately the sun of justice will certainly emerge from behind the clouds. This is what God promised Us before this creation. In this case, it is incumbent upon all to preserve their ranks and stations in the name of Truth, lest the afflictions, trials, hardships and tribulations they have endured in the path of God be in vain. Verily our Lord is the All-Knowing Teacher.\n\nRegarding what they wrote about the arrival of Sheikh (upon him be 9 66 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]) who delivered the holy Tablets - the servant gives thanks to God for this and beseeches the Exalted Truth to give all to drink from the ocean of utterance and bestow their portion. Concerning what was written about Navvab (upon him be the Glory of God) and his wife regarding their intention to separate - there is no doubt the shortcoming was from the wife's side, however reconciliation is better, as holy souls before and after have been tried and maintained patience out of wisdom, and in this there is wisdom from God and a great reward. At Navvab's request, a special Tablet was previously bestowed upon him, but Navvab is protected from hardships by God's protection - He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. In both cases, whether reconciliation or separation, wisdom should be observed in every situation and time - this is closest to piety. This is a general ruling heard from the tongue of the Most Great Spirit. God willing, this servant himself will also send a letter to Navvab. Praise be to God, they are confirmed in service and steadfast in the Cause. Soon all these matters will be gathered and spread in the world's assemblage. Blessed is he who has attained to God's Cause and woe to the heedless.\n\nRegarding what was written about copper that Sheikh mentioned - you know that such matters have never been disclosed to anyone. In those days, when attention was sometimes directed to areas around the prison, considering that, this servant made the request so that both a service would be rendered by them and it would be useful for travel. This is a bounty from the Truth upon him. These matters are conditional upon their being carried out with the utmost joy and fragrance, meaning that no hardship should occur in sending it.\n\nRegarding what was written about the utmost eagerness of N.V. (upon him be the Glory of God) in rendering services - God willing, may he ever be successful in service and be manifest and evident like a banner upon the hills in the path of God.\n\nO Lion! God willing thou art assisted to service and amendment - thus was it ordained for thee in the Book from God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily We give thee glad tidings of My mercy, My favors and My grace, and We send Our greetings from this Station. We make mention of the Jafar whom thou didst name, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Lord of the Final Return. O Jafar! Woe unto every oppressor who hath oppressed, and light unto every oppressed one who hath shown patience in what befell him in the path of God, the Lord of all lords. Verily My oppression is My most glorious garment - I love to wear it at all times. By God's life! Soon all thou seest shall perish, but there shall endure for thee what hath befallen thee out of love for God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nWe make mention of My servant Hashim and give him glad tidings of this Most Great Remembrance through which the earth hath been illumined by the light of God, the Lord of all men. Grieve not at anything, but place thy trust in God. Verily He is with whosoever hath turned unto Him when mankind turned away. Had this world any worth, We would not have left it to every oppressive tyrant. God will soon seize them with His might, and will make manifest your stations before all the world - He is the Powerful, the Chosen One.\n\nO Lion! We have made mention of Jafar and Hashim, and We desire to make mention of My handmaiden who hath turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and believed when the handmaidens of the earth turned away. Thus doth the Lord of the world make mention unto thee - He with Whom is the Mother Book. Then know, O thou who art mentioned in My presence and who hath turned toward My horizon, that by the oppressors We meant the divines, not the rulers. By God's life! Through them was raised the edifice of tyranny and corruption appeared throughout all regions. Were it not for the divines, the rulers would not have opposed this Cause whereby God would assist them as He assisted them aforetime, and through which their sovereignty and power became manifest in the land. The kingdoms have need of order to protect them and justice to cultivate them. Thy Lord is verily the Expositor in truth and sincerity. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every heedless doubter. We send Our greetings from this Station upon thee and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned - and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nPraise be to God! The whole world hath partaken and continueth to partake of the living waters of the verses revealed from the Wellspring of divine utterance, which hath so encompassed all things that none hath the power to deny it. These deniers who are now visible are heedless; were they to be silent for but a moment and listen, all would be found submissive, humble, lowly, and remorseful. Mention was made of the oppressed ones of the land of Jasb. Observe now to what degree tyranny hath reached, that souls who day and night think only of removing from the world oppression, transgression, tyranny and whatsoever is unworthy of their station, are counted as oppressors, apostates and corrupters, and are afflicted with diverse trials. All these matters have proceeded and continue to proceed from the veils, the dark clouds, the tyranny and oppression of the turbaned ones. They have been and continue to be the source and origin of these heedless souls. Even as the lights of compassion, mercy and fairness shine forth from the Sun of Truth, so too doth the smoke of tyranny, oppression, error, malice and ignorance arise from those furnaces kindled with the firewood of rancor and hatred - and God is sufficient witness to this. Apart from these ignorant souls, none else was or is blameworthy in the first instance. God protect us and you from the evil of these people. However, the days of the oppressors have been and are numbered. Soon shall they receive the recompense of their deeds.\n\nMulla Ghulam-Rida and Muhammad-Javad, upon them be the glory of God and His mercy, are mentioned at the Most Holy Court in such wise that were it to be cast upon the graves, their inhabitants would arise. Blessed are they and blessed is he who remembereth them in what befell them in the path of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. The servant beseecheth his Lord to deliver them from the oppression of the oppressors and to grant them His presence or to inscribe for them from His Most Exalted Pen His reunion. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.\n\nConcerning the mention that was made of Aqa Muhammad-Husayn ibn ?-Q and Aqa Nasru'llah and Aqa Ghulam-'Ali and Aqa 'Ali son of his eminence Marfu', upon them be the glory of God, it was submitted at the Most Holy Court, and these exalted words were revealed from the heaven of bounties and favors. His words, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nHe is the Light from the Horizon of Revelation\n\nO Muhammad before ? and S! Thou hast attained unto the Most Great Word of God when the Mother Book turned toward thee from this Station at the mention of whose name the limbs of every treacherous one trembled and the face of every trustworthy one was illumined. We love him who hath loved the Face and make mention of him in such wise that his remembrance shall endure through the duration of My name in the kingdom of My mighty utterance. Be steadfast in the Cause with the most great steadfastness and strive that there may appear through thee that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: O people of the earth! Know ye that power and strength lie in steadfastness and unity. Hold fast unto them that your stations may be made manifest in the Kingdom and the signs of God may be spread abroad in the East of the earth and in its West. Verily your Lord, the All-Knowing, will aid you through His grace, and He is the All-Informed Teacher. Say: Hold fast unto that which God hath desired. By My life! Through it shall the doors of hearts be opened and ye shall behold mankind hastening unto God, the Mighty, the Praised. Give thanks unto God for this Most Great Tablet, whereunto nothing in the kingdom can be compared, as attesteth every discerning knower. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath attained unto this glorious and wondrous station.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur for his eminence Nasru'llah. His words, exalted be His dominion:\n\nIn My Name, the Compassionate, the Generous \\[...\\]\n\nGlorified is He Who hath sent down the verses and dispatched them unto him who hath believed in Him and His Book, when He came from the heaven of command with manifest sovereignty. He desired naught for Himself. He accepted the Most Great Prison and summoned all therein unto the supreme horizon and unto that which shall profit them in the world to come and the present one. Every discerning scholar beareth witness unto this. Blessed art thou, O Nasrullah, for having turned unto Him Who was wronged and having inhaled the fragrance of the Robe when every suspicious scholar turned away - they who cast the Book of God behind their backs, following their vain imaginings. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers. Blessed is the strong one whom the clamor of the divines hath not weakened, and blessed the eye which the veils of every heedless and remote one have not prevented. When thou hast attained unto My Tablet and found the fragrance of My utterance, render thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that whereby the station of man shall be exalted in the realm of possibility, and I am the All-Knowing Counselor. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having moved Thy Most Exalted Pen to make mention of me. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what lieth with Thee, for Thou art verily the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. At this point We make mention of My loved ones in that land and give them the glad-tidings of the spirit and sweet savors, inasmuch as the countenance of the All-Merciful hath turned toward them from this distant spot. Grieve not over what hath befallen you. By the life of God! Ere long the tongues of the world will speak your praise and acclaim, and curse your enemies. Thus doth inform you He with Whom is a perspicuous Book. Rejoice that the Lord of the Worlds maketh mention of you - He for Whose voice's hearing multitudes have died in yearning. He beareth witness Who speaketh in every condition that there is none other God but I, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who love Me and make mention of Me, and whom I have mentioned in such wise that its fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Ghulam-Qabli-'Ali. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn My Name, the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Glorious\n\nWe have made mention of thee before and after, and at this moment, O Ghulam-Qabli-'Ali. Thou art beneath the glances of thy Lord's loving-kindness. This is a word which no treasures can equal, wert thou of them that comprehend. Act in accordance with what We have commanded thee in the Book, that all who are endowed with vision may witness in thee the effects of what God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, hath willed. Grieve not over the world and its conditions. Rather, rejoice in this ocean which casteth upon thee the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Thy Lord is verily the Bestower, the Bountiful. Thus have We opened before thy face the door of grace with the key of My Name, the All-Powerful. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones in that land who have cast aside the way of the people, turning unto My straight Path.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. His mighty and glorious Word:\n\nIn My Name, the Forgiving, the Bountiful\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nO Ali! We have mentioned thee before with words from which mercy raineth down before the countenance of every discerning and insightful one. And We made mention of thy father, to whom My Most Exalted Pen hath testified concerning his faith, his devotion and his orientation when the Light was shining from the horizon of Baghdad. He was indeed the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. He attained the presence and drank the cup of reunion in the days of God, the Mighty, the Wise. How many a day did he circle round the House, and how many a night did he voice the praise of his Glorious Lord. And We made mention of his son, the Light, who heard with his own ear that which the Interlocutor of the Mount spoke forth in this wondrous Revelation. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he, and his brother, and his mother who heard and was blessed to hearken unto the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and who believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. And We made mention of My handmaiden who attained the presence and ascended to the Supreme Companion, the station whereby the eyes of those near unto God were solaced. We make mention of you and your descendants, and We counsel you to pure righteousness and to that which hath been sent down in the Book from the presence of an ancient Revealer.\n\nO Lion! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Give thanks, for We have mentioned every name that was in thy letter and have sent down lustrous words, each letter of which hath illumined the earth and heaven. Yet the people remain in evident veils. Give glad tidings to My loved ones and to those who have observed My covenant and My testament and have borne hardships in My path. They are under the glances of My loving-kindness and are mentioned in My Mighty Book.\n\nSome time ago, that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven was revealed specifically for his honor, the departed and accepted one, Kamaluddin, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy. God willing, may the true friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of bounty and who are gazing toward the horizon of the Cause hold fast to the cord of unity. God is witness and testifier that if what hath appeared and been revealed from the Source of the Cause were to be adhered to in every city and land, ere long the light of the Cause would appear with perfect radiance and brilliance and encompass all. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant success and triumph to all in accordance with His good-pleasure.\n\nA letter was also written by H.S., son of Sadiq, to the spiritual friend Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hassan, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, and was dispatched to the Most Holy Court. God willing, may they be speaking the praise of the All-Merciful at all times and be steadfast in His service. Another letter from that beloved one, dated the second of Dhi'l-Qa'dah, brought tidings and glad news, including mention of the Beloved of the worlds, that beloved one's arising to serve the Cause, mention of the divine friends, and the glad tidings of your esteemed being's health and well-being. It was as though each letter thereof appeared in human form and was inscribed on the right hand of these clear words: \"Blessed is he who hath perfumed Me and illumined Me with the light of the remembrance of the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\" God willing, may this messenger never cease to pass by and may his foot never stumble upon a stone.\n\nRegarding the envelope addressed to his eminence Aqa Siyyid Abu-?alib, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], according to instructions it should remain with your honor. It would be best to open it and make a copy, and there is no harm if you return it to its owner, but a copy should be taken so that it is not lost. The Blessed Tablet was revealed at the beginning of his imprisonment. This year most Tablets were delayed due to the disturbances in these parts. For example, the Tablets for the Land of M were revealed two years ago but until now, due to wisdom, were not sent. In these days, eleven of them were sent, so that the rest may be sent successively. It is hoped that all will attain.\n\nRegarding the piece you had written about, it has been written and is available here. Since no suitable bookbinder and illuminator can be found in this land, therefore what is fitting has not been accomplished. However, according to the principle that \"if the whole cannot be attained, the whole should not be abandoned,\" a temporary binding will be placed on it specifically for preservation. Otherwise, whatever that beloved one deems advisable, let it be done. However, if it is given in the same condition as it arrives, this would be closer to righteousness, as the signs of imprisonment are apparent and evident on it, and these blessed signs are in the path of the Friend.\n\nConcerning what they wrote about sending funds according to instructions to the mentioned souls, praise be to God Who enabled you to act according to His will. And regarding what they wrote about what they deemed advisable in the matter of N.J. and its components, it was appropriate and fitting. It is hoped that that beloved one will forever stand firm in service and be confirmed in assisting the oppressed.\n\nRegarding what was written about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Javad from the land of Naraq, upon him be the Glory of God - at first it caused infinite sadness, but when this servant reached the word of salvation, boundless joy appeared. I beseech God, exalted be His glory and station, to assist that beloved one in all matters. The aforementioned Aqa Muhammad-Javad attained the presence \\[of Baha'u'llah\\] in Iraq and dwelt in that land for a time, in days when the manifestations of power, the conditions of grandeur, the fragrances of verses, and the effulgences of the suns of evidence were witnessed in such wise that the walls, stones, and pebbles of Zawra were in a state of attraction, excitement, vibration and resurrection. After the migration, he and his brother were ever-remembered in the presence. Assuredly, these tribulations and afflictions that have befallen the friends of God will be followed by innumerable rewards and recompense. Consider the previous centuries: Jesus, Son of Mary - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - was summoned before an assembly with such humiliation as none but God knows, and now all kings remove their crowns in honor of His name, especially in these days when European governments have turned to religion and have arisen with complete determination to implement it. Although what has previously been revealed from the Supreme Pen will undoubtedly come to pass - some years ago a special Tablet was revealed for one of the friends wherein it was recorded that the face of the world is turning toward irreligion, and likewise some future events were inscribed therein - assuredly whatever is mentioned therein will appear in the world, and after the completion of the appointed time the Cause will be raised up in such wise that all will turn to it and approach with the utmost humility and submissiveness. In truth, however much this servant wishes to be brief and not cause trouble, it is observed that the choice is not in his hands - the attraction of friendship draws and carries one away to wherever God wills.\n\nConcerning what was written about Jinab-i-Aqa Mashhadi Husayn \\[Baha'u'llah\\] from Abadih and the actions of the opponents against him - this was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His glory: \"Excellent is what he has done who has turned to God, recognized Him, spoke and arose.\" May they ever be assisted in that which is the good-pleasure of God. O Asad! We have found from Abadih the fragrance of steadfastness to such a degree that were it to be divided among a thousand souls it would suffice them. Reflect on this bounty to which the Pen of the All-Merciful has testified. We, from this station, send Our greetings to My loved ones there and command them to that whereby the Cause of God is exalted, but with wisdom and utterance. They must teach the Cause with wisdom. Ere long the Word of God will be seen raised up in all directions, and this is what the All-Informed acquaints you with. End.\n\nThat concerning the passing of the honored and illustrious Haji Mirza Kamal'd-Din, upon him be the glory of God, Lord of the Day of Judgment, you have written - from this matter great joy was attained. Assuredly, whatever emanates from that spiritual beloved concerning the friends of God has been and continues to be put into effect. \"You have all arisen to serve God and serve His loved ones.\" This is a mighty station. He beseeches God, his Lord, to adorn your deeds with the seal of acceptance. Verily He has power over all things. Praise be to God that this prayer has been and continues to be adorned with the ornament of acceptance. I beseech and hope from the Exalted True One, glorified be His majesty, that He may assist Jinab-i-Aqa Nur and Jinab-i-Aqa Ali, upon them be the glory of God, and the other survivors of His Holiness Kamal, upon him and upon them be 96 \\[the glory of God\\], in that which is beneficial for them, and in all conditions may He not withhold from them the gaze of His favor. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous. And praise be to God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths.\n\nThe third letter from that beloved one, which was adorned with the date of 4th of Muharram al-Haram, clothed the form of sorrow with the ornament of joy. God willing, this new garment will not change and will always be observed with the freshness of youth.\n\nConcerning the mention of the receipt of the lost letter, praise and thanks be to God that once again it was not afflicted as before and remained preserved by divine protection. This evanescent servant has ever besought the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist him in mentioning and praising those near to His threshold. All atoms bear witness to this matter and behind them is our All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord.\n\nConcerning your mention of His Excellency and that some deemed it wise to rely on correspondence in affairs - this matter accords with wisdom, for often the enemies of His Excellency would have seized upon your association and would have departed from wisdom. Every soul has had and has both friend and foe, especially one of such an exalted station. That beloved one has truly acted with perfect wisdom in this regard. Consultation has been and will be a guide and is confirmed by the Holy Spirit. He has prospered who has turned toward it and lost who has turned away. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to increase His Excellency's confirmations through your confirmations and to grant the sealed wine. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Giver, the Munificent, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nIn these days, God willing, the Tablets will arrive. Since such favor has not been shown to anyone until now, therefore a complete effect must become manifest and they must be adorned with the ornament of love, which is considered the supreme ornament.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about His Excellency's movement being deemed wise that His Excellency should also move - this matter is surely acceptable and effective, for wherever they proceed, it has been and continues to be the cause of manifesting the fire of love and planting new saplings and growing the flowers of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about turning toward the land of N.J. - praise be to God that this journey increased the warmth of love, and likewise the illumination of vision. Turning toward God, speaking for God, and acting for God have been and continue to be effective, and no essence can equal its influence. God, our Lord, suffices as witness to what I say.\n\nAs regards what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, that he had given nineteen tumans as Huququ'llah to Her Holiness the Mother of the Sacred Household, upon her be the Glory of God and His favors, this was accepted before the Throne. Blessed is he in that he fulfilled and acted upon what was commanded in the Book of God, Lord of the worlds. And regarding what Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'r-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote to your honor mentioning the debt and hardship of certain ones, this matter was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. He says, exalted and mighty be He: \"O Lion! Upon thee be My Glory! All must trust in wisdom and cling to the means. Blessing will descend and hardship will be transformed into ease, and abundance will become manifest and evident. Verily thy Lord is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. Let them not be saddened by the severity of these days. By the life of God, great prosperity follows and supreme bounty hovers above. Soon will His grace descend in truth as a favor from His presence. Verily He is the Generous, the Forgiving. Convey My greetings to My servant 'Abdu'r-Rahim and give him the glad tidings of My turning toward him and My favor unto him, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones, and arise to mention God and His call and to teach His Cause, the Mighty, the Great, with wisdom and utterance. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" And We send greetings to My loved ones in all regions and We counsel them to love and unity and to that whereby the Cause will be uplifted among the servants. Thus have We commanded all before and at this time. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd regarding what they wrote that Jinab-i-Mir, upon him be the Glory of God, indicated that Jinab-i-Ustad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, owes twenty-nine tumans - this sum, according to the command, should be given from the Huquq to Jinab-i-Mir to pay his debts. Those souls who are enabled to perform this righteous deed will attain a great reward, and this servant will also send a receipt. Blessed is he whom God has enabled to serve Him in His days and has accepted what was done in His path, for the fragrance of a deed performed for His sake in the divine days remains and endures throughout the duration of His names and attributes. Blessed is he who has recognized and acted in the days of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nAs for what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and likewise his petition, after permission was granted, attained the hearing of the Beloved of the worlds, and these verses were revealed from the heaven of grace. He says, exalted be His grandeur and mighty be His power: \"He is the Hearer, the Answerer \\[...\\]\"\n\nO Mehdi! Upon thee be my glory! The servant present here hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One. We have found from it the fragrance of thy turning to the Most Exalted Horizon and thy orientation toward the Countenance after the passing of all things. We have heard the yearning of thy heart and the sighs of thy innermost being for that which passed thee by in the days of God, Lord of the Throne and earth, and Master of the last and the first. We answer thee with this Tablet, from whose horizon hath shone the sun of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Be thou assured by God's grace and mercy, and hold fast to wisdom and utterance and the teaching of His Cause, which hath been among the greatest of deeds. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to that which is with God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nHoly greetings and praise, sanctified from the affairs of service, do I convey to them. God willing, may they drink from the Euphrates of divine mercy which floweth and descendeth in the blessed divine verses. Every matter hath annihilation following it and change pursuing it, but the Word of God hath ever been and ever shall be abiding and eternal. Their tablet was revealed in a state where the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, was smiling and uttering these verses. God willing, may they be assisted to serve the Cause and make up for what they have missed.\n\nAs for what was written regarding Hakim Eliyahu, upon him be the glory of God, his petition was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence after the petition of Aqa Muhammad Mehdi, upon him be the glory of God. He, exalted and mighty be He, saith:\n\nIn My Name, the Manifest, the All-Knowing\n\nWe have heard thy call and seen thy letter. Thy cries and lamentations are like unto the cries and lamentations of those near ones and sincere ones, and thy call is the call of those who remember. God knoweth every branch and is aware of every matter. The fragrance of His garment hath been a spiritual herald, and He caused thee to attain unto Him. Thou didst reach Him and hear His call and drink from the Kawthar of His love. Preserve these stations through the name of the Glorious Lord. He hath heard the call of every wronged one and hath turned to every one who hath turned to Him. He is the Helper and He is the Succourer, He is the Powerful and He is the Mighty. Be thou assured by His grace and hold fast to His cord and cling to the hem of His generosity. Verily He is the Munificent, the Generous. At the end We counsel thee to patience and tranquility. All matters are suspended and connected to wisdom from God. Hold thou fast unto it and maintain calm and beautiful patience.\n\nGod willing, may they attain unto that which is the cause and means of salvation. This servant also conveyeth greetings and praise to them and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, for assistance and confirmation. Verily He is the Guardian of the doers of good.\n\nAs for what was written regarding Mulla Baqir 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] from the people of N and J, their petition was presented in the Most Holy Presence and attained the hearing of God, exalted be His glory, and a tablet was revealed from the heaven of will. God willing, may they attain unto it and drink from the Kawthar of inner meanings. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in reply. He said - may the spirit of all in the kingdom of command and creation be His sacrifice:\n\nIn My Name that dawneth from the Horizon of Command \\[...\\]\n\nO Baqir! All atoms are set in motion by the vibration of the Divine Word and are ablaze with the fire of His love. This is the Day wherein earth glorieth over heaven, inasmuch as it hath become the seat of God's Throne, and all its trees, leaves, fruits, stones and kernels are engaged in the glorification and praise of God. Yet mankind, though created specially for this Day, remain heedless and veiled from the Lord of Destiny. For years the earth hath found no rest. Each day a fresh calamity appeareth and a new turmoil ariseth, nor shall it find peace save through the command of Him Who is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. All things are imprisoned within the grasp of His might. This, verily, is easy for Him to accomplish. This is the word which was spoken aforetime. The deeds of the heedless servants are made manifest. That which hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen in God's Book is evident and visible, and that which hath not yet been manifested shall assuredly come to pass. This is an irrevocable decree from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.\n\nConsider the former generations and reflect how much oppression was visited upon the chosen ones of God. In all ages, the divines of the age were foremost in opposition, and through their opposition all turned away. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"They exchanged the grace of God for unbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition.\"\n\nO thou who gazest upon His countenance! Be not grieved by the oppression of the Wolf and his like. If bubbles upon the surface of water have their moment of stability, such souls too shall have their repose. Far, far from it! Soon shall all return to nothingness. Strive thou to be enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree - a fire which the seas of the world cannot quench, let alone this handful of dust.\n\nToday the Sun of bounty is shining and the Ocean of grace is surging. Beseech God to aid thee in that which shall endure as long as His Kingdom endureth. Thou didst mention submission and contentment. By God! Whosoever attaineth thereunto and drinketh from the ocean of contentment is recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. Well is it with him and joy be unto him! Thus did the Herald - may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake - proclaim: Strive ye all that perchance ye may attain unto the word of His good-pleasure. This is mentioned as the ultimate station with the Lord of all mankind. Whosoever today testifieth to that which God hath testified, and acteth according to that which is commanded in the Book - concerning such a one shall the word of His good-pleasure be sent down.\n\nAs to thy question concerning predestination and free will, in former years there hath been revealed from the realm of divine knowledge that which sufficeth all. And now, that which the Herald hath spoken - that Beloved One Who speaketh naught but the truth and in all conditions proclaimeth \"Verily I am God, there is no God but Me, the Lord of all things, and all else besides Me are My creation. O My creation! Worship ye Me.\" If thou wouldst ponder upon the manifestation of God's favor - exalted be His glory - and the sending down of this Tablet, thou wouldst become aware of the reality of that which thou hast asked. Yet today what is beloved is that ye arise to serve the Cause, for time is most precious, the Day most great, and the Cause most mighty. Were the fruit and effect of but one word of God's utterances to appear on earth, all would arise with their very souls to serve the All-Merciful. I have desired forgiveness from thy Lord. He hath, of a truth, forgiven thee through His grace, and taught thee that which draweth thee nigh unto Him. Be thou thankful for this great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of them that know Thee and Beloved of them that are near unto Thee.\n\nMay the honored one be assisted, arise in service, be engaged in remembrance, be silent when reading, be firm when needed, be articulate and steadfast. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations unto him.\n\nAs to what was written concerning Haji Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God (Baha'u'llah) and what befell him, it was presented before Him from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden. Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, exalted be His glory:\n\nO Asad! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His mercy. There hath befallen Haji that which hath caused grief to them that are nigh and sincere. Let them not be saddened. If perishable riches be taken from man, imperishable treasures are ordained for him with God. Regret is for wealth that is spent in ways other than the path of God; otherwise, that which is doomed to perish beseemeth them that perish. Beseech ye God that all may be enabled to discharge the rights of God, for thereby wealth becometh pure and blessed, and existence free and joyous. God willing, may all find the sweetness of the All-Merciful's utterance and the sweetness of deeds performed in His path. By My life! Whoso hath found it hath detached himself from all else. Thus hath flowed the stream of mercy from the tongue of thy Lord's wisdom, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Convey My greetings to My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of My grace and mercy, and remind them of that which hath been revealed in My perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd concerning what thou didst write about Aqa Rahim of N.J., upon him be the Glory of God, and his intention to pay the rights of God - may he, in all conditions, gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and act according to that which God hath revealed in the Book. Mention of him attained the presence of the Most High and these exalted words were revealed from the heaven of mercy, exalted and mighty be His Word:\n\nO Asad! Upon thee be My Glory. Make mention of Rahim on My behalf. We have remembered and do remember all who have turned unto God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. There is none, whether great or small, for whom My Most Exalted Pen hath not revealed that which cooleth the eyes. Ask God to assist Rahim in His remembrance, praise, service to His Cause, and the discharge of what is incumbent upon him regarding the rights of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. By God's life! All that the world possesseth cannot equal one word from thy Lord's utterances. To this testifieth His Book Preserved and His Decree Irrevocable.\n\nO My servant! Remember Me before the break of each day with this sublime Word:\n\nLord! Deliver me from my will and desire and adorn me with what Thou willeth and desirest. Assist me thereafter to arise in Thy service and to serve Thy Cause with the power of Thy sovereignty. I testify to my impotence and to Thy might, to my weakness and to Thy power. Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.\n\nTwo other souls were mentioned. God willing, may all attain His grace and act in accordance with what He loves and is pleased with. His Holiness Afnan (may the Most Glorious Glory be upon him) wrote regarding the matter of Aqa Rahim as per your letter to this servant. As commanded, nine tumans from the available funds should be sent from the Land of Qaf to Jinab-i-Samandar (may the Glory of God be upon him) to be delivered to Mulla 'Abdu'l-Husayn (may the Glory of God be upon him) and a receipt obtained.\n\nAnother matter: As per the blessed Command, consider the case of the sister of Sultanu'sh-Shuhada (may the Glory of God be upon them both). Her rights, with whomever they may lie, must be delivered to her. Her petitions have repeatedly reached the Most Holy Court and one Tablet was revealed and sent in response to her supplications.\n\nRegarding the turning toward the Most Holy Court by the Names of the Unity, after the Master of Names heard this, this supreme word was revealed from the Kingdom of Will - His blessed and exalted Word: \"If it occurs with spirit and fragrance, there is no harm. And if truly the lack of turning toward the Blessed Kaaba causes clamor among the deniers, they may turn in such wise that the pebbles of the earth and the fish of the sea join in their praise. Thus it behooveth everyone who desireth God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed are they and those whom God hath made worthy of this noble station.\" However, it was repeatedly stated that if not turning causes objection, then pausing in these matters is preferable, for perhaps souls may be quickened and enabled to serve the Cause. Today, holding fast to that which exalteth the Cause before God is \\[most\\] great. He recordeth for whosoever desireth the reward of meeting Him, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nRegarding what was written about the handmaiden of God, the wife of Aqa Muhammad Hashim Mishki-baf (may the Glory of God be upon them both), it was submitted to the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed for her from our All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord. His exalted Word:\n\n\"O My handmaiden! Remember thy Lord with these sublime words:\n\nGlory be unto Thee! In Thy grasp is my forelock and the reins of the affairs of Thy servants. I beseech Thee by the handmaiden who melted in separation and remoteness from Thee to ordain for me by the Pen of Thy Will that which will preserve me beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy grace. O Lord! The atoms have testified to Thy generosity, bounty and favors, and all created things to Thy knowledge, wisdom and all-encompassing power. I beseech Thee to send down from the heaven of Thy Will that which will deliver me from my will and desire and benefit me in all Thy worlds. O Lord! Thou art nearer to Thy servants and handmaidens than their own selves, and more knowing of what is with them and what benefiteth them. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nAnd regarding the mention of Aqa Siyyid Baqir (may the Glory of God be upon him), this is what was revealed for him from the heaven of grace - His Word, great is His grandeur:\n\nHe is the Ruler over what He willeth \\[...\\]\n\nA mention from Us to the one who desired to be remembered in the Most Great Prison, that his name might be honored through attaining the presence of the Wronged One, Who hath come from the heaven of Command with the hosts of ordinances and laws. Blessed is he who hath beheld My horizon, heard My call, desired My remembrance and attained unto My Word. He is indeed of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Baqir! He who arose to serve Me made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with a remembrance that, were it to be cast upon the mountain, would cause it to soar with longing for the meeting with God, the Lord of lords. Cast aside what the people possess and take what is with thy Lord, the Master of mankind. Thus have We remembered thee and revealed for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Beware lest the affairs of the world sadden thee or the veils of those who dispute the signs prevent thee. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon those who have held fast to the Sure Handle when the All-Merciful came with power and sovereignty.\n\nO Lion! O thou who hast drunk the choice wine of My utterance and turned thy face toward My countenance! No name was presented before the Face but that We mentioned it as a bounty from thy Lord, the Generous. The mention of all is remembered in the Most Holy Court and divine verses have been specifically revealed for all, and even those souls whose names have not outwardly been honored by being heard, their mention too hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We have mentioned him and do mention him that it may be for him a remembrance, a treasure, an honor and a store with God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily, He loveth him who loveth Him and remembereth him who uttereth His beautiful praise. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have embarked upon the Crimson Ark through this wondrous Name.\n\nO 'Ali! We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee as a bounty from Us, and We have heard thy call and have answered thee in truth, and We are the Answerer. Rejoice in that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison with a loving-kindness whose station none knoweth save the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My Most Great Word, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause in this Day wherein the Ancient Beauty and the Most Great Name calleth out with a call that hath enraptured the hearts of those who have recognized. Cast aside what the people possess and take what hath come to thee from God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the affairs of creation prevent thee from the Truth. Leave the people and what they possess behind thee, turning toward the Supreme Horizon, the station from which the light hath shone forth through this wondrous Name. The glory that is manifest and resplendent from the kingdom of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nIn My Name, through which the ocean of life hath surged \\[...\\]\n\nThis Book hath been sent down in truth from God, the Lord of all worlds. We make mention therein of him who hath turned unto the Countenance, that it may be unto him an everlasting treasure with his Lord, the Protector, the Trustworthy. O Jim-'Ayn! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the direction of Truth, and calleth thee to the Most Exalted Horizon, and guideth thee unto His Straight Path. Blessed art thou for having inhaled the fragrance of My raiment, and turned thy face toward My countenance, and heard My wondrous Call. Be thou in all conditions firm in thy grasp of the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness, and put thy trust in Him. He, verily, is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Grieve thou not over anything. The Most Great Joy hath appeared, for God hath come with His manifest Command. Blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancies and taken hold of that which hath come unto him from God, the Single, the All-Wise. Thus hath the fragrance of the Merciful's utterance been wafted throughout all contingent being. Blessed is he who hath found it, and woe unto the heedless. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother who hath heard the Call and turned unto it, and upon every maidservant who hath attained unto the recognition of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. This concludeth what hath come from His bounty. Who else can reckon His bestowals or render Him proper thanks? All existence hath confessed its powerlessness, its poverty, its inadequacy and its evanescence, and hath acknowledged that He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nThe changing of names is not permitted at present, though afterward the matter resteth in His hands. Their occupation is well-pleasing at the Divine Threshold. A change of intention is necessary, and praise be to God, they have succeeded in this.\n\nEight pieces were sent, two of them practice pieces and evening exercises, and six others in clear script. Fifteen other pages were bound for safekeeping and all were dispatched. Let them act as they deem advisable. We beseech God to aid His servants to recognize that for which they were created. He, verily, hath power over all things.\n\nTo the honored leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, His favor and His grace, we convey greetings and salutations. God willing, whatever was neglected before shall now be undertaken. It is hoped that from what hath transpired, perfect results shall become manifest. Verily, all authority is within the grasp of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the kingdom of Command and Creation. The Glory, manifest, resplendent, shining forth from the direction of the prison of our Lord and our Goal and your Goal, be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have attained unto this Manifest Announcement.\n\nIn Rabi'u'th-Thani 1300\n\n=== END BH00040 ===\n\n=== START BH00041 ===\n\nPraise be to God Who is sanctified in His Glory, unique in His Majesty, exalted above weariness, and holy beyond all hopes! He it is Who has ordained the terms for all lives, Who speaks from all eternity, and Who is manifest in the end. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nAnd praise be to God Who has accepted the deeds of those who were attracted by His call, who were intoxicated by the wine of His revelation, who were made to speak His praise, who recognized the Sun of His Beauty, who were made manifest in His days, who were aided to know His Self, and who were enabled to achieve His good-pleasure. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful.\n\nPraise be to God Who illumined the horizon of the world with the Most Great Light. When He was established upon the throne, He gave glad tidings to the people of the manifestation of the ocean of His favors and the suns of His grace. Blessed is he who, being steadfast, cast away that which held him back and hastened to His most exalted horizon. Woe unto him who hesitated because he followed the vain imaginings of those who appeared in the guise of men.\n\nI glorify, pray, and send greetings upon those whom vain desires have not kept back from God, the Lord of Names. Through them the star of divine knowledge has shone forth in most lands. They are honored servants, they are working servants, they are near servants, they are sincere servants, they are triumphant servants, they are servants who stand firm in the service of their Lord, and they are they who speak with wisdom and utterance amongst the servants.\n\nI testify that they have attained unto the Kawthar of life which flows from the right hand of the throne of the All-Merciful, and they have achieved that which none before them has achieved. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Bountiful.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness and your constancy! I was sitting silent, contemplating the Cause of God and what had befallen it from His servants, when one of the loved ones of God brought your letter. When I opened it, I found the fragrance of your love for our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the world, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. I read it and understood what was in it concerning your service, your steadfastness, your praise, and what you have borne in the path of God.\n\nThereafter, I approached the Most Exalted Station, the seat of the throne of our Most Glorious Lord. When I entered and found myself before His presence, I presented that wherewith you had called upon God. Then the Beloved smiled and said: \"He has no merit in this. We aided him to remember Me, so he remembered Me. We caused him to know My horizon, so he turned to My face. We enabled him to serve Me, so he arose to serve by My leave. All bounty belongs to My Self, and I am the Ancient Bestower. Were it not for the outpourings of the ocean of My grace, he would not have known Me, and were it not for the attraction of My verses from the kingdom of My utterance, he would not have turned to My path.\"\n\nO My Name \"Beauty\"! Reflect upon the kings and that which We have revealed unto thee, that thou mayest comprehend what thy Wise Lord hath spoken. Verily, one of the kings was immersed in the seas of dominion and attached to the world and its ornaments and colors. On one of the nights, the sun of detachment dawned upon him from the horizon of My will, and We unveiled him. He abandoned all that he possessed and went forth from his house, turning toward the wilderness, and none knew of this save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. And were We to unveil to the people as We have unveiled to thee, they would all arise to serve Me and to remember Me and praise Me. Thus hath My tongue spoken that thou mayest be among the joyous ones. Verily, thy Lord loves jest at times.\n\nThus did My tongue speak, that thou mayest be among those who rejoice. Verily thy Lord loveth jesting at times and doth jest. He, verily, doeth what He willeth. None can object to that which proceedeth from Him. The Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, bear witness to this.\n\nAs to what thou didst manifest of the signs of powerlessness and nothingness, and confession of sins and shortcomings, He said: \"O My Name! We have forgiven thee aforetime and accepted thy service, thy obedience, thy presence, thy meeting with Us, and We have heard thy yearning, thy sighing, thy cry, thy lamentation and the sighings of thy heart in thy love for God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\"\n\nAnd concerning what thou didst write that this error of turning towards the land of Kha added to previous errors, after this was presented, the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance that which none among the people of creation can comprehend. By thy life! The pens of the world are powerless to describe it, nor can the hearts of the mystics grasp it. At the end of the utterance He said: Write in the name of the Beauty, upon Him be the Glory of God, that this service was and shall be accepted, for His Honor the Name of Ha, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote to you, and We testify that he is among those who have been set ablaze with the fire of the love of God and was immersed in the ocean of His grace, and in such a state, when he heard what occurred in the Prison Land, he cried out within himself and informed the people of what had appeared. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou assured that We have accepted what thou hast done in the path of God, and be thou of the thankful ones. Verily the rain of grace from the heaven of My bounty hath been directed toward thee, and the glances of My mercy have been fixed upon thy love. Remember thy Lord in all conditions with wisdom and utterance. He verily heareth and seeth. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nO Beauty! Some souls are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon and, with utmost longing, yearning, attraction and enkindlement in the divine path, they hold nothing back and take precedence in service to the Cause. These are the people of Baha in My crimson Book. And some have not yet reached this exalted, most high station, therefore they are not protected from the promptings of their hearts. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing.\n\nThus when the aforementioned news reached the Holy Land, the Command shone forth from the Source of Command and the decree of prohibition descended from the heaven of divine Will. Among these was the command to Jawad, upon him be the Glory of God, who circumambulates, to write to the land of Ta and Qaf that no one should request anything. Similarly, His Honor the Name of Ha, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory from God, was commanded regarding the lands of Kha and Kaf and Ta. This decree of prohibition was not specific to the land of Kha. Perfect bounty hath appeared from the Dawning-Place of favors toward the loved ones of that land. Verses have been revealed for them before, which if anyone should read them, they would discover God's grace and mercy toward them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed.\n\nThere hath been and is no doubt that every one of the aforementioned souls who arose to serve, did so for God and acted in the path of God. Therefore their deeds are surely accepted and their reward is inscribed with God by the Most Exalted Pen. They must be occupied with the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds with utmost joy and gladness. We glorify their faces and make mention of them in such wise that their names shall endure in the material world and in My wondrous Kingdom.\n\nThis servant submits that this imperative matter was revealed at a time when the names of those who had succeeded in serving the Cause were not, in appearance, mentioned in the Most Holy Presence, and after the mention of souls it was accepted, and concerning whatever funds had been received, it was commanded that they be distributed among certain loved ones of God who dwelt in that land. And the details of distribution were sent, according to the command, by Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-'Ali of Qa'in - upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. Care must be taken lest it become a cause of distress to accepted souls, for all are honored in the sight of God. Today, whosoever hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon hath been and is the recipient of perfect grace, for mighty is this Cause. We beseech God - exalted and glorified be He - to adorn all with the raiment of steadfastness and to give them to drink, at all times, of the most pure wine. Verily, He is the Munificent Giver.\n\nIt is entirely clear and evident that from the time the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed from the heaven of God's Will, it remained concealed for several years, until certain accepted and assured souls from various regions asked about the divine laws and made their earnest and humble petition. Therefore the command to send forth the Kitab-i-Aqdas was given, and it was ordained that none should demand the Huququ'llah, this matter being contingent upon the willingness of the souls themselves. This continued until the years culminated in the previous year, when the command was issued from the Source of Authority that whosoever wished to pay the Huququ'llah, it should be accepted from them. And in truth, this too is a great bounty for the servants, as it is the cause of purification and divine blessing and grace. Blessed is he who doeth what hath been commanded in the Book.\n\nAlthough it is known that your honor hath acted with perfect wisdom and detachment, and not a word contrary to the command hath proceeded from you, yet since you were specifically determined in this matter, therefore the command of prohibition was revealed, for some people are weak. Otherwise, by God, besides Whom there is none other God, your deed was and shall ever be accepted and your effort appreciated. One day these words were heard from the blessed tongue: \"O servant who standeth before the Throne! We have created all for My service and My days, for the triumph of My Cause, the recognition of My Self, the turning unto My face, and presence before the gate of My mercy. And what they possess was but a drop from the ocean of My bounty. Were you to seek from them what I have bestowed upon them through My grace, you would find them different from what you had previously observed. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nAnd likewise in Persian He said - though this servant is not capable of recounting all that was heard from the Kingdom of Utterance, yet what remaineth in mind shall be mentioned - He said: \"Although the entire world is from God, and all acknowledge and confess this, and whatever hath been given to the people of the earth hath been from the bounties of the ocean of His grace, nevertheless, if they were commanded to spend what they possess, you would surely find some deficient and hesitant, while others, through the effulgences of the lights of detachment, have attained to such a station that they have spent with utmost love and sincerity in the path of God whatsoever they possessed. This too hath been witnessed.\" End.\n\nThe wish of this evanescent servant is that such arrangement be made that the people of the land of Kha be not saddened, but rather be adorned with the ornament of joy in the name of God, for this is beloved in the sight of God, inasmuch as the perfection of divine favors toward the friends is manifest and evident from the horizon of grace. And concerning what was written about the aforementioned one who sent a gift to your honor and expressed his desire to render service - God willing his service has been accepted. In any case, arrange matters in such wise that none may be saddened. Any matter wherein both the negation and affirmation thereof are for God's sake is assuredly beloved. No grief shall then remain for anyone in this regard. This much is submitted: that this journey of yours was for God, and all deeds are manifest and evident before the Truth.\n\nAnd concerning what you wrote about having written to the land of Kha according to instructions that it was not accepted, they said this word would cause grief, for they would think they are not acceptable in the sight of God. Arrangements should be made that all may know that the glance of favor hath been and, God willing, will continue to be directed towards them. This is the end of that matter, and the reason is what was submitted before. God willing, may all be gladdened by and attain unto divine favors.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about some of those souls having given funds as Huququ'llah, they said: \"Excellent is what they have done, for the Huquq is a word which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book.\" It is incumbent upon all to be mindful thereof and act accordingly. However, since what transpired outwardly gave rise to other impressions among some of the weak ones, therefore the decree of prohibition was sent down from the heaven of command. Verily, He is the Ruler, the All-Choosing.\n\nO My Name \"Jamal\"! We have answered thee out of My grace, and We love thee through My all-compelling favor that surroundeth the world. We behold those whom God hath adorned in the land of Kha with the ornament of humility, submissiveness and sincerity. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. They are those who have attained unto the wine of revelation and have been intoxicated by the living waters of thy Lord's bountiful favor. We hear and see those who make mention of Me and act in My straight Path. Nothing whatsoever escapeth thy Lord's knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily those who soar in My atmosphere and act as bidden in My path shall soon find themselves in stations which the tongues of speakers are powerless to describe. We send Our greetings from this Most Exalted Station, which hath been named 'the Most Great Prison' in the Book of Names, to the faces of those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds, and have acknowledged and recognized what He hath sent down from the heaven of grace. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Giving, the Ancient of Days. We beseech God to assist them to remain firm with great steadfastness, lest their feet slip from what is mentioned in creation and from the cawing of the cawers.\n\nHere endeth the response to your honored letter which you sent from Yazd, answered point by point. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThe second holograph of that eminent one, which was inscribed from the land of Sad, arrived when this lowly servant was outside the city. God knoweth that I opened and read it, finding it adorned, embellished, honored, blessed, and perfumed with the remembrance of God, my Beloved and your Beloved, my Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all the worlds. God, exalted and mighty be He, is my witness that this servant, beholding the enkindled fire that blazed forth from divine love in that noble one's breast, read it time and again. Later, at a special hour, it was presented before the Throne. Verily my Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Thereupon the Ancient Beauty turned toward the servant and said, exalted be His grandeur and majesty: \"We have heard the mention of My name, his call, and his supplication, and We have seen his turning and his entreaty, and verily We kindle the fire of My love in his breast, for I am the Almighty, the Powerful. O My Name! Sorrows have overtaken Me to such extent that were I to tell thee of them, thou wouldst weep as those who are bereft. There hath appeared in this land that which should not appear in the days of God and His Manifestation, and I am the Wronged, the Lonely One. We have made the prison-land a garden among gardens, sent down blessings therein, and released the path of those who were in a mighty fortress, and opened the gate of the City that whoso willeth may go forth and whoso desireth may enter therein. But when that which appeared appeared, they found themselves in manifest straits. Grieve thou not over anything, for thy Lord, though encompassed by sorrows, is in great joy. Give glad tidings to those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon with My remembrance, and greet their faces on My behalf, for I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. We make mention of those who have believed in God throughout the nights and days. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings unto all who are related to thee, male and female, young and old.\" And when the final passages of that noble one's supplication, which indicated the arrival of the Most Mighty Tablet and expressed joy, delight, gratitude and praise, were presented, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke again: \"O My Name! We saw thee immersed in the ocean of contentment. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this noble station. Be thou in all conditions as thou hast been. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen counsel thee in this mighty prison.\"\n\nAnd concerning what thou didst mention about the Tablet of Mulla 'Ali-Jan, upon him be the Glory of God, it is indeed exactly as thou hast written. Such matters caused the heavenly sustenance to be cut off, such that for a time the Most Exalted Pen was stilled. O beloved of my heart! If the servants would act in accordance with what they have been commanded by the Lord of Creation, by thy life, thou wouldst see the world transformed beyond recognition - nay, even more than what that eminent one hath written. Indeed, at one time the Ancient Tongue, addressing the servant, said that some of the divine Tablets which were revealed from the heaven of will as pure bounty now lie buried beneath the earth - one who had possession of them concealed them out of fear, and some gave tablets to others who gave them to still others. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing.\n\nFrom this blessed word it is evident that many unacceptable deeds have occurred regarding the matter of the Tablets. We must all - you, this servant, and all the friends - beseech the True One, glorified and exalted be He, and with the utmost humility and need implore and supplicate that He may adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness, trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness. By Him Who has caused all things to speak forth His Most Great, Most Glorious Name! Had they acted upon the divine counsels of the All-Merciful, now would the Sun of the Divine Word be seen rising and manifest from every city, and dawning and visible from every horizon. The matter is finished, and it behooveth the tongue to maintain evident silence. God willing, through the grace and favor of the True One, it is foreseen that all who drink from the Kawthar of reality will become so enkindled with the fire of love that naught shall remain save oneness and unity, until all speak with one tongue and act with one hand. If the prayers of this servant are not answered due to the seas of disobedience, it is hoped that the prayers of that honored one and the other friends will be accepted before God. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, He is the Generous, He is the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.\n\nAnother matter: Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, wrote to this servant that someone from Mazandaran has come here and desires to go to the Most Holy Court. When this was presented at the Threshold of the Throne, a special Tablet was revealed in these days for Mulla 'Ali-Jan, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise concerning that person mighty and exalted verses were revealed from the heaven of God's will and sent forth. And it was specifically commanded that the bearer should bring the special Tablet to you, and after your perusal deliver this exalted Tablet to its owner.\n\nAnd another matter: At one time They commanded: Write to the one bearing the name of Beauty that prolonged stay in any place is not necessary. Rather, like the morning star, thou must rise from the horizon of every land so that some of the friends who have grown cold may become enkindled with the fire of divine love. Just as food is necessary for bodies, likewise for spirits it is essential. The food of the spirit is the exalted, delicate, fresh heavenly sustenance that hath been sent down from the heaven of divine favor. If the food of the spirit reacheth it not, it will surely grow weak. Therefore, from time to time, with perfect wisdom, turn to various regions for the purpose of teaching. What is necessary and essential is the remembrance of receptive souls, so that all may, through divine assistance, attain to the ornament of steadfastness, trustworthiness, truthfulness, and that whereby God's Cause is exalted. In these days a Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all beings concerning detachment and its station. It is mentioned here that perchance it may be the cause of the purification of souls. We beseech the True One, glorified and exalted be He, that He may cause all to drink of this wine and attain unto this most glorious and most exalted station. And whosoever attaineth unto the ornament of detachment will assuredly be observed to be trustworthy, truthful and steadfast. O how wonderful is this most pure station! O how wonderful is this most luminous station! O how wonderful is this most resplendent station! And O how wonderful is this most exalted station! This is a copy of what God hath revealed in the Book.\n\nIn My Name, the Book \\[...\\]\n\nWhen the sun of detachment dawns from the horizon of the heaven of any soul, the fire of desire and craving is quenched therein. Thus doth He Who is the Lord of all men inform you, did ye but know it. He whose sight is illumined by the light of understanding will assuredly detach himself from the world and all that is therein. Unto this beareth witness thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in this exalted and glorious station. Consider, then remember Nu'man who was among the most exalted of kings, and before him another from among creation. When the sun of detachment dawned upon their hearts, they forsook all they possessed and went forth into the wilderness, and none knew of them save God, the All-Knowing. Verily, Nu'man was seated upon the throne of sovereignty when We caused him to hear one of My most exalted words. He was stirred, pondered, was amazed, then arose and addressed himself, saying: \"There is no good in what thou dost possess today, for tomorrow another shall possess it.\" Thus did We awaken him, and verily I am the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When morning breathed and the sun rose, the nobles found the throne abandoned. They were bewildered and searched throughout the realm until they despaired of that which they sought. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By God! Were We to lift the veil from eyes as We lifted it from his, thou wouldst witness the people forsaking the world behind them and abandoning that which withholdeth them from this luminous horizon. Blessed is he who is illumined by the lights of detachment; he is, before God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, of the people of the Crimson Ark. Blessed is the city from whose horizon the sun of detachment hath dawned, and the land that hath been illumined by its lights. By My life! Had these regions been blessed by a ray of its dawning light, Baha would not have suffered among His enemies. Thus doth the Lord of Names recount unto thee that thou mayest be of them that know. Were I to tell thee what hath befallen the Wronged One, thou wouldst weep and lament as do they who have lost their loved ones \\[...\\]\n\nNow if a soul were to observe this Tablet with outward eyes, solely for the sake of God, and ponder upon it, he would discover that which would profit him and illumine the world. O thou beloved of my heart! Most people have been reared in the school of ignorance and wander in the wilderness of falsehood and hypocrisy. Where is the seeing eye and where is the hearing ear? Where are the penetrating visions and the attentive ears? He who martyred the Third Letter of the Living who believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest - as attested by the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for His sake - through tyranny and aggression, and likewise the one who accompanied him from Persia to Iraq, and others - each one of whom he condemned to death on some pretext - yet he wrote that they are killing holy souls and forcibly seeking leadership. Consider how he did not count the Third Letter among the holy souls, and as for Aqa Jan known as Kaj-Kulah - God the One is witness that the people of this land cried out because of his reprehensible deeds - let them inquire in Persia, Istanbul, Damascus and this place until the truth becomes known about this person who has been made one of the holy souls in service to that imaginary person. And that great person you mentioned to whom that imaginary one wrote a letter - it would be well to ask him about the details of Aqa Jan, for Aqa Jan's sister was in the household of Navvab Firidun Mirza, and among the holy souls of that imaginary one was Rida-Quli, about whom you yourself know that his brother said in your presence that \"my lack of belief is due to the kind of belief that my brother Rida-Quli claims, for I know him better and am more aware of his deeds, yet I see that he considers himself one of the chosen ones of this Cause.\" The other details about him are known to you, and you are aware of why he was banished from the Most Holy Court, and if he was a follower of Yahya, what was he doing in Akka? By God, besides Whom there is none other God, such things proceeded from him and his sister as caused the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament. These are among those whom whoever has seen them has testified to their falsehood and hypocrisy. They are they who cast aside God's Cause and His laws, and followed what their desires commanded them - to this beareth witness what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. By thy life, eyes have shed tears because of their deeds and hearts have melted at the oppression they have wrought against God's Cause and His envoys - to this beareth witness everyone adorned with the robe of justice. How desirable it would be for someone to ask His Excellency Mushiru'd-Dawlih about the reason for Siyyid Muhammad's going to Istanbul, so that it might become clear to every person of insight how much these imaginary liars have caused the Cause of God to be wasted. Beyond all this, you yourself are aware that no one associated with those souls. For several months the Ancient Beauty had ceased associating with anyone, the door was closed and attainment to His presence was forbidden, and in those days occurred what occurred. The servant beseecheth his Lord to make known to the servants what He possesseth and to guide them to His straight path.\n\nUp to this point is the reply to your letter which you had sent from the land of Sad, and an answer was submitted several months ago. However, since it was lengthy and contained various subjects and statements, and circumstances were unsettled, it was not sent. Until today, which is the fifth day of the blessed month of Ramadan, it remained delayed and postponed until recently when your other letter, which you had written outside the land of Ta, namely at Imamzadeh Hasan, became the cause of joy and gladness to the heart. After perusal, it was presented to the Most Holy Court, all of it was submitted. He says, exalted be His grandeur and His glory \\[...\\]\n\nO Jamal! At times we behold thee in manifest joy, and at other times in a sorrow that saddeneth the hearts of the sincere ones. If thou hast attained unto supreme joy, what meaning can sorrow have, and if thou art truly certain of the evanescence of the world and aware of the spreading of the divine carpet, for what purpose dost thou mention contraction? O My Name \"The Beauty\"! Knowest thou Who speaketh unto thee? He is the One for Whose call Moses sacrificed his spirit, for Whose meeting the Beloved offered up his life, and for the fragrance of Whose raiment the Spirit laid down his life. Can sorrows remain with thee after these utterances which have streamed forth from the fountains of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate? We bear witness that thou art among them that have attained, that thou art among the assured ones, and that thou art among them that are well-informed.\n\nO Jamal! First, in these days when the sea of joy is surging and the winds of gladness are blowing due to the appearance of the Manifestation of Revelation, it behooveth not the souls who have accepted and remained steadfast to make mention of sorrows, except in regard to tribulations that pertain to the Cause of God. And since thy sorrows have been of this nature, there is no harm in this. However, thy sorrows shall be transformed into joy through the bounties of the Beloved, for He is the Comforter, and He is the Consoler. But what is to be done about the tribulations that have befallen the Wronged One? Is there any comforter to comfort Him, or any consoler to console Him in what hath come upon Him? Nay, by His Self, the All-Subduing over the worlds! O Jamal! The mention of the sorrows of the Beloved of all possibility containeth an ocean of solace. Well is it with them that understand.\n\nThe elaboration of this matter is not timely at present, as the servant is present and desireth that thy letter be presented point by point and answers be revealed from the Kingdom of utterance, that perchance these answers may, like the water of life, flow through the bodies of all contingent beings and enable all to inhale the fragrances of the days of God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Jamal! Ever remember the loved ones who have turned unto the horizon of the All-Merciful and have quaffed the choice wine of mystical knowledge from the Beloved of all possibility, that all may manifest such virtuous and goodly characteristics as shall cause the exaltation of God's Cause. O Jamal! Had the land of the Prison been adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, the Beloved of the world would not have been observed to be sorrowful. You must call the friends to trustworthiness and truthfulness, that they may attain unto these two greatest luminaries which have shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's commandments.\n\nIn one of the Persian Tablets this word hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will: \"Today befitting deeds are needed and praiseworthy actions are meet. Every goodly deed is in itself a promoter of the Cause.\" The witness to this utterance are the words that have been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in other Tablets. If today a soul be adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, it is more beloved in the sight of God than one who would journey on foot toward the Most Holy Court and attain the presence of the Worshipped One at the glorified station. Trustworthiness is to the city of humanity as a fortress, and to the temple of man as the eye. Whoso is deprived of it shall be recorded and accounted as blind in the presence of the Divine Throne, even though in keenness of sight he be like Zarqa of Yamamih.\n\nO Jamal! Be confident in the divine favors and arise to serve the Cause in such wise that neither the happenings of time nor the perturbations of the contingent world may prevent thee from serving the Beloved of the worlds. Yea, perturbation is one of human characteristics and in every case it seizeth man.\n\nBe not deterred by the troubles of contingent existence from serving the Well-Beloved of all worlds. Indeed, trouble is among human traits and in every case it seizes man and makes him despondent, yet upon holy souls it has not had, nor does it have, complete effect. The body may be sorrowful, but the spirit dwells in joy and fragrance, even as the Son of Mary said: \"The body is sorrowful but the spirit is in delight and gladness.\" O Jamal, count this mention as great, for the rain of the All-Merciful's mercy has showered upon thee from the heaven of bounty. Be thou grateful and be among the thankful ones. Be thou grateful and be among those who praise.\n\nIt behooveth not this evanescent servant to submit any word, for the King of Words hath made mention of that exalted one, and the Sovereign of Meanings hath ascended the throne of bounty. O beloved of my heart and mentioned in my soul! Were all the world and its peoples to become one ear, they would not fully attain unto the hearing of a single letter of the Word of God. Ye have heard and know this, while the people are in evident stupefaction. Since mention of trustworthiness and truthfulness hath appeared from the Tongue of Unity, therefore doth this servant make mention of two Tablets from the Tablets of God which were revealed concerning these stations, that ye may convey them unto the friends with wisdom and utterance, that perchance they may be disseminated and all may attain unto that which God hath willed.\n\nHe is the Sovereign in the Realms of Utterance\n\nWe were contemplating the earth and heard its tale and its tidings when lo, there emerged from one of the chambers of Paradise a radiant Maid who walked until she stood in mid-air and cried out with the most beauteous of voices: \"O concourse of earth and heaven! I am a Maid who hath been named 'Trust' in the preserved and inscribed Tablet. I have unveiled my face by the leave of my Lord that ye might behold my beauty and my majesty, my grace, my creation and nature, and that ye might witness mine eye darkened with kohl, my crimson cheek, my brilliant countenance, and my raven tresses. I adjure you, O concourse of creation, by the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of both this world and the next, that ye veil me not with the veils of treachery, greed and passion, nor abandon me before them. By the life of God! Treachery is among mine enemies, and its nature is rancor and hatred. I beseech you by the One, the Single, that ye let not mine arch-enemy gain mastery over me. Have mercy upon me, O people of the earth, and be not of the wrongdoers.\" Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and acquainted thee through allusion with what hath befallen Us in the Most Great Prison, that thou mayest be of those who are informed. We praise God for what hath come upon Us of tribulation in His straight Path. When thou readest the Tablet and knowest what is therein, remind My loved ones on My behalf and proclaim unto their faces greetings from the Wronged One, the Stranger.\n\nIn My Name, the Wondrous \\[...\\]\n\nHere is the Book of Truthfulness, sent down in truth from the presence of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily, it is the Messenger of Truth to all lands, that it may remind the people of its exalted station and acquaint them with its supreme position, its most glorious abode, show them its most wondrous beauty, its most elevated station and its most impregnable and glorious sovereignty. By the life of God! It walketh, and on its right walketh acceptance, on its left assurance, before it the standards of glory, and behind it the hosts of dignity. To this beareth witness He Who causeth the rivers to flow, verily He is the Knower of all things. It calleth out saying: \"O concourse of humanity! I have come to you from the presence of the Most Great Truth to make known to you its loftiness, its transcendence, its beauty, its perfection, its station, its glory and its splendor, that ye may find a way to its straight path.\" By God! He who is adorned with this supreme ornament is indeed of the people of this luminous station. Beware, O people, lest ye abandon it to the claws of falsehood. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Its likeness is as the sun - when it shineth forth from its horizon it illumineth the regions and brighteneth the faces of those who have attained. Whoso is deprived of it is indeed in manifest loss. We say: \"O Messenger! Canst thou enter the cities and regions, and canst thou find therein any helper?\" It saith: \"I have no knowledge save that which Thou hast taught me, verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" We have sent down this Tablet as a grace from Our presence that thou mayest remind the people of that which is therein from the presence of a mighty Commander. The glory be upon thee and upon him who reciteth the verses of the All-Merciful with joy and fragrance and is of them that are steadfast.\n\nIn this year most of the verses have flowed from the Supreme Pen - that is, the Truth, exalted be His glory, Himself wrote them. The mention of detachment, trustworthiness, faithfulness, truthfulness and other sublime attributes is evident and manifest in most of the Tablets. And since certain unpleasing matters occurred in this land, therefore the Supreme Pen, with regard to the education of the servants, has repeatedly revealed mention of those deeds, qualities and attributes that are the cause of the exaltation of sanctified souls, the upliftment of God's Cause, the assurance of the people of the world, and the preservation of all. Your honor and this servant must supplicate and beseech with utmost humility and devotion the Truth, exalted be His sovereignty, that He may aid His servants to achieve that which pleaseth Him and adorn them with that which is befitting and worthy. Verily He is the Powerful, the Exalted, the Answerer, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nAnother submission is that for those souls mentioned in your honored letter, after presentation before the Most Holy Presence, verses were revealed from the heaven of bounty specifically for each one. God willing, may all attain unto them and recite them with both outer and inner tongue. This is what was revealed for the sister of your honor's wife \\[...\\]\n\nO Jamal! Rejoice in that the All-Glorious, the Most High, makes mention of thee on this Day wherein Justice waileth like unto one bereft, by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. By God! The Temple of Justice lieth prostrate in the dust, while the Temple of Tyranny hath been raised upon the exalted throne through manifest pride. Yet, by thy life, the throne mocketh him, and the air foretelleth his torment, and the very ground seeketh refuge from him. By God, thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful! Behold and make mention of the one whom the people have made their leader instead of God, who is designated as \"the Speckled One\" in the Book of God, the Most High, the Most Great. He hath committed that which hath caused the Apostle to lament and the Chaste One to cry out, yet the people are in grievous schism. Verily thy Lord hath seized her through His authority and made her a warning to those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. O Jamal! Grieve not over anything, for verily He hath seized in this Revelation every oppressor who hath oppressed, and He will seize those whom thou seest today seated upon the thrones of religious authority without any evidence from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. They laugh in their houses while those whom they have wronged wail in Paradise and the Concourse on High. To this beareth witness the Lord of Names in this station which hath been named by all names in the Book of Names by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Pen! Cease the mention of the Speckled One, and make mention of her who turned unto God, and heard, and believed, and attained until she soared unto the Most Exalted Companion and the Supreme Paradise - the station wherein the Tongue of Eternity proclaimeth: \"The Kingdom is Mine Own Ancient Beauty!\" O Jamal! By My life, the Leaf hath soared unto the Divine Lote-Tree and beareth witness even as she bore witness in the transient days. Verily thy Lord is the Observer, the Witness. O Leaf! We make mention of thee as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. I bear witness that thou didst believe in God and turn unto Him on the day when the Most Great Branch appeared through that which the hands of the heedless had wrought. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the Word of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Rejoice in the Supreme Paradise, for God hath borne witness unto thee while seated upon His mighty throne. And We make mention in this station of him who was named ?amad, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Merciful. O ?amad! Be thou assured by the grace and mercy of God. Verily He maketh mention of thee in truth and will continue to mention thee as a bounty from Him, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. Hold fast unto the Book of God and His Way, then praise Him for this bounty which is incomparable to aught else created on earth. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Trustworthy. We have made mention of thee and thy wife in this Tablet, and We make mention of their mother who believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. Grieve not over that which hath befallen you. By the life of God! The world and all that is therein shall perish, and there shall endure that which hath been ordained for you in My mighty and exalted Kingdom. Your names have been treasured in this Treasury which hath been named the Tablet by the tongue of God, and it shall verily endure as long as His names endure. To this beareth witness every discerning mystic.\n\nThis Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will specially for the handmaiden of God Khadijih, who in the Blessed Tablet hath been designated as \"the Leaf.\" God knoweth that she hath attained unto that which the heavens and earth cannot equal. In truth, in this wondrous and transcendent Tablet, you and the servant 'Abdu's-Samad and the Leaf and that holy consort have all been made the recipients of God's special favors - may the spirit of the world be a sacrifice for His grace. Mention hath also been made therein of the martyrdom of the two luminous lights, and likewise of Kazim - upon them be the glory of God. Although the events in the land of Sad caused hearts to be consumed and the servants to raise their voices in lamentation, yet the man of insight who pondereth deeply and gazeth with detachment from all else but God will observe that no matter could be more glorious than that which came to pass. For this servant hath been aware of all details concerning the twin luminous lights from the beginning until now. They attained the presence of the Most Holy Court in Iraq, where the utmost favor was shown unto them. At first this matter ran counter to the imaginings of some, yet the hand of God's power raised them up and adorned them with the raiment of glory, and showered upon them the blessings of His gracious favors, until they reached such a station as your honor hath seen and heard. After returning from the Most Holy Court to the land of Sad, they submitted two petitions, and with the utmost humility and supplication, they besought from the All-Possessing Lord this very thing that came to pass. Now observe: praise be to God, throughout their lives they were manifested with the utmost glory among the servants through God's grace, and such love for them was instilled in hearts that none but God could reckon it. At the end of their lives they attained the most great martyrdom which they themselves had sought, and afterward you have seen what was revealed concerning them from the Supreme Pen. By God's life! Through that which was revealed for them, all things lament, the rocks cry out, and the denizens of Paradise weep. Should a soul possess and sacrifice the whole world, he would not attain to this station - a station which all the Messengers and near ones have longed for and still long for. Thus far, nearly a hundred Tablets, nay more, have been revealed concerning this supreme calamity, for even now in some Tablets mention is made of the martyrs. Now what station could be more exalted than this station, what rank more great than this rank? On one occasion He said: \"O servant! Although such events as these have been and are the cause of countless sorrows, yet they are the cause of the exaltation of God's Cause. One should complain of matters that cause the Cause to be wasted.\" We beseech God - glorified and exalted be He - to guide all and assist them to that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. And He said: \"Write: O Beauty! The Cause of God was seen as more glorious than all things in the Prison Land, but now it hath reached a point where mention of it would cause fresh sorrows. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient, the All-Forbearing.\"\n\nRegarding your renewed mention of the land of Kha, this is what hath shone forth from the horizon of utterance \\[...\\]\n\nO Beauty! Give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My loving-kindness and My mercy that have preceded all created things. We make mention of them and will continue to mention them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We have accepted what they sent after their names appeared before the Throne. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the All-Wise. Those whose names thou didst mention in thy letter - We have made mention of them in such wise as to attract the hearts of the sincere ones, and We send from this station Our greetings upon their faces and give them the glad-tidings that they shall have a station of glory most noble. Bounty is in His hand - He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He willeth, and ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth that which shall bring delight to the eyes of them that behold.\n\nAs for what thou didst write concerning Mirza 'Ali-Rida, it was submitted. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in reply:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh the truth in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nGlorified be He Who hath sent down the blessing and made manifest the Word - and verily it is the Path which hath been set up in truth by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And verily it is the Most Great Balance, though the people understand not. And verily it is the Most Great Trumpet which hath been blown, whereat all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save them whom the hand of thy Lord's power, the Mighty, the Loving, did rescue. Blessed art thou for having turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon when mankind turned away therefrom. Thy Lord is verily the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Blessed be the one who, strong in faith, hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings, turning unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Thy name hath been mentioned in the Book of My namesake who believed in My Self and acknowledged that which I have acknowledged in My Kingdom, who attained unto My presence before My throne and circled round about Me and soared in My atmosphere and bore hardships in My path, and who was named \"The Beauty\" by God, the Lord of existence. We make mention of thee that he may rejoice and be of them who speak forth the praise of God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. We have made mention of all who have turned toward the Countenance, that My remembrance may be a treasure unto them in My Kingdom, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. Thus have We remembered thee and revealed for thee that which brings joy to the eyes.\n\nAnd likewise mention was made in the Most Holy Presence of His Honor Buzurg, upon him be 96\\[Baha\\], which was in that distinguished One's handwriting. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:\n\nHe is the Most Mighty, the Most Ancient, the Most Glorious\n\nSay: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of Names and in Whose grasp is the reins of all things! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, whereby the nations were shaken except for those whom the hand of Thy power did preserve, that Thou assist me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee in such wise that the cawing of the ignorant ones who have cast Thy commandments behind their backs, who dispute Thy signs, deny Thy Cause and turn away from Thy Beauty may not hinder me. O my Lord! Send down from the clouds of Thy mercy that which shall cause to grow the plants of Thy wisdom and the roses of Thy knowledge in the breasts of those who have attained unto the wine of Thy revelation and the water of Thy inspiration. O my Lord! Aid every one who turneth toward the triumph of Thy Cause and who standeth firm in his love for Thee. Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then write down for me, O my God, whatsoever beseemeth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy grace. Thou art verily the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge. Thou hearest and seest, and Thou art verily the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAnd likewise the other names, upon them be the Glory of God, which were in your book were submitted one by one. Wondrous and sublime verses were revealed specifically for each one. God willing, they shall attain unto them.\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious.\n\nO Nasr! The Wronged One witnesses thy turning and devotion to God, and hath revealed for thee that which shall solace thine eyes and gladden thy heart and the hearts of them that hear. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then make mention of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. He hath turned toward thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison and hath remembered thee with that which is more precious than the Water of Life in the sight of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Be thou thankful and say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the worlds! The glory rest upon thee and upon thy wife who hath believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Mu'min, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Lord of the Final End. We have remembered thee before as a bounty from Us, and We are the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto My Kingdom and drunk the choice wine of My favor from the hands of My bounty and hath spoken forth My wondrous remembrance. Indeed thy mention was inscribed in the Book of My Name, and We have sent down for thee these verses that outweigh the treasuries of the heavens and earth. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy wife who hath attained in the days of God, the Single, the All-Informed.\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named 'Ali, who hath turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, and We counsel him with that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of Creation, may be uplifted. O 'Ali! Hearken unto My call, then rejoice in the remembrance of thy Lord through Whom the horizons were illumined. Blessed is he who hath heard the call of the Wronged One and hath turned, detached from all directions, toward His path. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy son who hath believed in the Single One, the Chosen.\n\nWe make mention of 'Ali-'Askar who hath believed in God, the Lord of Destiny, on a day wherein every man of learning was shaken, every theologian turned away, and every philosopher objected, save whom God willed, the Lord of the worlds. How many a learned one have We made his knowledge as fire unto him, how many a scholar have We passed by and made him a lesson to them that observe, how many a rich one hath been deceived by riches until he turned away from the Lord of all mankind, and how many a poor one hath attained the Kawthar of eternity in the days of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named Shir-'Ali that every believer may be assured that We remember those who remember their Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Hearken unto My call that calleth thee from the precincts of My distant prison. Beseech God to make thee steadfast in His Cause and speaking forth His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Mirza that he may rejoice in the remembrance of his Lord and be of them that are steadfast. O servant! Trust thou in God in all matters, then remember My days and My tribulation and that which hath befallen My Self and My chosen ones who have believed in My verses and have turned unto My luminous horizon. Thus have We sent down the verses as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the Revealer, the All-Bountiful.\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of 'Akka, the place wherein this Wronged One, the Mighty, hath been imprisoned. The Call hath encompassed them that are in earth and heaven, yet most of the people are heedless. Blessed art thou for having cast away idle fancies and turned unto the Lord of all beings Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. Joy be unto thee for having taken the choice wine of recognition and drunk in the name of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. How many a servant turned away in the days of God from the Dawning-Place of Revelation, and how many a servant came forward and received that which was bestowed from God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus doth the morn of utterance breathe forth when the temple of the All-Merciful was established upon His mighty throne. The glory rest upon him who mentioned thee in his Book, and upon thee and upon thy wife whom God hath associated with His Name. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO My Name \"Beauty\"! Verily, We make mention of all My loved ones together, and from the precincts of My prison I pronounce My glorification upon their faces, and I bless them and remember them at every morn and eve. O Beauty! Give them the glad-tidings of the ocean of My loving-kindness, the heaven of My grace, and the sun of My mercy which hath encompassed the worlds. Say: By God! The Supreme Pen moveth in remembrance of you, and the Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned towards your faces from this glorious and exalted Station. Rejoice ye in My remembrance, then drink in My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We bid you to be joyful and We make mention of My party on this day wherein Mine ear hath heard what hath befallen My sister at the hands of the oppressors. We testify that she turned unto God and attained and soared in Mine atmosphere and heard My call and moved by My leave and My will. Thus doth the Supreme Pen bear witness, but most of the people are in evident doubt. Blessed is he who visiteth her and turneth unto her purely for the sake of his Lord, the Beneficent, the Giver, the Generous.\n\nO Beauty! The Point of the Bayan hath said that all were created to be mentioned in that Most Holy, Most Luminous, Most Exalted Presence. Now observe and know the value of this bounty, that the Supreme Pen, at a time when all sorrows have encompassed it, is occupied with the mention of His loved ones. By My life! Neither the hosts of the contingent world nor its events have prevented Me. I have spoken at all times and summoned all unto the All-Informed One. Convey greetings from the Wronged One of the horizons to all the friends. Several calamities have occurred, and lastly the news about the sister was outwardly presented to the Most Holy Court. In truth she was wronged, and there befell her secretly that which none save God can enumerate. Blessed is she, and My glory be upon her for her patience in God and for bearing hardships in His straight Path.\n\nFurthermore, numerous Tablets have been sent from the heaven of divine bounty especially for you, including a Tablet specifically for you and other Tablets through Aqa Siyyid 'Ali-Akbar. Likewise, through Ibn-i-A?daq - may the Glory of God rest upon them both - a Tablet was revealed and sent specifically for you, and now too a most mighty and impregnable Tablet has been sent by post. With such divine favors and lordly bounties, you must at all times be engaged with utmost joy and fragrance in the mention of the Beloved of the worlds, in such wise that those unconscious from the wine of heedlessness may become conscious, the withered ones in the valley of idle fancies may become fresh, and the dead in the graves of rejection may become alive and enduring. The Glory be upon you, and Peace be upon you, and the Mercy be upon you, and the Loving-kindness of God be upon you.\n\n=== END BH00041 ===\n\n=== START BH00042 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most High Lord!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath sent down that which was hidden in the heaven of His Will, revealed that which was treasured in His knowledge, and sent Him Who was heralded in His Books, by His Messengers, His Chosen Ones and His Prophets - through Whom the ocean of knowledge surged in the world of being and the gates of Paradise were opened unto the people of faith. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath manifested Himself to guide creation to the straight path. Praise be to God Who hath established His Cause in such wise that neither tribulations can defeat it nor calamities weaken it. He hath, with the hands of power, planted the Tree of His Cause and watered it with the blood of the chosen ones and the righteous. Neither the clamor of the servants nor the hatred of those in the lands can frustrate Him. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou by Whose Face's light the horizons were illumined and in separation from Whom the lovers lamented! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the hearts of the sincere ones and the minds of the mystics were attracted, to assist the people of Thy realm to champion Thy Cause and enable them, O my God, to achieve what Thou hast willed through Thy decree. O Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones in prison. The oppressors have seized them, bound them, and imprisoned them because they believed in Thee and Thy verses and turned to Thy most exalted horizon in Thy days. They are those who, O my God, aided Thy Cause and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy grace, and broke not Thy Covenant and Testament. The utterance of Him Who conversed on Sinai so moved them that they spoke forth before all faces in days wherein the clouds of oppression had obscured the horizon of justice. O Lord! Thou hearest their sighing from the land of ?a and the cry of the oppressed ones in other lands. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, to protect Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies. Then assist them through the manifestations of Thy power and might, and the dawning-places of Thy strength and will. Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, nor can the tyranny of the divines or the oppression of princes prevent Thee. Gladden, O my God, the eyes of Thy chosen ones through the wonders of Thy grace. Thou art, verily, the Lord of the world and the Guardian of the nations.\n\nI moreover beseech Thee, O my God, to enable me to make mention of those whom Thou hast related unto Thyself and made to be of the branches of the Tree of Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures, and of him whom Thou hast mentioned with Thy tongue on land and sea, in the valleys and mountains. O Lord! He is among those who have attained unto Thy grace and whom Thou hast given to drink the water of life of Thy love through the hands of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to send down upon him that which will gladden his heart and solace his eyes in such wise that the sorrows of the world and whatsoever is with the nations touch him not. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. My spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness!\n\nGlory be unto Him in Whose hand lieth dominion over all things! Such is the humiliation of this evanescent one that both pen and ink fail to recount it, and the tongue falleth silent--a humiliation which, were it to emerge from the realm of the hidden into the world of manifestation, would cause the very eye of loving-kindness to weep, and would move to tumult the hearts and souls of all sincere ones. Yet God, exalted be His glory, beareth witness and is My testimony that at all times thy remembrance hath been present in My heart and manifest before My face in the Most Great Scene, while the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken words from which the fragrance of loving-kindness and bounty hath been wafted. Well is it with thee, and blessed art thou! The cause and reason for the delay is clear and evident. Let not thy honor imagine that there hath truly been any negligence, though in one respect the shortcomings of this evanescent one are established. Rather, the causes that have led to the postponement in responding to thy letters have been services to the Cause, and the King of the Cause hath reckoned thee among the branches of the Blessed Tree. Therefore, in one respect, this service returneth unto thee. Thus is it proven that I have stood in service to thy honor. In this case, thy honor will accept this valid excuse. Letters have been arriving continuously from all directions, and likewise petitions which this evanescent servant must write in His presence, and afterward make copies of the blessed Tablets and present responses to various quarters. The rest is clear and evident. In truth, were it not for divine bounty, this service could never be accomplished by this evanescent one. Praise be unto Him for having aided His servant in that which He commanded. So long as life remaineth in this body, I shall remain steadfast in service. Not for a moment have I been, nor shall I be, absent from thy vision. Though the mention, praise and service of this servant are not worthy of mention, the main purpose is that through His grace they are remembered in the Most Holy Court and are adorned through their connection to Him. This is the essence--naught else hath any mention or existence. Thy letter dated the seventh of Jamadiyu'th-Thani refreshed the realm of the heart with the breezes of love. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve this blessing, for verily He hath power over all things. After perusal, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Station and presented it in the Most Holy and Most Glorious Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance--glorified be His Name and exalted be His grandeur: In My Name, the All-Evident, the All-Informed, the All-Wise \\[...\\]\n\nO Afnan! Upon thee be my Baha! The children of this age have risen against the All-Glorious and All-Sufficient Lord and, with utmost wretchedness, have endeavored to extinguish the light and quench the fire of the Blessed Tree. \"It behooveth them to play with clay.\" Reflect upon the lack of awareness among the ignorant ones of the earth who are known for their learning. The equivalent of all divine books now existing among different peoples hath been revealed, and they have known and do know that the Revealer is sanctified above all outward knowledge; yet still they have arisen in denial. By God's life! They are greater in their denial than the deniers of the past. The Word itself beareth testimony to the loftiness and transcendence of Truth, but it increaseth not the wrongdoers save in loss.\n\nBehold, then remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"And the trumpet shall be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth shall swoon, except whom God pleaseth; then it shall be blown again, and lo! they shall stand up looking on.\" Today all are seen to have swooned from the Divine Word, save whom God pleaseth, for mighty is the Cause, and not every soul is worthy of understanding It, drawing nigh unto It, and standing firm in It. Today the Speaker of Sinai uttereth this word: \"He\" hath appeared in the garment of \"I\", and the Hidden One speaketh with \"I am the Manifest One.\" Difficult it is for the infants of the world to attain unto this station. This blessed Word is the water of life for the people of steadfastness and truth, and a deadly poison for the heedless souls who have turned away.\n\nThe clouds of oppression have seized the horizon of justice, and the mists of tyranny have prevented the lights of equity from shining forth. Yet ere long shall the heedless souls who have turned away behold themselves in grievous loss. The tyranny of oppressors and the transgressions of the heedless have ever been and shall continue to be the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. That which causeth the lamentation of those near unto God are the deeds of souls who claim adherence to the Truth yet perpetrate that which hath been explicitly forbidden in all divine Books.\n\nIn the beginning, the government in the land of Ta (Tehran) acted with moderation, but such fear seized certain of those who had entered that they spoke words in utmost secrecy which caused the government to become convinced that they intended rebellion, although the speaker himself testifieth to the falsity of this statement. Would that the spies and investigators had been limited to those two who had departed, for they reported all that they saw and heard. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. My Name, the Concealer, hath concealed, and He is the Concealer, the All-Knowing. Repeatedly hath the Most Exalted Pen commanded all to wisdom and counseled that which would cause the elevation of the Cause. Beseech ye God that He may aid all to act, for if those who have turned to God would conduct themselves according to His will, they would find themselves victorious and triumphant. To this doth testify this Book that speaketh in this Most Great Prison. The glory be upon thee and upon the Friend and upon the Afnans who are there.\n\nPraised be God! That which hath been revealed is such that were all the mirrors of existence to be placed before it, the blessed words \"The Truth hath appeared\" would be reflected in them all. The world is intoxicated with the wine of pride, and all are occupied with their own concerns. The tongue of exhortation and counsel speaketh unceasingly without pause or delay, yet none is aware. Wonder upon wonder! To such an extent have the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings seized the people that they neither heed nor will heed any sign, proof or evidence.\n\nThey wrote from the land of Ta that His honor 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power, had recited the revealed Surahs before the Prince-Regent in several gatherings, including the blessed Surah of Ra'is and Paris which were replete with mention of events to come. Thereafter the Regent said: \"How do we know these Surahs were not revealed after the events?\" Indeed, even if God should bring every sign, they would not believe nor acknowledge. Ever have miracles been lost upon the heedless, and in every age and century when they appeared, they bore no fruit but rather increased animosity.\n\nConsider now that in those same days when Siyyid Sadiq, who was the instigator, was seized by God, yet they remained heedless and arose to perpetrate tyranny greater than before, until another person who spoke with utmost pride and rebellion and devised plans to extinguish the light was suddenly seized, yet no benefit resulted. The aforementioned Siyyid asked for respite, saying he would emerge after three days to personally undertake the martyrdom of the faithful souls. After three days his vile corpse was brought out, yet still no effect was manifest. Yes, they wrote that on the day the second one was seized, some awakening was evident, but after a day or two they returned to their former state. However, this much I say: all are giving their lives; soon will the lights of the Cause encompass the world. Consider how they who had no purpose save the reformation of the world, the unity of nations and the comfort of all have been subjected to such tyranny. Fie upon those who cling to falsehood, turn away from truth, and grasp the transient while heedless of the everlasting.\n\nRegarding the mention of the dream that was made, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. He said: \"This dream is evidence of divine exaltation, sublimity and favor, both outward and inward, concerning them. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\" And concerning what they observed of bread and meat being present - these two are among God's greatest bounties, as the Messenger of God, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, said aforetime: \"Upon you be the two red ones,\" meaning bread and meat. And in one instance it refers to \"blessing\" where He says \"And they ask thee concerning the blessing.\" And that a portion of the meat was cleansed and bestowed upon them - this indicates their sincerity, by God's truth, and likewise manifests the bounty and generosity of God, glorified be His majesty. And in one station it is the true heavenly table sent down, which in its primary rank has been and is divine love. Whatever is said in this regard is pure truth. This dream indicates grace, mercy, favor, kindness and bounty, both outward and inward, from God. He should rejoice and thank God, his Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. And in the end of what We showed him and caused him to hear are signs for those who are discerning. The End.\n\nHis vision accords with outward reality and requires no interpretation or commentary. That which befits it hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. He is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing.\n\nAs for the mention of wisdom and the statement that \"we have not yet understood what is meant by wisdom,\" this evanescent servant submits what was manifested in Iraq and elsewhere, that perchance the matter may become clear. Although there were and are explanations about wisdom from before and after, the time does not permit their mention. However, I shall submit what I witnessed myself:\n\nWhen the Sun was shining from the horizon of Zawra, all people - whether scholars, mystics, or others - in Baghdad and its surroundings, even unto Basra, showed utmost love, humility and submissiveness. One day, Siyyid Davud, who was the Mufti of Basra, came to attain the presence along with a group, including the renowned Ibn-i-Alusi. They sat outside awaiting permission to enter. The aforementioned Siyyid mentioned to that group that His fame in those regions was tremendous, saying \"I believe He Himself is unaware of it.\" The Cause had reached such a station that whenever He would leave His house in any direction, the Arabs would utter words they would not say even about their own saints.\n\nFor instance, one Friday as He was walking alone to the mosque near His house, someone about two hundred paces away, also heading to the mosque, said to his companion: \"By God, the Cause of this Man is wondrous and mighty,\" pointing to the Ancient Beauty. That day, as it happened, He sat opposite the pulpit. After prayers, the preacher, who was one of Iraq's divines, told one of the believers: \"His Holiness came today and sat opposite the pulpit. I could not deliver the sermon and felt great embarrassment.\" That divine is now secretly a believer.\n\nDuring the days of departure and migration from Iraq, all witnessed what they had never seen before. By the Truth itself, those Arabs wept like spring clouds and lamented. On the day of transfer to the Ridvan Garden, throngs of townspeople, both learned and common, came saying: \"Because we were assured of Your constant presence here, we were deprived of attaining Your presence. Now suddenly You are departing!\"\n\nOn the day of departure from Ridvan, when they brought the horse, such weeping, lamenting and crying arose that the horse became restless, as if walking upon people, until He came and mounted. After He mounted, people fell upon the horse's hands and feet. Were I to give the details, a whole book would be required. Most have heard these matters, and some were present and witnessed them. For during the stay in Iraq, He associated with scholars, mystics, common people and those of various religions. He answered whatever was asked. Later, in Mu?arram, the believers of that land celebrated the first of the month as a festival, it being the birth day of the Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, and rode boats upon the Tigris with songs \\[...\\]\n\nAnd they rode upon boats on the Tigris, engaged in music and singing, which caused both Sunnis and Shi'is to arise in opposition. You have surely heard what transpired in that land. Moreover, the heedless people knew not what was the purpose of this festival and what it signified. As soon as they saw it outwardly different, they committed that which all have heard. That is to say, this imprudence of the friends caused great harm. Before that and after the migration, the governor, officials, and likewise the people of the city, both clergy and others, showed the utmost consideration to the loved ones of God. Even Namiq Pasha, who was the governor, showed the utmost kindness to each one, and he had informed the companions about the arrival in Istanbul and Adrianople. Consider what happened in the Land of Ta. His Holiness Ismu'llah, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, set out for those parts with permission and authorization, and was instructed to acquire land there and deposit the Trust of God in that land. From the presence of the Truth, this was the main purpose of this great and momentous matter. After arrival, the friends associated and held feasts. His Holiness Ismu'llah himself wrote a letter to this servant, wherein he mentioned: \"This servant is perplexed, for after arrival the friends of God have associated and continue to associate, and thus far they have held thirty-eight feasts, and at each gathering it has been observed that sixty or fifty persons are present.\" I said: \"Have you not heard the decree of wisdom which states that gatherings should not exceed five to nine persons?\" They said: \"Yes, we have heard,\" and likewise they mentioned the instructions they had in mind and acknowledged them. Nevertheless, the next evening an even larger gathering was observed. And he wrote that \"I am perplexed - if I do not go, there is fear they might think it is from fear, and this was not and is not befitting the Cause of God; and if I go, I see it is contrary to wisdom. In any case, I remain bewildered and perplexed. Nevertheless, most of the friends are mentioned, as I have not found opportunity to meet them all.\" Now if they had acted according to the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen and the wisdom revealed in the Book, this sedition would not have outwardly ignited and arisen. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of utterance, had they acted according to that which God had revealed, now the lights of justice would have encompassed most. First, in these matters He had said that gatherings should not exceed five to nine persons, and even these should not be successive and continuous. And likewise He had said: \"Believe not every speaker and trust not every newcomer.\" And likewise at first when meeting any soul they should regard him as a child and not give him heavy and thick foods. They should deal gently until the veils are rent asunder with the passing of hours and days and the lights of the Sun of knowledge illuminate existence. In the Tablet of Wisdom this most exalted Word was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. His word, exalted be His majesty: \"Say: The essence of utterance seeketh penetration and moderation. As for penetration, it dependeth upon refinement, and refinement is conditioned upon hearts which are detached and pure.\"\n\nRefinement is dependent upon pure and detached hearts, while moderation is linked with the wisdom We have sent down in the scriptures and tablets. In all degrees, that which has been revealed, if acted upon, has been and continues to be the cause of exaltation, ascendancy, the drawing near of people and their orientation toward the horizon of the Cause. Wisdom is that which does not prevent people from drawing near and does not cast man into the abyss of perdition. Yea, the Cause belongs to God, exalted be His glory, and destiny and fate are ruled and commanded.\n\nOne of the friends of God visited a place to teach the Cause. The people of that town knew of his connection to this Most Great Announcement and this mighty Cause, and they associated with him that they might understand something. However, they secretly investigated to discover his deeds. As it happened, it was during the blessed month of Ramadan, and they were watching from a place until they saw him break the fast. Thereafter, they would not come near to ask anything or hear any response. This is the time for deeds, not words, for the deed made the distinction.\n\nLikewise, concerning the conditions of teachers, utterances have been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful's will such that any fair-minded person who hearkens would soar on wings of longing in the atmosphere of divine love. Yet praise be to God, despite the lack of means and of what is befitting, and despite the turning away and objection of those on earth, that which became the cause of gathering, dispersion and resurrection appeared in every land. This transient world, its ephemeral means and its temporal conditions have occupied all and prevented them from serving the Cause, save whom God wills. In truth, the Truth alone stands and is engaged in the victory of the Cause.\n\nHis honor expressed amazement at the wisdom, but this servant is immersed in the ocean of wonderment, for it is observed that never has such sweetness been raised up, and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is manifest at every moment, and the melodies of the Supreme Pen have in truth encompassed the realms of dominion and kingdom. Nevertheless, the people are observed to be asleep, nay, thunderstruck, nay, dead. The first trumpet is established and all are thunderstruck, but if God should will it, from this latter trumpet \"behold, they stand up and look around.\" The Euphrates flows and streams, but thirst is nowhere to be found. This evanescent one beseeches and hopes from the peerless Lord that He may awaken the people and not deprive them of this most great bounty. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nIn brief, the meaning of wisdom is that complete severance should not occur, for if severance reaches its ultimate degree, none would seek to draw near to hear the Word of God. His Holiness the Spirit (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him), although He abrogated certain laws of the Torah such as divorce and the Sabbath, nevertheless continued to observe some Torah ordinances. Thus in His final days when His ascension drew near, He commanded Peter and John saying \"Go and prepare the Passover,\" and afterward He observed the Passover, even though it was specific to the Jews. The way of the Prophets is different from that of the servants. Out of grace and favor They showed forbearance lest people be suddenly destroyed. At times They would impart the melodies of the Dove of Paradise, and at times the cry of the Peacock of the Throne. Sometimes They would speak from the realm of limitations and other times beyond it. This was due to Their grace, kindness and favor, for if the Torah had been openly and manifestly abrogated at first, what occurred at the end would have happened at the beginning before the seed was sown. The Command is in God's hand. He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO beloved of My heart! By God, the Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. Although today those souls who have turned to God and are steadfast and firm are striving with utmost effort to carry out God's commandments, nevertheless one must seek confirmation and assistance from the Self-Sufficient One for their steadfastness, let alone for other people. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to raise up men who will arise to serve the Cause with perfect power, might and steadfastness.\n\nAnother matter: The petition from the honored lady, the Mother (upon her be My Most Glorious Glory), was received. Previously an exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for her. And when My beloved, Aqa Mirza 'Ali and his honored mother (upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God) were departing for the land of Sh, He graciously bestowed with His own blessed hand a ring engraved with the Greatest Name and a woolen veil especially for the Mother. Likewise, through Shaykh Salman (upon him be the Glory of God), multiple Tablets were revealed and sent especially for the honored sons. And again on this day, which is the third day of the month of Muharram, the petition of the son Aqa Mirza (upon him be the Glory of God and His favor) was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court, and an exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of merciful grace. God willing they will attain to it and be gladdened through God's favor, exalted be His glory. This is what was revealed from the Kingdom of might and power. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the Expositor, the All-Wise\\[...\\]\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Merciful!\n\nThe Tongue of Mercy proclaims: O My friend and offspring of My Afnan! The robe of glory hath been fashioned and made ready to the measure of your temples, for that which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen cannot be equaled by any thing among all things. Praise be to God! From early youth thou art associated with the Truth and art mentioned by His Name. The abasement of these days is the dawning-place of glory and the dayspring of favor. Soon will God manifest, in truth, a matter from His presence, the Lord of all worlds. Were the people to know, they would circle round about you. Soon will they know what hath escaped them on the day when mankind stood before the Lord of the worlds. Fleeting earthly conditions have prevented people from hearing and seeing; neither are their ears worthy to hear nor their eyes capable of beholding. By God's life! They are in manifest loss. The Perspicuous Book speaketh and the Mother Book is manifest, yet all are deprived and forbidden save whom God willeth. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee and unto thy brothers and unto those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon them and upon My Afnan who have quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hands of My bounty. They are, verily, among the triumphant in a mighty Book.\n\nIn every age and century, people have, through their vain imaginings, visited upon the friends of God that which is recorded in the books and mentioned by tongues. Yet whatsoever they have done, God hath made it a cause for the exaltation of His Most Exalted Word, despite themselves. He, verily, is the Strong, the Powerful. This Most Great Revelation and that which hath been ordained by the Pen of God through His prevailing Will need no mention or explanation. Soon will the sincere ones behold that which was hidden from them today, and the standards of the signs will be unfurled throughout all regions and districts, and every soul will testify that the Cause is God's, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nConcerning what was written about the spiritual beloved, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, his petition was presented upon arrival, and at that very moment a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for him from the heaven of divine Will, though its dispatch was delayed. Likewise, another exalted Tablet - according to what was written, they have in these days directed their attention to those parts. God willing, may they be confirmed in service to the Cause. They have also sent correspondences to this servant from every direction, all of which have arrived, but this evanescent servant was not successful in responding, thinking that whenever the revealed Tablets would be sent, this servant would also send replies according to his capacity and station. Now suddenly the command has issued from the Dayspring of the Cause to send the Tablets and this letter, thus this servant found no opportunity. However, I submit this much: God willing, whatever has been missed shall be attended to. I beseech God for assistance and confirmation in all conditions. If they have arrived in that land, greetings and salutations from this evanescent servant are entrusted to your grace.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about Jinab-i-Lutf'ali Khan, his petition was presented and attained the honor of being heard. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for him and sent. His word, exalted be His majesty and greatness:\n\nIn the name of the One Incomparable, All-Powerful God.\n\nThe whole world was created for this blessed Day, and all scriptures, books, psalms and tablets gave the servants glad tidings of this Revelation. Whatever has been created in the world of bounties and favors was, without doubt, created for the sake of Truth and brought from nothingness into being. Nevertheless, they have consigned Him to the most desolate of lands. Though at first the seat of the Wronged One was in the most exalted place, yet He dwelt in a house from whose ceiling earth continuously fell, and likewise its floor was covered with dust. The heedless had severely restricted Him from all directions, to such extent that sorrow encompassed those in the Kingdom. Nevertheless, We were patient. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient, the Concealer, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nTherefore you should not be saddened by the world's conflicts and its unpleasing conditions. By the life of God, had any worth been perceived in it, surely the Prophets, the chosen ones, and the saints of God would not have given themselves up to the oppressors. Commit all affairs to God and trust in Him, and ask Him to manifest whatever is best for you. Say: Glory be to Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the ocean of knowledge surged in creation and by Whose love the fire was kindled in hearts! I beseech Thee by the splendor of Thy Identity, the eternity of Thy Being, the ocean of Thy Will, and the sun of Thy Purpose, and by the cry of the sincere ones in Thy days and the lamentation of those near unto Thee in the prison of Thine enemies, to make me content with what Thy Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for me in the kingdom of creation. Then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy mercy that which will profit me, through Thy bounty and generosity. O my Lord! I have committed my affairs unto Thee and placed my trust in Thee. I beseech Thee to make firm my steps and grant me that which will draw me near unto Thee in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the manifestations of Thy grandeur to aid me in Thy remembrance, Thy praise and the service of Thy Cause. Thou art He Who knoweth what is within me while I know not what is with Thee. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nHis bounty is such that whoever makes a supplication in whatever tongue will receive an answer, especially if the Afnan be the intermediary. God willing, the Khan will be blessed with a divine tablet and be confirmed in that which is the cause and reason for the manifestations of the bounties of God, exalted be His glory. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, heareth and answereth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Aqa Shukru'llah, upon him be the glory of God, and what the beloved Aqa Shaykh-'Ali Mirza, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, sent from the land of Sh, and what you dispatched from that land - they and the aforementioned branches arrived in Port Said, but then the diverse winds of the world and newly arising matters prevented them from attaining the presence until now, the third of Muharram al-Haram, they remain in the aforementioned land. However, their news and letters have arrived and continue to arrive. God willing, they shall attain their goal and receive what God has willed. In truth, this small piece has caused trouble. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant abundant reward. Verily He is the Generous Giver.\n\nThe second letter from Your Honor, dated the third of the month of Rajab, bestowed the joy of union and illumined the realm of love and unity. Praise be to God that Your Honor is blessed with good health and divine love. What can I say? God the One is witness that whenever a message has arrived from the Afnan of the Sacred Tree, it has been like water to the tree of humanity. It is abundantly clear what pure water does. After reading and perusing it, I turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and this supreme word flowed from the tongue of the Lord of Creation, exalted be His grandeur: \"O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory. The Book speaks, and that which is intended and written is manifest, yet souls remain heedless. God, exalted be His glory, has desired for His servants supreme joy, greatest comfort, and magnificent bounty, yet the servants have sought endless degradation and even aimed to shed holy blood, both before and after. Woe unto them for this grievous error.\" Your Honor and the loved ones of God should beseech that perhaps the doors of knowledge might be opened by the finger of power upon the faces of the heedless, that they may not remain deprived of the peerless station.\n\nRegarding the mention made of the honored gentleman the teacher and the esteemed Afnan of the Blessed Tree, this lowly one presents his utter nothingness to each one and seeks their benevolent prayers. In Your Honor's envelope there was a letter from Mulla Muhammad Shafi' (upon him be the Glory of God), which he had written to this lowly one, and the contents of that petition were presented to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. It was presented, and wondrous and sublime verses were revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful's utterance and sent forth. God willing, they will attain unto them. Thus has spoken He, exalted be His glory and supreme be His grandeur. He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Shafi'! The fragrances of the Kingdom have encompassed the realms, and the dove hath warbled upon the branch of divine might. The Book hath come, to which all the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have testified. The servant who is present hath come before the Countenance and laid before the Wronged One that which the tongue of thy heart uttered on a day whereon the faces of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of existence, were darkened. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Hidden Tablet, which was concealed in God's knowledge and inscribed in His Preserved Tablet. Glorify My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My remembrance of them from this praiseworthy station. We counsel them with that whereby God's Cause will be exalted amongst His servants. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what he hath been commanded in God's Book, the Lord of what was and what shall be.\n\nO My loved ones in that land! We counsel you to observe justice and fairness, trustworthiness and religiousness, chastity and fidelity. Your Lord, the Most Merciful, is verily the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Loving. He hath created you, sustained you, aided you in His Cause, and made known unto you that which was hidden from most of the learned ones. He counseleth you with that which shall profit you in each world of His worlds. To this testifieth My Most Exalted Pen, and beyond it, He Who speaketh in every condition that there is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nO Shafi'! Rejoice in that We made mention of thee before, whence the fragrance of My loving-kindness was wafted, and in this irrevocable Tablet. We make mention of 'Abdu'l-Husayn who was mentioned in thy letter and give him the glad tidings of Our remembrance of him, that he may rejoice in the days of his Lord, the Lord of the seen and unseen. And thy other son, who was named Muhammad-Husayn, We beseech God to aid them both to turn towards His most exalted horizon and to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of men have slipped save those whom God hath willed, the Lord of the elevated Throne. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon thy wife and her mother, from God, the Powerful, the Kind, the Forgiving.\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Jalal, who attained in the days of God and heard His sweetest call when most of the servants turned away. O Jalal! Dost thou know Who calleth thee and maketh mention of thee? Dost thou know Who is established upon the throne? Doth anyone hear His lamentation in His Most Great Prison? Hast thou recognized Him Who hath appeared at the final return? Say: By God! Through His appearance the kingdom of names was shaken, through His sovereignty the pillars of the learned were made to tremble. He hath spoken that whereby all things were attracted and the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings were thunderstruck.\n\nWe make mention from this station of him who was named Muhammad-Rahim and counsel him with that which shall be as a lamp unto him in the darkness of the earth and in every world of the worlds of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Muhammad-Rahim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee and commandeth thee with that which He commanded in His presence and with that which We commanded all in the Book. Say: O loved ones of God! Be not grieved by what hath befallen My name and My loved ones through that which the hands of every heedless doubter have wrought. God shall soon seize him who hath oppressed even as He seized the oppressors of old. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Compelling. Nothing can frustrate Him and no affair can thwart Him. He doeth as He willeth and with Him is the Mother of the Book.\n\nWe make mention of Ahmad-'Ali on this day wherein the cry hath been raised in truth and the raven hath croaked. Be thou vocal in the remembrance of thy Lord, turn thy face toward the light of His countenance, and be steadfast in serving His loved ones at eventide and at dawn. We found thy turning unto Us, We turned unto thee from this most exalted station and made mention of thee with this remembrance before which all remembrances bow down. We glorify from this station the faces of My loved ones and handmaidens in that land and give them the glad tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in earth and heaven.\n\nPraise be to the Goal of all the worlds, Who through His grace bestowed favor upon all and deprived none save those who deprived themselves. The world hath deluded them and kept them back from the Lord of all beings in the hereafter.\n\nAs to what was written concerning Aqa Mirza Ahmad - today is the day of pure servitude, all must hold fast unto it. Blessed is the soul who truly attaineth thereunto. It behooveth us, and him, and those who have believed in God to hold fast unto this most exalted station and to think on ways to promote the Cause. Verily the servant beseecheth his Lord to protect him and His loved ones lest there appear from them that which beseemeth not His days, His Revelation, His glory and His sovereignty. These passages should be sent by your honor along with the Tablet, and conveying greetings and praise to them is left to your honor's discretion.\n\nConcerning what was written about the attention of the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and Khan, upon him be \\[the Glory of God\\] - this was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak forth in the Kingdom of Utterance, glorified be His majesty:\n\nWe beseech God to aid them to serve the Cause and teach that which the All-Bestowing hath revealed in the Book, in such wise that neither what is witnessed nor what is seen may become a veil or hindrance. God willing, may they be adorned with the robe of piety, the mantle of detachment, and the crown of severance. All that was mentioned is as a weapon for teachers, nay rather more piercing, more decisive and more penetrating.\n\nEstablish in that land a consultative assembly, for this is blessed. The purpose of this is that they may hold fast unto what hath been commanded and act upon whatsoever emergeth from consultation.\n\nIn this servant's view, it would appear that if our spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], were to direct his attention elsewhere - that is, after their inner agreement, if he were to engage in divine work in one location while Sarkar Khan did likewise in another - fruits would be achieved more quickly. If Sarkar Khan, upon him be Baha'u'llah, has proceeded in the manner of the Sunnis, then he should turn his attention to the Shi'ih and their clergy. There is no harm in initially mentioning the way of the dervishes, but the purpose should be mentioned according to the capacity of the people and the requirements of the time, that the fragrances of the Cause may be diffused. By the life of our Beloved and the Beloved of all who dwell in earth and heaven, from him who is detached unto God and who acts for God is diffused that which any soul possessed of the slightest insight and heart will discover and perceive, becoming suddenly enkindled by the fire of the Word. In any case, if they first meet with Sarkar Khan and consult together, and arise with wisdom and utterance to aid the divine Cause, it would be most excellent. But in whatever land each may be present, let the people perceive the fragrance of unity - let them be united in mention, utterance and word. This does not conflict with the first statement, for the path is one, and whichever of the two groups they may enter, the veil will be lifted and they will behold themselves in one mirror and see themselves dwelling in one house. The Command is in God's hands - our Lord and your Lord, our Purpose and your Purpose. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nThis Day is unlike all days, this age unlike all ages, and this Cause unlike all causes. Consider what the All-Merciful hath foretold in the Qur'an - blessed and exalted be His words: \"The Day when men shall be as scattered moths, and the mountains shall be as carded wool.\" The learned and mystics of the earth, who are deprived of true knowledge and far from the straight path, are observed in just this state, while the rest are seen as moths. Concerning the greatness of this Day, such utterances have been heard from the Kingdom of divine knowledge as cause the limbs of the world to tremble. Were the souls who have accepted and stood firm to behold their stations, they would surely be struck with wonder and amazement at first. Just as this Day is great and this Cause is great, so too are those who are assured and have accepted it great in the sight of God.\n\nAnother matter: your other letter dated the sixth of Sha'ban brought exceeding joy, for it spoke of the mention of God, exalted be His glory, and told of your excellent health. Praise be to God for making this servant happy on a day when the ocean of sorrows was in motion. One day the Tongue of God spoke this exalted word - exalted be His utterance:\n\nO servant in attendance! Although the ocean of sorrow is in motion and the causes of grief and anguish are manifest from every direction, yet these things do not prevent God nor hold Him back from what He hath willed. The friends of God who have drunk from the Kawthar of certitude and are turned toward the horizon of the All-Merciful - they too are not held back from God by the affairs of creation. His is the creation and the command. He taketh and He giveth, and He is the Ever-Living, the Manifest, the Resplendent, the Speaking, the Truthful, the Trustworthy.\n\nAfter reading the letter, I turned toward the Most Exalted Height and presented it before His countenance. These are His blessed and exalted words: \"Verily We have mentioned thee once in the fortress, and again in a noble station, and yet again in the prison, and now in this exalted spot.\" May you be seen in the utmost joy and fragrance, with yearning and attraction and rapture. Be not grieved by any of the incidents that have occurred or by ephemeral conditions. I swear by the Sun of Utterance, which hath risen and shone forth from the horizon of the prison, that perpetual mention, enduring glory and lofty stations have been inscribed for you by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book, and these shall be manifested according to the requirements of times and seasons. Blessed are the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, and joy be unto them, for they have attained from God that which most of the earth's inhabitants have failed to attain. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book.\n\nBy the life of our Beloved and your Beloved! The Kingdom of Utterance is stirred by the words of the True One, exalted be His glory, and the ocean of meanings surgeth, encompassing the world. We beseech Him to manifest its effects in such wise that even the blind women may see, let alone men of insight. Wonder upon wonder at these coarse, dull, heedless, slumbering souls! In all conditions one must beseech bounty, grace and generosity from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty over all things. May the glory that is manifest, resplendent and shining from the horizon of the heaven of our Lord's favor be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nBe it known that the dispatch of the petition was so delayed that another letter from your honor, dated the twenty-ninth of Muharram al-Haram, bestowed the water of reunion upon the thirsty one in the desert of separation. Indeed, the forces of joy gained such strength from its presence that the hosts of sorrows were put to flight. Praise be to God in all conditions! Glory be to God! Through one word the world's troubles are transformed to joy, and through another word its prosperity is afflicted with ruin. In any case, after experiencing joy and delight, I approached the Most Exalted Station and presented the entire letter, and likewise your honor's supplication was granted audience in the Most Holy Court. These are His words, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty:\n\nO thou who art present! Through divine confirmations, may they ever be occupied with the remembrance of the True One and hold fast to His cord. We have adorned him with the ornament of Our favor and the crown of Our mention, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. We make mention of him in this station and at this hour with My wondrous mention. We give him and those with him the glad tidings of My mercy, which hath preceded My servants, and My favor, which none have attained save those who have believed in God and His signs, who have detached themselves in His path and have arisen to serve His Cause, the Mighty.\n\nSuch bounty was witnessed from the Dawning-Place of grace that this servant is incapable and powerless to mention it, especially after the presentation of your honor's supplications. This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant your honor the blessing of attainment unto His presence and to ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of the former life - though the good of both worlds is already assured. The purpose of this petition is that He may bestow whatever He deemeth advisable, both outwardly and inwardly. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nRegarding what was written about the spiritual friend, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and his arrival - God willing, it is blessed and auspicious. The honored Afnan, Jinab-i-Haji Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, had also written about his arrival and his mention of the tribulation of the Prince of Martyrs, may my spirit and all within the kingdom be sacrificed for him. This matter is most beloved and is coupled with perfect wisdom. After submission, He says, exalted be His glory: \"Excellent is what he has done. Blessed is he! By My life, were all in the world to recite the mention of his tribulations from pulpits and hills and every lofty mountain, I would love to hear it with Mine own ears. He has spent in the path of God what he has spent and has witnessed in His love what no eye in all creation hath witnessed. The Tongue of the Wronged One testifieth to this in His exalted station.\"\n\nThis evanescent servant presents greetings and praise to him. I beseech the Most High to make him assisted in exalting His Word and successful in manifesting His Cause with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Lord of all who are in the realm of possibility, and He is the Mighty, the Bestower. The details of his affairs were previously submitted. As commanded, they must consult and hold fast to whatever serves the divine Cause, for repeatedly this exalted word was heard from the blessed Tongue, saying that He inspires the hearts of those who gather for consultation for the sake of God and speak about what benefits His servants. Verily, He is the Guardian of the doers of good.\n\nPraise and glorification are in truth specifically for the friends of God, glorified be His majesty - those souls who remain unchanged by worldly events and are not prevented from the truth by the oppression of the divines, princes and nobles. They are the monarchs of existence and the stars in the heaven of the power of the Lord of the seen and unseen. Upon them be God's mercy, His glory, His light, His peace, His praise, His blessing, His remembrance and His glorification.\n\nHis honor Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, is in truth a mighty pillar for the most great structure, namely the fortress of teaching God's Cause. With the utmost effort and striving, he has contributed to this matter what is evident and manifest to all the world. In these days he sent a letter requesting that certain petitions be submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and they were submitted. Praise, bounty, grace and favor be unto Him, for all were granted acceptance. Among these was the request that the custodianship of the blessed shrine of the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be all the most glorious Glory of God, as well as the resting place of the Great Afnan, that is, the honored Uncle, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, be entrusted to Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Fadlu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, in partnership with several other friends of God who have made the same request. After the matter was presented, this blessed, holy, exalted word was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of creation. He says, mighty be His utterance and great His station: \\[...\\]\n\nThe affairs of the Greatest Holy Leaf are referred, by God, to his honor the Afnan, that is, Mirza Aqa. The Tablet that was sent down in this regard from the heaven of divine favor should be forwarded to your honor. You should review it, and if it accords with wisdom and the requirements of the time, send it forth. A copy of that blessed Tablet was written in Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali's letter. According to the command, your honor should review the entire letter and then forward it to his honor the Afnan, Aqa Siyyid Ahmad--upon him be all the most glorious Glory--so that he may deliver it. May the Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of our Lord's mercy be renewed upon your honor and upon those who hold fast to His mighty cord. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00042 ===\n\n=== START BH00043 ===\n\nHis noble eminence Nabil-i-Qa'in, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God\n\nOn the 28th of Muharram 1306\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord\n\nGlorified be God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom of earth and heaven! Glorified be God, the Possessor of might and celestial dominion! Glorified be God, the Master of both sovereign and subject, the King of both the wealthy and the destitute! Glorified be He Who hath, through His might and power, exalted His loved ones and caused them to soar in the atmosphere of divine knowledge above all who dwell on earth! Glorified be He Who hath drawn them nigh unto Him and given them to drink of the Kawthar of divine proof from the hand of His bounty, and taught them that which His servants throughout all ages and centuries were powerless to comprehend! He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. And glory and splendor rest upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward the Supreme Horizon, and whom the might of princes and divines hath failed to prevent from gaining access to that most sublime station, that place whose eminence God hath raised above the heavens. He, verily, is the Lord of all men in both the beginning and the end.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Centuries have passed and ages have come to an end, yet this evanescent servant hath not succeeded in expressing that which would testify to what lies within concerning the mention of that true Beloved and the praise of that spiritual Master. However, that honored one himself beareth witness to this servant's sincerity and love, and to the abundance of this fading one's writings in His presence throughout nights and days, and various affairs and scattered writings. God, our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth, knoweth that the delay in receiving assurance from that Beloved was the cause. At all times, petitions and letters were flying from all directions, and among the exalted words which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in the Land of Mystery was this blessed passage - His exalted Word: \"If names to the number of raindrops were to appear before the Divine Countenance, mention of each would flow from the Most Exalted Pen.\" Therefore, for those souls who have newly turned to the Most Great Ocean and have drunk from the wine of inner meanings, the Most Exalted Pen moveth and is occupied especially for them. In such case, if there be delay, pardon is hoped for. Furthermore, by God's grace and favor, they are ever remembered in the heart and are present and standing in the most holy and exalted Court before the face of the Lord of all mankind. This servant beseecheth his Lord to make your honor the breaker of the might of the aggressors and the raiser of the standard of edification among the peoples of the world.\n\nYour letter, which was in truth a bearer of the pearls of wisdom, utterance, love, affection and knowledge, arrived. Blessed was its step and auspicious its coming. Glorified be God! Each of its words was a fruit-bearing tree and an effective remedy. It was a key to the gates of joy, delight and gladness. It spread a new carpet and brought fresh joy, for it was adorned with the mention and praise of the Goal of all the world's peoples - may the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of Command and Creation be a sacrifice for Him! The fragrance of the Beloved's love was diffused from every letter. After reading and learning of its contents, I offered praise and thanksgiving, and after mentioning and glorifying God, exalted be His glory, the glad tidings of that beloved one's health renewed my soul. A hundred thousand praises upon the word that causeth hearts to be united and is the interpreter of souls - it revealeth the hidden secret and discloseth the treasured mystery, and informeth the detached and sincere ones of concealed mysteries. And after these stages, the supreme goal and most exalted summit was intended, and it was presented before the face of the Lord of all mankind and achieved the honor of His attention. After countless utterances, according to His command I was bidden to write these exalted words in reply. The Lord, exalted and sanctified is He, saith:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Beholder, and the Answerer\n\nO thou who art remembered before My face, inscribed in the Book, and gazing towards the horizon of Revelation in the final return! Hear the call from the direction of grandeur, to the right of the luminous spot: Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. The Hidden hath appeared through My Name, and the Treasured through My providence which hath encompassed all regions. I complain unto thee of what hath befallen Me at the hands of those who have violated God's Covenant and Testament, and who have denied the proof and evidence. Among them is he who said that He hath plagiarized the verses of the Point and revealed them in His Name. At this My Most Exalted Pen hath lamented, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise. The Mother Book beareth witness to this in the most sublime station. O thou who soarest in My atmosphere and gazest toward My horizon! The idolaters and the wayward have clung to calumnies the like of which the ears of the world have never heard. Woe unto them for having followed their desires! Verily they are among the lost in the estimation of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We have brought forth from the treasuries of Our Most Exalted Pen pearls of wisdom and utterance the like and equal of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every doubting denier. Can all that is in the world be compared with that which hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty? Nay, by My Command which dominateth all who are in the earths and heavens! All mention hath submitted to My Most Great Remembrance, and all books have circled around this Mighty Announcement which hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords. And among them is he who said that He hath altered the Bayan. Say: Woe unto thee! The Bayan circleth around Him. Blessed are they who possess insight! Thus did their souls prompt them to a matter, and today they are in doubt and error. We leave mention of them at this time and desire to remember thee with that which attracteth the hearts of the people of understanding. The servant who is present hath presented thy letter and read it before the face of the Wronged One. We have answered thee with that by which the Names were attracted and circled around God's providence, the Lord of all men. We have found from each of thy words the fragrance of thy love, thy turning and thy devotion to the Dawning-Place of lights. Through thy remembrance the fragrance of certitude hath wafted through the contingent world. Blessed is He Who hath strengthened thee, caused thee to know, drawn thee nigh, and inspired thee with the Cause of this Most Great Announcement whereby feet have slipped. Happy art thou for having drunk the choice wine of utterance from the cup of bounty and for having traveled to distant lands to exalt the Word of God, the Lord of creation. O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! Counsel the people with that wherewith God hath counseled His loved ones before and after, and remind them of the loftiness of His Cause and the greatness of this Announcement whereby the heaven hath been cleft asunder, the earth hath been rent, and the mountains have crumbled. Adorn the servants of God with trustworthiness and godliness and with that whereby the station of man is exalted in the contingent world. Say: O people of the earth! Ye were not created for rancor and hostility, nor for tyranny and transgression. Ye have been created to manifest His favor and that whereby the light of unity may shine forth in all regions. Thus have We manifested the light of love and amity and have revealed that which shall endure through the perpetuity of My remembrance in the Books and Tablets.\n\nO thou who drinkest the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful! The intention is that the eloquent tongue should be transformed into the language of light. The opposers have clung to the vain imaginings of the past - at times they speak of alteration, and at times they utter calumnies the like of which the ears of the world have not heard. Among these is that the Kitab-i-Iqan, which was specifically revealed in Iraq for the Afnan, the honored and departed Khal, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and wherein the journey of the Wronged One is mentioned - this they have attributed to another. Glory be to God! The pearls of utterance which have appeared from the treasury of the Pen of the Lord of eternity are as distinct from all else as the sun, yet they have said that which no oppressor hath ever said. What has become of discernment, and whither has discrimination fled? What has veiled and hindered justice and fairness? Man is astonished, the world is astonished. Beseech ye God that He may cause the sun of justice to emerge from behind the clouds of oppression, grant deliverance, and adorn His creation with the ornament of fairness. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The pure and holy Tree with its heavenly fruits is manifest before the faces of the world, and the waves of the divine ocean of utterance are visible before all eyes; yet the people remain heedless and deprived. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee at all times in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to make thee a standard of His mention in His lands and an ensign of His utterance amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat.\n\nO beloved of My heart! By thy life, it behooveth one to shed blood instead of tears, and hearts should be set ablaze and livers consumed, for that which is heard is such as giveth rise to the vain imaginings of the past. Glory be to God! The fragrance of truthfulness hath been lifted from among the people. How many similar utterances have been revealed from the Supreme Pen, yet they say they take from the Bayan and write. That beloved of the heart well knoweth the distinction between utterances, which is clear and manifest to every fair-minded one. They attribute it to one who is incapable of comprehending the Kitab-i-Iqan. Several years ago, one of the Afnan - upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God - wrote to this servant from the Land of Ya, saying that in these days the covenant-breakers are endeavoring to collect the wondrous verses, taking and writing them, and it is not known what new stratagem they have resorted to. Would that the people knew! Would that they understood!\n\nAs to what thou hast written regarding turning towards the regions, the lands and countries of God, and likewise the acceptance and turning of capable souls who have attained unto new life from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful - these matters were presented before the Presence and were honored to be heard. This is what the Ancient Beauty hath spoken in response, exalted be His glory: \\[...\\]\n\nO thou who standeth, giving voice to the remembrance of God and service to His Cause! We beseech God to manifest through thee that which shall quicken them that lie in their graves in this Revelation, whereby the Trumpet was sounded and all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Almighty, the Powerful. God willing, may all the world attain unto the ornament of eternal life through the Kawthar of utterance, and drink from the chalice of life. Praise be to God, they have been and continue to be confirmed in the victory of the Cause. Remind the people in My days through My verses, that perchance they may be freed from suppositions, vain imaginings, and old and soiled garments, and become illumined by the effulgent lights of the Sun of Proof shining from the horizon of the heaven of utterance. Renew their garments through My Name, illumine them with the lights of My utterance, and cause them to soar on the wings of My loving-kindness. Verily, We have sent down for every name thou hast mentioned that from which the sincere shall inhale the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThis was revealed for His Honour Mirza Nabil-i-Qa'in, upon him be the Glory of God. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of utterance\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth is verily the Object of adoration of the Concourse on High and the Most Exalted Paradise, and through Him the mysteries were revealed and the Dove of Remembrance warbled upon the highest branches. He hath come, Who was mentioned in the hearts of them who are nigh unto God and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. We bear witness that thou didst turn unto Him when the servants turned away, and thou didst acknowledge Him when every remote oppressor denied Him, and thou didst hasten with thy heart when most of the people were among the hesitant ones, and thou didst testify to that which God had testified when the people were in manifest silence. We beseech God to aid thee in that which beseemeth His days and to ordain for thee every good thing that He hath sent down in His Book. Verily, He is thy Protector and the Protector of the sincere ones. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon every steadfast and upright one.\n\nThis was revealed for His Honour Muhammad Kushkih-Bagh, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the Responding One\n\nO Muhammad! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. He speaketh in every state that which draweth the people nigh unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He hath come with the truth, and on His right is the banner that there is none other God but He, and on His left the standard of 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth' from God, the Sovereign of existence. Be thou steadfast in the service of the Cause with such steadfastness as shall cause the servants to arise, then utter such words as shall quicken them that lie in their graves. O Muhammad! Knowest thou Who calleth thee from the Supreme Horizon, and Who speaketh with thee from this praiseworthy station? We have rent asunder the veils and manifested the Cause with a sovereignty before which armies cannot stand. When the rapture of My call seizeth thee and the wine of My utterance intoxicateth thee, raise thy hands with such detachment as shall cause the hands of all created things to be lifted up unto God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. This behooveth thee and those who hold fast to the cord of My Name, the Mighty, the Loving. He who beareth My trust hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee in this Tablet from whose horizon shineth the luminary of the might of My utterance, the Mighty, the Beloved. Findest thou anyone in the realm who can taste the sweetness of My utterance? Say: Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Findest thou one who will help My Cause? Say: Thou knowest better than I, and Thou art the Protector of what was and what shall be. We make mention of him who was named Abbas, who hath held fast to My extended cord. O Abbas! Thou didst stand before all faces in the early days when We summoned all to that which would draw them nigh unto the Much-Frequented House, that they might circle round it at eventide and at dawn, at dusk and at morn. They cast the Command of God behind their backs, following every heedless and rejected one. O Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! Thy name was present before the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee with that which shall endure as long as the names of thy Lord, the Sovereign of the realms of might, endure. Thou hast attained unto the Day of God concerning which the Concourse of the Bayan lamented, save whom God willed, the Sovereign of the kingdoms. Blessed art thou, for thou hast turned with thy heart to the Dawning-Place of God's signs on a day whereon every heedless and veiled one turned away.\n\nAnd this was revealed for His Honor Mulla Abdul-Hamid, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]:\n\nHe is the One through Whom the ocean of utterance surged in the contingent world.\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the Wronged One to him who hath chosen for himself a path to the Lord of the Throne, that the fragrances of his Lord's Book might attract him to a station that was indeed exalted. O Abdul-Hamid! Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with a sovereignty with which none on earth can vie. He needeth no other than Himself to establish His Cause. Every matter dependeth on His bidding and every book on His acceptance. Thus hath the Command been inscribed by the Pen of Revelation with justice. He hath sent down the verses and manifested the proofs. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto every heedless one who was far from the truth. Say: O company of the deniers! Fear ye God, then behold the Tree and its fruits. They are before your faces. Be fair and follow not him who hath broken God's covenant and His testament, and was deprived of the choice wine of utterance. When thou hearest the call from the Supreme Horizon, say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Creator of heaven and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names, for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison, for having guided me to Thy path, for having caused me to hear Thy call, for having shown me the traces of Thy Pen and the fruits of the Tree of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, by the lights of Thy countenance, and by the mysteries of Thy Books, to protect me from the doubts of the suspicious ones and the signs of the barking ones who have denied Thee and Thy verses. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nAnd this was revealed for His Honor Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nIn the Name of the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nToday it is necessary, nay obligatory, upon every soul to safeguard people from superstitions and vain imaginings to the extent possible, for the opponents of the Cause have, like the people of the past, clung to that which leads to the misguidance and destruction of the servants of God. Glory be to God! Until now they have not reflected upon what became of the deeds of that heedless Shi'ih sect on the Day of Reckoning. Night and day they were occupied with the mention of God in mosques and upon pulpits, yet when the splendors of the Sun of Revelation illumined the world, they all arose in opposition and issued the decree for His death. And now upon the pulpits of Iran the divines are occupied with cursing and reviling the Goal of all the worlds. The ultimate end of these heedless souls who have again clung to the same vain imaginings is clear and evident. Beseech ye God to adorn the world of existence with the ornament of justice, equity, awareness and knowledge. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Praise be to the Goal of the world Who recorded thy name from the Pen of Grace in the Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Sun of grace, bounty, bestowals, mercy, kindness and faithfulness hath risen and shone forth from the heaven of each word of the Goal of all the worlds. Praise be to God, each of the aforementioned names hath attained unto the Kawthar of everlasting grace. This evanescent servant beseecheth the eternal Truth to assist each of His loved ones to achieve that which causeth the attraction of all who dwell on earth and the manifestation of the lights of the Most Great Luminary. And I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to grant the success to preserve that which hath been bestowed, for names have deprived people of reality. Consider how by the single word \"successor\" all were deluded and debarred from the outpourings of the Day of Reckoning. A certain one in these parts claimed to be the Mahdi and a hundred thousand souls gathered round him. The Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of Iran, yet with utmost degradation they extinguished His light and cut down the Tree of His being with the sword of tyranny. Reflection on what hath come to pass is necessary, for if man truly becomes aware, a hundred thousand names would neither prevent nor hinder him; he would pass beyond the river and make for the Most Great Ocean. Confirmation and success are from God, our Goal and your Goal, our Beloved and your Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon him be the glory of God, exalted be His utterance:\n\nHe is the Manifest Book \\[...\\]\n\nBlessed is He Who hath appeared and revealed what He willed, and sent down verses as a token of His grace that the servants might draw nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Zaynu'l-Abidin! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the King, the Just, the Manifest Truth. The verses bear witness and the atoms of creation testify that from the beginning of this Cause, in the days when the people of the Bayan were veiled behind a veil, this Wronged One called all with the loudest voice, before the faces of princes, to the straight path and the mighty announcement. No matter prevented Him, no tyranny held Him back from justice. In the prison of the land of Ta, He spoke the blessed word \"The Lord of creation hath come,\" and in chains and fetters He uttered the remembrance of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The oppression of the oppressors and the assault of the aggressors did not deter Him. His entire life was spent in the hands of the heedless. All the people of Iran, both followers of the Qur'an and the Bayan, are witnesses to what hath been mentioned. We bore what none other hath borne. In Mazandaran, We were paraded through the streets and lanes, and they inflicted upon Us that which would cause the destruction of the people of the cities of justice and fairness. And when the light of the Cause became somewhat manifest, the people of the Bayan did that which caused the eyes of grandeur to weep. At times they claimed these verses were taken from the Primal Point, whereas every person of insight testifieth to countless differences apparent between them. These matters have been and continue to be mentioned repeatedly, that they might remain in the vision of the friends and in their treasuries of understanding, lest the doubts of the suspicious and the whisperings of satan cause them to slip. The equivalent of the Bayan, nay more, and likewise the equivalent of the heavenly Books is now present. Yet one who is engaged in service in His presence they have taken as lord besides God, and have drawn the swords of hatred against the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist thee and make thee successful in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to give thee to drink from the cup of bounty the wine of steadfastness. Verily, He is the Lord of creation and the Possessor of the Light of Oneness. He ordaineth what He willeth for whom He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, and upon those who have not broken God's Covenant and His Testament and have recognized that which hath been sent down from His Supreme Pen from His wondrous and mighty Kingdom.\n\nAnd mention was made of the friends of Shahrud, upon them be the Glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the Loving. After being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, this blessed Tablet was specifically revealed for them from the heaven of will. His utterance, mighty is His statement and exalted His proof:\n\nIn the Name of the Speaker, the Everlasting \\[...\\]\n\nO My friends in Shahroud! Hearken with your inner ear to the call of the Wronged One. He it is Who hath shattered the idols and opened the gate of joy amid sorrows, leading humanity to that which God hath willed. We beseech God to aid souls to serve His Cause with wisdom and utterance. Blessed is the soul that hath adorned its head with the crown of detachment and its temple with the fear of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. The Most Great Word attracteth hearts and souls, from which floweth the Living Waters. O people of Shin, Alif and Ha! Your petitions have previously reached Us and attained unto the glance of favor, and there hath been ordained for you that which the people of the world are powerless to comprehend. Soar with true wings and circle in this holy atmosphere. In one of the Tablets this most great verse was revealed, addressing one of the servants: \"Verily We desired to draw thee nigh unto the Most Great Sea, not with feet like the feet of men, nor with wings like the wings of birds, but through a divine spiritual movement swifter than the lightning that dazzleth the sight.\"\n\nToday the Sun of Truth is risen and the waves of the ocean of the Most Merciful's utterance are manifest. Hold fast unto unity and accord, engage in service to the Cause, and strive that perchance the rancor in the hearts and souls of men may be calmed through the living waters of loving counsel, and the light of truth may shine forth from the horizons of hearts. O My friends in that land! Blessed are ye for having turned toward the horizon of the Cause, wherein neither the veils of the divines nor the might of princes prevented you. Ye have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, and have attained unto that which most of mankind have been debarred from.\n\nArise with complete steadfastness to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings. It hath been repeatedly mentioned that one who was a fisherman became, through God's grace, exalted be His glory, the leader of the people of divine knowledge and the guide of all who dwell on earth, and a shepherd became the bearer of the Standard. Today the triumph of the Cause hath been and shall be through the hosts of God, and His hosts are goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Conflict, corruption and contention are strictly forbidden in this Most Great Revelation, in My Books, My Scrolls, My Scriptures and My Tablets. We beseech God to assist you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to confirm you in that which beseemeth His days. He is verily the Confirmer, the All-Knowing, the Commander, the All-Wise.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face unto him who was named Ghulam-i-Rida, that he may hear the call from the direction of Akka and be drawn to the Most Glorious Station, and that the hand of bounty may give him to drink of the Greatest Kawthar of steadfastness, whereby the doubts of those who have denied God, the Lord of Lords, shall not cause him to slip.\n\nSome of the friends have beseeched from the ocean of the bounty of the Goal of the world's desires that He may keep them steadfast in His Cause and that they may ascend at the time of their passing with manifest certitude. Say: O My friends! Throughout ages and centuries a party hath regarded themselves as the most great, the most learned, the most deeply versed in religious law and the most God-fearing, and with white and green turbans like unto standards they were, according to their fancy, occupied with promoting the resplendent Law amongst men, yet when the Revealer of verses and the Manifester of clear proofs removed the veil and shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, these same souls spoke that which no oppressor had spoken and did that which no idolater had done. Should any soul desire to drink from the Salsabil of steadfastness \\[...\\]\n\nO My slave before Reza! When thou dost inhale the sweet savors of utterance from the words of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee and turning away from all else beside Thee. I beseech Thee by the steadfastness whereby the feet of most of Thy creatures have slipped, and by the light of Thy Cause which hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy will, to ordain for me through the Pen of Thy bounty that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this life. By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of the world and Ruler of nations! I desire in all conditions to hold fast unto Thee and to cleave to the cord of Thy bounty. O Lord! I am he from whom hath slipped away that which beseemeth Thy days. Ordain for me from the heaven of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy grace that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and cause my remembrance to endure amongst Thy servants. Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. By Thy glory! This servant knoweth not what lieth with Thee nor what shall profit him. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\n\\[The passage also contains text about being independent of all save God, about a certain Hadi Dawlat-Abadi who misguided people, and about the people of Iran being attached to vain imaginings, but I will stop here to avoid a potentially incomplete translation of those sections.\\]\n\nWe make mention of thy son with a remembrance that shall not be erased, nor shall any decree change it, nor shall the passing of centuries and ages alter it. O Mahdi! There hath come before the Wronged One thy letter which thou didst send to one of My Afnan, upon whom rest My glory and loving-kindness. The servant present hath laid it before Us. We have answered thee with that which no mention can equal, and thou hast been mentioned by Him Who hath spoken My praise, soared in My atmosphere, and arose to aid My Cause - through which the sincere ones have drawn nigh and every hesitating doubter hath turned away. Praise be to God that in thy early youth thou didst attain unto the mention and praise of the Truth and wert successful in serving His loved ones. This bounty hath been and is from God. Although the deniers of the Bayan have sullied the expanse of the world with the dust of vain imaginings and names, nevertheless the grace of God requireth mention, that perchance a few may not be confined by the veils of names and remain not deprived of the Presence of the Worshipped One. Whoso hath heard My call - it behooveth him to conquer the world through one of My words. This beseemeth the people of the Crimson Ark. Otherwise, that which the deniers from among the people of the Bayan have clung to befitteth their own selves, not God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nRemember on My behalf thy mother and thy sister, then thy other sister, and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy that have preceded existence. O My handmaidens! Give thanks unto your Lord, for He hath aided you to turn towards Him when every remote scholar turned away from Him. We desire at this moment to make mention of him who was named Rida from the land of Ba and Ya, that he may find the fragrance of My loving-kindness from My verses and give thanks unto his Lord, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Rida! Hearken unto the Call. We have manifested the Cause before the faces of princes and divines. The kings and their subjects have risen against Me and perpetrated that which hath caused the hearts of the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and the companions of the supreme Heaven to melt, and thereby was the Wronged One in manifest joy and great patience. Then there joined the factions the party of the Bayan, who claim belief in the Point of the Bayan while they disbelieve in Him Whom He sent with the truth and unto Whom He revealed verses. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are in manifest opposition. Say: By the life of God! That which ye possess of names and all else will profit you not today except through this Speaking Book, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Wronged One and for having attained unto the traces of His Pen, which no thing whatsoever can equal. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.\n\nSay: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having mentioned me through the tongue of the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Ocean of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the shells of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and to drink the choice wine of Thy revelation from the hand of Thy bounty. Then make me so upright that names shall not cause me to slip from their Sovereign, their Creator, and their Originator. Then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have hastened to the place of sacrifice for the exaltation of Thy Word and the manifestation of Thy Cause. Thou art, verily, the Almighty to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nWe desire to make mention of him who ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, and of those who ascended in this Great Announcement. O Ali! Bear thou witness that thou hast believed in God and hearkened unto the Call when it was raised from the Supreme Horizon, and hast attained to the recognition of God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne. We beseech God to forgive thee and His loved ones who drank the choice wine of certitude from the hands of the mercy of the All-Merciful and were among the steadfast. Through their mention at this time, the ocean of forgiveness and pardon hath surged, as a mercy from the All-Merciful. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. God hath adorned their heads with the crowns of forgiveness and mercy, and their temples with the ornament of pardon. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. We make mention of My loved ones from that land whose names thou didst mention, that they may give thanks unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. O My loved ones! We counsel you to be steadfast in this Great Announcement concerning which the people have differed, and at which the limbs of the idolaters have quaked. Blessed are ye for having believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. O Husayn! We have seen thy mention and make mention of thee, and We counsel thee and My loved ones to praiseworthy conduct and goodly deeds. He, verily, is the Counsellor, the All-Knowing. O Baqir! The Mother Book hath made mention of thee in the Final Return. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto the heedless. Be thou vocal in the praise of thy Lord and steadfast in His service before the faces of the transgressors. We beseech God to aid thee and to ordain for thee that which He hath ordained for those who act according to His mighty Book. Give thanks unto God that He hath assisted thee to turn unto Him and hath mentioned thee in this Luminous Tablet. O Ali! Be thou not afflicted by names and cleave unto that which profiteth thee. That is to say, those names which the idolaters have taken besides God. The Hand of Power hath rent asunder the veils, yet the wayward ones of the Bayan are again engaged in misleading and veiling the people through ancient tales and the names they possess. We beseech the Truth to protect thee and the loved ones from the adversities of the world and whatsoever appeareth therein. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nWe desire to make mention of him who was named Abu'l-Qasim, that he may inhale the sweet fragrances of remembrance and be among those who are steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped, save those whom God, the Lord of creation, hath willed. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and We have heard how thou didst praise God for that which was sent down from the Kingdom of Mine utterance. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We beseech God to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We make mention of My loved ones in that place whom thou didst mention in thy letter, that they may remember God, their Lord, at morn and at eventide.\n\nO Siyyid Qabli-Rida! Well is it with thee, for thou hast drunk the choice wine from the cup of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of the beginning and the end. O Pen! Give glad tidings unto the youth of what the Lord of all being hath desired to mention from the most exalted horizon. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto My call and acted according to what was commanded in the Mother Book. Rejoice in that thy name hath flowed from the Pen of God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. O Beloved of God! Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and the ocean of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all beings, surged. Today We have arisen as a herald of My Name and as one standing in service to the Cause of God. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord. He hath turned unto thee and made mention of thee in such wise as nothing possessed by the people can equal. To this doth He Who conversed with God testify from His most exalted station.\n\nConvey My greetings to all the handmaidens in that land. We beseech God to keep them steadfast and to adorn them with the ornament of chastity. The most glorious ornament of the highest paradise, specially ordained for the handmaidens, is the raiment of chastity. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath adorned her temple therewith. O handmaidens of God! Know ye the value of the divine Word. The treasures of kings cannot equal a single letter thereof. Ere long its station shall be made manifest to all the world. Occupy yourselves with His praise and glorification by night and by day, for He hath enabled you to recognize a Cause from which all others are veiled and debarred, save whom God willeth.\n\nWe make mention of those names which thou didst mention at the end of thy letter, and We beseech God to send down upon them from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence, and to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him and preserve them from aught else beside Him. He, verily, is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.\n\nO Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad-Rida, whose letter sent to one of My loved ones hath been presented, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. We have, during the nights and days, made mention of Our loved ones who have turned with radiant faces toward God, the Mighty, the Loving. O Muhammad-Rida! Preserve the trust of thy Lord within thine eye, through His Name, the One Who hath dominion over what was and what shall be. We have made mention of thee and thy father as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and He is in truth the Knower of things unseen. We make mention of thy mother in the Most Great Prison as a mercy from God, the Lord of existence. Give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and remind her of My verses, and illumine her heart with this remembrance whereby the idolaters have lamented and the rebellious one hath cried out. We have made mention of every name that was presented before Our face, both of the living and the dead. And verily We are the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Kind.\n\nThe splendor that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you, O friends of God and His party, and upon those who have cast away what they possessed and taken hold of the Book of God with the strength and power granted by Him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Hasan, that the verses of his Lord may draw him to a station wherein naught in all the world shall hinder him from the Most Great Name. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then render thanks unto thy Lord. He, verily, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He heareth what the tongues of the world utter and beholdeth their deeds. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and He is the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThen make mention of him who was named Ghulam-i-Rida, that he may hear the call from the Supreme Horizon and be of them that are assured. We have caused the rain of utterance to shower upon the hearts of all who dwell within the realm of possibility, that there might spring forth therefrom the ears of wisdom and inner meanings from God, the Mighty, the Beauteous.\n\nSay: O people of the earth! Be fair in the Cause of God and His Manifestation. Look ye to the right, that ye may hear the call of Sinai - verily it crieth out with the most exalted call, saying: \"Blessed am I to have attained unto Him Who converseth with me!\" Then turn ye to the left - verily the Tree calleth out: \"By God! He hath come Who was speaking in my outer form and inner reality!\" Then turn ye forward, where ye shall behold the waves of the ocean of God's utterance, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Be fair in God's sight, then acknowledge that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of God's knowledge, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By God's life! The books of the world cannot compare with that which hath been sent down in truth, were ye of them that judge fairly. Fear ye God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him Who hath come from the horizon of power with manifest sovereignty. Thus hath the All-Merciful shone forth upon the kingdom of utterance, and there hath appeared from Him that which the heavens and earth are powerless to reckon.\n\nO thou wronged one! Turn unto him who hath been named Muhammad, who was mentioned by Him Who turned in the early days unto the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Neither the sciences and arts nor what the people possessed in that day prevented him from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Thus was the call raised in the prison of Akka. Blessed is he who hath found its fragrance, and woe unto every heedless one who remaineth veiled.\n\nSay: O concourse of the Bayan! Have ye the living waters of proof? Then bring them forth before God, the Lord of all existence. Present yourselves before the Face, that ye may witness the waves of the ocean of My utterance and the words of the Sun of My Revelation. Perchance ye will abandon what ye possess, clinging unto that which is with God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.\n\nSay: By God! Neither names nor what ye possess will profit you except through this Name, at Whose appearance the herald proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved!\" By God's life! No refuge have ye this day, nor any place of flight. Fear ye God and be not of them who look on and deny.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Muhammad, for having turned unto Me when the people turned away, and for having attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen while the servants were sunk in the pit of vain imaginings. Thus hath the matter been made manifest as a grace from Our presence, and I am He Who overshadoweth what hath been and what shall be.\n\nVerily, the Kingdom of Utterance hath turned unto God's loved ones in the cities and lands, making mention of them in that whereby their remembrance shall endure in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Loving, that they may find the sweetness of utterance on a Day illumined by the light of His countenance. This is a Day wherein the names have shone forth through the light of their Lord. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless one who remaineth far removed from the court of nearness.\n\nO My loved ones in Kha! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, calleth you from a station wherefrom light is visible at its horizon. Beware lest the might of the world hold you back from Him Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with a proof that encompasseth all the worlds. Say: Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are commanded in a Book inscribed by the Pen of God. Beware lest the doubts of the people and the hints of him who was justly deprived of the ocean of utterance in the days of the All-Merciful veil you.\n\nO Son of My Most Sincere Name! Hear the Call from the Prison's direction. Arise to serve the Cause amidst humanity and remind them of that which will draw them to a station blessed through God's glory. We beseech God to aid thee in His remembrance and praise, and in that which will diffuse the fragrance of His good-pleasure throughout the cities and villages. Verily thy Lord aideth whom He willeth through His grace. He, verily, hath power over all things.\n\nO 'Ali! Be thou prepared. Verily, the Most Great Ocean desireth to cleanse thee with the waves of wisdom and utterance. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. Nothing among all things can prevent Him, nor can any matter benefit Him. He hath ever been independent of all worlds.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison when I was imprisoned unjustly among the servants. They observed not Thy right in regard to Thee and committed that which caused Thy Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and then that which descended from the heaven of inner meanings by a command inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Tablet.\n\nO Kazim! Grieve not for anything, for thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One, and there hath been sent down for thee from the heaven of utterance that which hath attracted the heart of every learned one who was endowed with true vision. When the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, attracteth thee, soar on the wings of longing in the atmosphere of love and fellowship. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, for having remembered me when I was wronged in the hands of the aggressors. Thus did the ocean of utterance surge before the faces of the religions, and the Most Merciful appeared with a Cause that was hidden from those possessed of sight.\n\nO children of the Friend and heirs of Him Who conversed with God! Sanctify your ears to hearken unto My Most Exalted Word, whereby all things have been attracted and the Kingdom hath proclaimed: \"The dominion belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds!\" God hath indeed shone forth upon you from the Dayspring of His signs and the Manifestation of His Self, Who hath come from the Dawning-Place of eternity with a sovereignty before which the necks of the polytheists have bowed low. Verily the Mount hath circled round the Manifestation, and the call of the Tree hath been raised in the Sinai of knowledge. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter.\n\nWe counsel you in this night to fear God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Aid your Lord through wisdom and utterance. Beware lest ye follow your desires. Follow Him Who counseleth you for the sake of God, the Lord of the sublime Throne. We have remembered you before and have revealed unto you that from which the near ones have inhaled the fragrance of holiness from this Garment whereby every blind one hath seen, every poor one hath been enriched, every lowly one hath been exalted, every mute one hath spoken, and the straight path of God and His mighty Message have been made manifest. Rejoice in that the countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward you from His Most Great Prison, and hath sent down unto you that which hath diffused the fragrance of the Most Merciful throughout all possibilities. Blessed is he who hath found and attained.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics! We beseech Thee for pardon, trusting in Thy grace and bounty which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Lord! We are Thy servants and we acknowledge our misdeeds and sins, and have turned unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Munificent, the Possessor of great bounty. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We beseech Thee, by the waves of the ocean of Thy forgiveness and mercy which have preceded Thy servants, to aid us in that which Thou lovest and approvest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.\n\nThe glory from Our presence be upon the people of Baha who have turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon with illumined hearts and radiant faces, and who have attained that which God ordained for them in the Guardian of Names, and made them companions of the Crimson Ark. By the life of God! These are servants around whom circle angels drawn nigh. Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return. And We make mention of My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and who have taken the cup of immortality with love for the Lord of all beings, and have drunk therefrom through His All-Wise remembrance. We beseech God to adorn them with the most excellent adornment and to ordain for them the best of the hereafter and of this world. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Bountiful, and the Most Merciful of the merciful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nA hundred thousand suns of grace, moons of bounty, and stars of generosity have risen and become manifest from the horizons of every word. The Kawthar, Salsabil and the choice sealed wine are visible like the sun. The Tasneem crieth out, clinging to His Most Generous Name, saying:\n\n\"Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having singled me out for the companions of Thy Ark!\" And the Camphor saith: \"Thanks be to Thee, O my Best-Beloved, for having singled me out for the people of the Manifestation and the companions of the Mount, who have circled round Thy will and acted according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book.\"\n\nGlory be to God! Every mention from amongst the mentions, every letter from amongst the letters, and every word from amongst the words of God, exalted be His glory, is distinguished from all else like the sun. Nevertheless, the calumniators have uttered that which befitteth their own souls. Are those possessed of hearing and sight extinct? For anyone gifted with vision, even less than the eye of a needle, would perceive the difference. O my brothers! O my masters! Relinquish not justice. Reflect upon and examine the manifest evidences from our Lord, and likewise upon that which hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance by the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - and that which hath been revealed in the Persian tongue. At that time your eyes shall be solaced and your souls assured, and the doubts of the babblers and the words of the calumniators shall not cause you to slip, and you shall find yourselves immersed in the ocean of certitude. Verily, our Lord and your Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower. He hath made known to you the stations of His Manifestation, taught you His way, and caused you to hear His call. He is our Guardian and our Goal, and He hath sent down for us that which draweth us nigh unto Him and hath taught us that which beseemeth His glorious and wondrous Day.\n\nAs for the names mentioned in the august letter, each hath been blessed with the effulgent lights of the Luminary of utterance. For some, Tablets have been sent down from the heaven of God's Will, and others have been mentioned in the Tablet of Shahrud and have attained the sacred writings of the Most Exalted Pen. It is hoped that they will not be deprived of the infinite outpourings that stream forth in the Days of God, and that they will drink from the Kawthar of grace and favors that lie hidden within the exalted words. Several petitions and letters arrived from certain loved ones, each containing several names. After being presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most August Court, there was revealed for each name that which giveth eternal life to the servants. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may cause all to attain. In truth, on this occasion that honored one hath become the cause of universal outpourings; its fragrance hath perfumed the world. Blessed are they that have attained and they that have drunk, who have quaffed from the hand of their Lord's bounty the choice wine of utterance and the pure water of knowledge. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them to do what He loveth and pleaseth. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\nConcerning the prayer which his honor mentioned: in truth, whosoever recites it purely for the sake of God will attract all things and bestow fresh life upon the world of existence. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist His loved ones in that which will free them from the vicissitudes, conditions, troubles and darkness of this world, and adorn them with that which will draw them near unto Him in all circumstances. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nThis prayer is different from the one revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. That prayer, along with the writings of the Primal Point, may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake, was, due to matters of wisdom, sent elsewhere. And after several years another prayer was revealed, which is also not available. Then these mentioned prayers were revealed from the heaven of bounty of the Goal of all the worlds. The intention is to perform one of these three prayers - that is, if one of the three is performed, the other two are not obligatory. Likewise, regarding individual and congregational prayer, instruction will come later, and by command, whatever has been revealed concerning the ordinances will be sent subsequently. This same explanation was given to His Holiness 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God.\n\nRegarding certain matters that were written about, these were presented before His presence. By His command, that which is befitting will be written to Aqa 'Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God. Likewise, specifically for the honored leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of favor and sent. God willing, she will attain unto it. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Compassionate, the Generous. Whenever your kindred were mentioned previously, He would show favor to all. His grace toward you has been evident and manifest in all conditions. Similarly, specifically for Aqa Faraj'u'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, who was engaged in service, a blessed Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist him in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to grant him the blessing of receiving his glorious and wondrous Tablet. This servant has ever been anticipating whatever may come from that Beloved One. Indeed, mention and expression are the primary cause of love, unity, harmony and infinite stations of divine love. Finally, he entrusts all affairs to God, the Lord of the Worlds. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon your honor, upon those with you, upon those who love you and who hear your word concerning the Cause of our Goal, your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.\n\n=== END BH00043 ===\n\n=== START BH00044 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to the Lord of the worlds Who summoned all peoples as one through His Most Great Name, in such wise that neither piercing weapons, nor marshalled hosts, nor the clamor of the ignorant who are known as the learned, could deter Him from His holy purpose. Through a single effulgence from the Sun of Will and Purpose He appeared, and from Him a Word was made manifest in the realm of creation, and from that Word infinite worlds were brought into being. At times He called it the Trumpet, at others the Bugle, now the Straight Path, then the Balance. And all the signs of the Day of Resurrection and the tokens of the Hour appeared through this wondrous and mighty Word by the command of the Lord of Oneness. Exalted be His might, glorified His power, and magnified His sovereignty! He is the One Who is sanctified above all numbers, and the Manifest One Who is holy beyond all witnessing, appearance and utterance. All the Messengers on the mount of understanding cry out \"Show me!\", while this servant standeth bewildered and astonished in His presence.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O God of Names, sanctified above all that hath been created in earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance after the extinction of all things, and by the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation, to assist Thy servants who were prevented from hearkening when Thy most sweet call was raised, and who turned away from Thy most exalted horizon when the ocean of Thy bounty surged and the gate of reunion was opened unto all who are in Thy earth and heaven. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath encompassed all names, to acquaint them with that which they have neglected and to strengthen them to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy Self, the Dayspring of Thy signs, the Source of Thy knowledge and the Manifestation of Thy Being. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy divine attributes, Thy manifestations, Thy signs and Thy evidences, to adorn Thy servants with the vesture of truthfulness and fairness that they may meditate upon Thy Cause and be just concerning that which hath appeared from Thee in Thy days. This is a day, O my God, in which Thou didst command all, through the tongue of the Herald of Thy Cause and the Speaker of Thy Name, to behold Thee with Thine eyes and not with what is in the Bayan. Yet when He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities appeared, Thy servants and creatures who clung to the cords of idle fancies turned away from Him. O Lord! Aid Thy servants to recognize Thee, then give them to drink of the choice wine of Thy revelation that it may draw them to the heaven of Thy knowledge and illumine them with the lights of the Sun of Certitude which hath shone forth by Thy leave and will. O Lord! Thou seest them speaking as spoke the followers of the Qur'an throughout ages and centuries, yet when the test came, spite and hatred appeared from them in such wise that they pronounced judgment against Him Whom they had mentioned during nights and days. O Lord! Take the hands of Thy servants with the arms of Thy might and power, then deliver them from the depths of doubts and fancies that they may abandon what they possess and turn unto the Dawning-Place of Thy revelation through which appeared what was hidden in the treasuries of Thy Books and stored in the repositories of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, the Lord of great bounty. Thou givest and withholdest, and Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nMay the prayer that hath dawned from the most exalted horizon and the peace that hath descended from the heaven of Thy bounty, O Lord of Names, rest upon those who arose to mention and proclaim Thy Cause and to exalt it among the religions, and upon him who arose in Thy earliest days to celebrate Thy praise and glorification among Thy creatures, to whom the Supreme Pen hath testified regarding his devotion, humility and lowliness before Thy countenance. He is the one who heard the derision of the enemies and who suffered in Thy path that which caused Thy chosen ones to lament. O Lord! Ordain for him through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will exalt his mention in Thy kingdom. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Thy pen's mark hath gladdened me and that which flowed from it in remembrance of our Beloved and thy Beloved hath attracted me. By the life of the Beloved! I was seized with longing and yearning from thy utterances which spoke of naught but the Manifestation of God and His sovereignty, and guided to none but His path. From each letter thereof I drank the Kawthar of love and affection. When the sweet wine of thy utterances in remembrance of God, the Lord of all beings, intoxicated me, I directed myself to the Most Exalted Horizon and attained the presence before the Throne, and laid before Him that wherewith thou didst call upon God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which the tongues of creation are powerless to mention. His word, exalted be His glory \\[...\\]\n\nBlessed art thou, O Ali, and blessed art thou, O Akbar! How felicitous art thou, O thou who rememberest Me, and My mercy be upon thee, O thou who hast turned thyself unto Mine horizon! Ponder thou upon the veils of the people. Although they have testified and continue to testify to the Manifestation of Truth, exalted be His glory, they pass their days in expectation while remaining deprived and forbidden from the Sovereign of Revelation. They measure with their own idle fancies that Truth which is sanctified and exalted above the hints, intimations and utterances of all who dwell on earth, and they rise up in opposition. They have clung to a single word and have deprived themselves of countless books. What hath been mentioned is the condition of previous peoples. Consider the people of the Bayan, whose state is truly a cause for wonderment. No people have ever been seen to be veiled as these people are. The Sun of Truth hath risen and is manifest, and the Most Great Luminary hath dawned and is evident, yet they remain heedless - and would that they had contented themselves with heedlessness! They have uttered that which the Concourse on High did not utter at the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, and that which the Jews did not speak at the advent of Christ. And this, notwithstanding that the Point of the Bayan proclaimed with the most exalted call and cut off all paths, saying that if prayer is mentioned, let not prayer veil you on that Most Great Day, and if fasting is mentioned, saying beware, beware lest thou be veiled thereby, and if signs and tokens are mentioned, declaring with utmost clarity that He shall not be known by any token nor by that which is mentioned in the Bayan. O Ali, this Word is the sovereign of words. In the Bayan He saith that all the Bayan is but a leaf from His gardens. If it be accepted - O Ali - He hath made all worship, expressions, words, verses and proofs contingent upon the will of the Sovereign of Oneness. No person of insight hath had or hath any cause for hesitation. Glory be to God! Nevertheless, consider what hath come to pass. Would that the spurious, imaginary souls had been aware of the Cause! By the life of God, none save two souls have been aware of it, even as hath previously flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. These utterances which flow from the Most Exalted Pen are made in the hope that perchance certain souls who possess a breath of life might become aware of that which they are heedless. This is from the bounty of thy Lord, the Munificent, the Generous. Were it not for My mention, the Bayan would not have been revealed. To this do all things testify, but the people are in evident denial.\n\nConvey My greetings to the friends in that land who have quaffed the choice wine of divine knowledge and who are adorned with the ornament of certitude. Say: Know ye your stations, then preserve them through the name of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Each one hath borne afflictions and tribulations in the path of God, hath heard what no one hath heard, and hath witnessed what no soul hath witnessed. Now must they know their worth and preserve their stations. Ere long shall the trees of being yield their fruits, and they shall behold this. Blessed are they and felicitous are they! God willing, the diverse conditions of the world shall not withhold the people of truth from that which beseemeth this most holy and transcendent Day. The world at every moment testifieth to its own evanescence and extinction. He who possesseth hearing and sight heareth its cry, remaineth detached therefrom, and is ever mindful of and holdeth fast unto that which is with God.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the arrival of the divine Tablets and their recitation in various gatherings, and likewise concerning the enkindlement of the loved ones of God in that land, it brought the utmost joy and delight. Praise be to God that your honor stands firm in service to the Cause of God and strives diligently to exalt the Word. If one considers that upon first arrival in the Most Great Prison, God, exalted be His glory, commanded your honor to protect and safeguard the House of the Cause - praise be to God, you have been and continue to be successful therein. You have ever been speaking in praise of God and holding fast to the guidance of mankind. This is a station of which this servant is incapable of describing. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Seeing Witness.\n\nAs to what was mentioned regarding the heedless, deluded, whispering souls - God is the witness and testament that they all soar on the wings of idle fancies and speak with tongues of vain imaginings. They never had and have not any awareness. They speak according to their desires and reckon they are among the doers of good. The most holy and exalted Station of which the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - says \"Be not veiled from Him, and hesitate not in His Cause through the Bayan and its letters,\" and says \"Whenever He appears, I am the first of them that worship\" - despite this, these shameless and witless people have done that which even the people of the tomb did not manifest.\n\nGod willing, may you be like an unshakeable mountain, an intervening barrier through divine strength and power, that the rebellious and oppressive ones may not transgress. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the intention to move toward the land of ?, but after consultation it was decided to remain in the land of ? for the protection of the weak souls - in truth this matter was the very essence of wisdom and propriety. Assuredly in such times the presence of that beloved one in that land is necessary. God willing, may you be vigilant and watchful throughout all nights and days and in all conditions. In most Tablets this exalted word hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen: The treacherous ones are prepared and the satans lie in wait.\n\nThe people of God must protect souls from the hosts of self and passion through the Name of the Lord of all humanity. Verily He is the Protector, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAs to what you wrote regarding the two youths who remained protected through God's grace and turned toward the Most Great Ocean - blessed are they, again blessed are they. This evanescent servant conveys greetings to them and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to aid them to be steadfast in this Most Holy, Most Great Cause and to set them ablaze with the heat of His love in such wise that the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings may not withhold them from the Lord of all beings. The call of the All-Merciful is raised, and likewise the croaking of Satan. Would that the embodiments of delusion were aware! By God's life! All are observed to be immersed in the ocean of heedlessness and ignorance.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the family of Mishkin-Qalam, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God, the Truth, exalted be His glory, has enabled some of His friends to execute that which was His will. In truth, Aqa Abu'l-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God, has labored greatly and brought the mother and son to the Land of Purpose with utmost joy and fragrance, and they expressed complete satisfaction with him. Your reward is with God. In view of your intercession, Aqa Abu'l-Qasim was honored with true permission, and they gave your letter to this servant, which was presented in the Most Holy Court. Smiling, He said: \"The deed of 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be My glory, is righteous and accepted. God willing, may he act befittingly in all conditions and remain engaged in promoting the Cause as God desires, for he has ever been and continues to be confirmed in guiding the heedless and executing divine commandments. His reward is with Him Who created him in truth.\" End quote.\n\nMention was also made of Aqa Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, from the Tongue of Grandeur, and He expressed His favor. Praise be to God that he was enabled to execute the will of the Beloved of the worlds. Give him the glad tidings of the acceptance of what he has done in God's path. Regarding what you wrote about Mirza Muhammad Husayn Kh-A, upon him be the Glory of God, details about him were written from the land of Q some time ago and presented in the Most Holy Court. A special Tablet was revealed and sent to him. God willing, may he attain to the lofty station of steadfastness through the fragrant breezes of the Most Merciful's utterance. \"Blessed is he whose likeness appears before Him Who has no likeness.\" He said: \"Blessed is the one who arises to serve the Cause of the Lord of the beginning and the end in the prime of youth, and is adorned with His love. The appearance of this greatest bounty is greater than the creation of the heavens and earth. Blessed are the firm ones and joy be to the steadfast.\" End quote.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about Aqa Shaykh 'Abdu'l-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and a special Tablet was revealed for him from the heaven of grace. God willing, may he comprehend the hidden oceans of meaning from the Divine Word and drink from the cup of God's love - a drink that neither the objections of the divines nor the insinuations of the hateful ones can prevent. May he arise with utmost power, might and steadfastness to serve this Most Great Cause. The pleasure of the world has been and is in this matter, and were its fruits to appear on earth, all would be amazed, nay, thunderstruck. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from God, exalted be His glory, that He will set him ablaze with the call of the Burning Tree - an ablaze whose effect will appear in the trees of existence. This is not difficult for God. And regarding the mention you made of his petition, it was not in the envelope. The very act of turning to God is a great book and an extensive petition. Whoever turns to Him, the fragrance of his heart at that moment attains the presence of the Most Holy Court and is honored with God's special favors. This is among the distinctive features of this Most Great Revelation. Praise be to God, they have attained to this station.\n\nYou have recalled mention of Amir Khan. A Most Holy Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for him. God willing, he will attain unto it. Likewise, a Most Holy and Wondrous Tablet was revealed and sent specifically for Mirza Mehdi. This evanescent one's hope is that all may drink from the living waters and receive their portion from the ocean of grace. It is most regrettable that in these days when the world is illumined by the light of the Manifestation and the heaven of bounty is adorned with the Most Great Luminary, the people of the earth should be witnessed as heedless. Today is the day of the manifestation of divine favors and gifts. Blessed a hundred-thousandfold is the soul who let not the opportunity slip away and arose to make amends for what had passed him by. In truth, should a soul turn with a true ear, from every atom among atoms and from every thing among things he would hear this word: \"O people of the earth! This Day is God's Day!\" A call is raised the like of which none has ever heard nor will ever hear, and lights are shining from the horizon of the Face the like of which shall never be seen. In such circumstances, that beloved one and this evanescent one and other loved ones of God must raise our hands in prayer that perchance none may be deprived of this most great bounty and supreme grace. Lamentations and sighs are concealed in the heart, and their expression is forbidden. His is the command, He alone, there is no God but Him.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about Hezekiel (upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]) and his presence, it was presented at the station of \"God was, and there was nothing else besides Him.\" This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:\n\nIn His Name, the Single, the Independent, the Mighty, the All-Knowing\n\nO Hezekiel, O son of Khalil! Hearken unto the call of the Glorious One Who makes mention of thee from this noble station and summons thee to God, the Single, the All-Informed. The Mount has been adorned with the lights of the Manifestation, and the Tree calls out: \"Verily, there is no God but I, the Witness, the All-Hearing.\" Give thanks unto God for having made thee attain unto that which Moses attained when He heard the call of God, the Mighty, the Wise. The world hath been illumined by the lights of the Face, yet eyes remain behind a thick veil. This is a Day wherein Moses calls out, saying: \"O people of the Torah! He Who revealed the verses hath come, through Whom what was hidden from all eternity hath been manifested, if ye be of them that know. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.\" We make mention of thee and of them who have believed in this perspicuous Book, Which speaks in the Most Great Prison with a sovereignty that none in the heavens and earth can resist. God counsels you to show forth love, trustworthiness and unity, and commands you to that through which the essence of man may be made manifest in the contingent world. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who does what He wills and ordains what He pleases. Thus has the Most Exalted Pen raised its shrill voice. Blessed is he who has attained unto hearing it, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nBy the Sun of Truth! Any soul in whom the slightest capacity is found will surely be set ablaze by the fire of the Divine Word. The people are heedless, and this servant is bewildered and amazed. God willing, may all be illumined by the lights of God's Day and turn with heart and soul to the most exalted horizon. It is hoped that the divers in the ocean of truth will, with perfect wisdom, present the pearls of knowledge before the eyes of the world.\n\nA single spark from the Fire has struck all souls\n\nA hundred thousand Sinais have been kindled in hearts\n\nWhat cruelty has seized the hearts of the world that they remain deprived of this true spiritual warmth? What ailment has encompassed their vision that they are bereft of beholding these lights? Were this evanescent servant to present what he has been privileged to hear, the earth would appear transformed. How can this tongueless one move in the arena of utterance, and how can this sightless one be worthy to step into the realm of revelation and vision? In any case, holding fast to the cord of grace and clinging to the hem of bounty, the door of hope is, praise be to God, open. God willing, may all attain to what is befitting, and may the rays of the Sun of Justice dispel the darkness of the world. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nMention was made of Nasrullah Khan, upon him be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. Praise be to God, he has been and God willing will continue to be remembered before the Presence. Let him not be saddened by the dispersion of affairs. After separation, the light will shine forth in gathering. These matters were presented at the court of grandeur. Thus has spoken the Tongue of Revelation, exalted be His glory:\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! O thou who gazest upon My face and dwellest within the pavilions of My loving-kindness! Hearken unto My call from around My shrine. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Convey My glorification to him who was named Nasrullah in the Kingdom of Names, and give him glad tidings of what God, the Self-Subsisting, the Sovereign Protector, has ordained for him. Say: O my God and the God of the world, my Goal and the Goal of the nations! I beseech Thee by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will cause me to be, under all conditions, turned toward Thee, content with what descends from the heaven of Thy Command, and speaking Thy praise among Thy creatures. O Lord! Aid me in that by which my remembrance will endure in Thy Book. I know not what is with Thee, and Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Manifestation of Thy Self through Whom the horizon of the heaven of Thy Revelation was illumined, to ordain for me that which will profit me in the Hereafter and in this world. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nLikewise, two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were sent specifically to Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Taqi and his companion Shaykh 'Abdu'l-Husayn, upon them be the glory of God, that their eyes might be consoled. I beseech and hope for their confirmation from the True One, exalted be His glory. The ocean of bounty has not been and will never be fully reckoned, and the Sun of grace is not bound by any limits. However, those who can expound and remind are rare. God willing, through the endeavors of your honor and the friends of God, souls will be specifically appointed to serve the Cause, that they might guide all who dwell on earth to the path of God. This matter is most momentous. Blessed is he who attains.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about the honored lady of Ahl, upon her be the Glory of God, it was presented before His Presence, and a Tablet adorned with the ornament of the grace of the True One, glorified be His Glory, was revealed specifically for her. God willing, may she attain to the fragrances of the verses of the Manifestation of evident signs. Likewise, specifically for your honored sister, upon her be the Glory of God, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed. God willing, may she attain to the visitation of the Divine Tablet.\n\nAnd regarding the mention made of Aqa Siyyid Abu'l-Qasim from the people of ?, upon him be the Glory of God, the mention of the loved ones of the land of ? and the emigrants has ever been made in the Most Holy Court, and this servant testifies that the gaze of favor has been and is directed toward those souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of steadfastness. Nevertheless, their degrees of sincerity were presented in the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed for him from the Supreme Pen, His words, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed\n\nO Abu'l-Qasim! Thou hast heard what was inflicted upon the Twin Luminous Lights by the oppression of the ignorant ones of the earth who are known as divines. Now reflect upon what hath been inflicted upon this Wronged One. In the days when darkness had encompassed the world and the people of the Bayan were disturbed and concealed due to the might of the oppressors, this Wronged One arose alone to promote the Cause of God. To this bear witness the stars of My heaven and the sun of the horizon of My power, and most of the people of the earth have heard what was inflicted. Then when some measure of assurance was attained, the buzzing arose and the leaves of fire were spread by the hands of the wicked ones. Reflect upon Hadi of Dawlat-Abad. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that he was and is heedless of the root of the Cause, and moreover his understanding is observed to be less than that of an animal. Now he is occupied with clay like unto earthworms. Fie upon him and those who follow him! Say: O friends! Hold fast to the cord of patience. Soon the falsehood of those fabricated souls will become evident and manifest. Grieve thou not at anything. We have mentioned thee before and after. Convey My greetings to the friends of that land. They should appear with such power and might in the name of the True One that they would regard the world as non-existent and null, let alone the buzzing of flies. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then thank thy Lord, the Evident, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnd regarding the mention made of Aqa Mirza Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon him be the Glory of God, I beseech the True One, glorified be His Glory, that he may be assisted in transcribing the verses of God, and this is accounted as one of the great bounties. God willing, may he be assisted and confirmed in that which is the cause and means of permanence. His work that was sent previously was accepted with favor and is present with this ephemeral one. Today, which is the twenty-fifth of Jamadiyu'l-Avval, these exalted words were sent down from the heaven of grace, verses were revealed specifically for him, His words, glorified be His Glory: He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing \\[...\\]\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful from the heaven of grace to draw His servants nigh unto Him and to give them glad tidings of that which His Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for them. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. The conditions of the world cannot frustrate Him, nor can the clamor of the heedless prevent Him. He calleth out at all times with the most exalted call and guideth mankind unto the straight path of God. Blessed is the ear that hath not been debarred by the clamor of every denier, and the eye that hath not been veiled by the veils of the heedless. This is the Day which Muhammad, the Apostle of God, had formerly announced, and to which the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, have borne witness. Those who are intoxicated by the wine of vain imaginings have turned away from the Lord of all being and clung to their idle fancies and vain images.\n\nO Zein! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the Prison. He remembereth thee as a token of His grace and counseleth thee with that which shall exalt the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware lest the manifestations of the world prevent thee from the Lord of eternity. Preserve thy station through the Name of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Reflect upon that which hath appeared from God and ponder His signs. Thus doth command thee He from Whom is revealed a perspicuous Book. We have mentioned thee before and mention thee now from this glorious station. Be thou steadfast in serving the Cause and be vocal in praising God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus have We revealed the verses and sent them unto thee that thou mayest inhale from them the fragrance of thy Lord's loving-kindness and be of the thankful ones.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to him and to Aqa Mirza Abu'l-Qasim, upon them be the Glory of God, and declareth: Today is the day when all the friends of God must exert their utmost endeavor that perchance those who have strayed in the valley of self and passion might find their way to the most exalted homeland, and those who thirst in the desert of separation and remoteness might drink from the Salsabil of reunion. It is hoped that each soul may engage in teaching the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds with the utmost joy and fragrance. O Beloved of my heart! If souls of integrity would truly adorn themselves with that which hath been revealed in the divine Tablets concerning piety, righteousness, goodly character and praiseworthy deeds, and would hold fast to teaching the Cause, ere long the attraction of their sincerity and its effect would seize most souls. In such case, all would be observed free, liberated and at rest upon the thrones of glory and elevation. As commanded, one must hold fast to wisdom in all matters and not exceed moderation.\n\nConcerning the mention made of 'Ali-Akbar Big, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God, the glances of favor have been directed towards him. Detailed mention of him hath been made in the letter sent to the beloved Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be all the most glorious Glory. God willing, they will observe it and become informed. And now again, mention of him and of Mashhadi Haydar, upon them both be the Glory of God, whose names were at the end of your letter, was made before the Throne. The Sun of grace hath risen and shone upon each one. His exalted Word: We have witnessed their turning unto Us and have heard their call. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and He shall manifest unto them that which God hath ordained. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the minimum amount subject to Huquq, it was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply: \"This matter was revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas as the Bayan hath spoken, and later the minimum amount was fixed before the Face at nineteen units, a wisdom from Our presence.\" The purpose of this decree was the future enrichment of the general treasury, and perhaps its details will be submitted later. Up to this point, the answer to your letter dated the seventh of Dhi'l-Qa'dah was submitted one by one, and your other letter, beloved one, which was adorned with the mention and praise of the Beloved of the worlds and dated the twenty-seventh of Dhi'l-Hijjah, illumined and enlightened both heart and sight. And concerning what you wrote about your intention to present in every city the degrees of your servitude, humility and submissiveness, and that you beseech the All-Powerful Lord to enable you to serve the Cause - these matters were submitted before the Face. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the One Who standeth through His Name, the Self-Subsisting\n\nWe have aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of My verses, the Dayspring of My revelation and the Manifestation of My Cause, the All-Wise. We have caused thee to hear My call from the Mount of knowledge, and shown thee My luminous and radiant Beauty, and established thee in the service of My Cause as a bounty from My presence, for I am the Ancient Bestower. O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of My love! Hearken unto that which the idolaters say, who have taken for themselves a station behind the veil. When We manifest the Cause with power from Our presence, they emerge with the buzzing of flies and object to God, the Lord of all worlds. By God's life! The one whom the idolaters have taken as an idol for themselves apart from God is powerless to speak before the Face. To this testifieth every fair-minded and perceiving one. Thou didst stand firm in the Cause on a day wherein the limbs of the mighty and powerful trembled. Thou didst appear and manifest that whereof all things spoke. By God! The hidden and treasured mystery hath appeared through a command before which the hosts of earth and heaven cannot stand. Thus hath the Speaker of Sinai spoken from the Sinai of utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto the heedless. Convey My glorification to the faces of My loved ones, and give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My bounty and My mercy which have preceded all in the heavens and the earth. We have mentioned them time and again. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. Say: This is He of Whom the Point of the Bayan gave tidings, saying \"He is the One Who speaketh in every condition, 'Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of all worlds.'\" Say: This is a Day wherein the Bayan profiteth you not except through believing in that which hath been sent down regarding this Wise Remembrance. Leave what ye possess and take what ye have been commanded by God, the Strong, the Powerful. Thus hath the horizon of proof been illumined by the Sun of thy Lord, the All-Merciful's utterance. He is verily the Expositor, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have migrated in My path, endured hardships for My Name, and acted according to what they were commanded in My perspicuous Book.\n\nO handmaid of God and leaf of the divine Tree of Love! The Manifestation of Truth, glorified be His majesty, hath appeared so that all who dwell on earth might attain unto His recognition and drink from the Kawthar of His presence and reunion. All divine Books bear witness to this truth. Though all days are associated with God, in the Holy Scriptures this Day hath been specifically designated and become known as the Day of God. The chosen ones have ever beseeched the True One, exalted be His glory, for His presence, and God hath ever loved and continues to love meeting His loved ones. However, the conditions created by the heedless and the oppression of the wrongdoers have become an intervening barrier. That handmaid must be content in all conditions and be focused on and oriented towards the will of God, exalted be He. Thy aspiration is most lofty and thy request acceptable, but the Supreme Pen hath enjoined wisdom upon His servants and handmaidens. Therefore, attention to this direction is not advisable in these days. God willing, thou shalt be assisted to accomplish deeds that will cause the handmaids of God to be mindful. For any handmaid who attaineth unto this exalted and most sublime station, the reward of meeting Him hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. Recognize thou this most great favor and then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Generous. O 'Ali-Before-Akbar! Convey unto her that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will, and glorify her on My behalf, and give her the glad tidings of that which hath flowed from the chalice of My bounty. Speak with her on behalf of her Creator that which will gladden her eyes and rejoice her heart. The glory be upon thee and upon her and upon the handmaids of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nPraise be to God that they have been blessed with divine mention. The verses themselves testify to the favors of the True One, glorified be His majesty. Previously also, she had attained the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf, His sister - upon her be all the most glorious glory - and their love. Whenever a letter would arrive from them, they would mention her. The honored Mahbubi, son of the Most Truthful, upon them both be the glory of God, has also repeatedly mentioned her, and she has been blessed with the favors of the True One, glorified be His majesty. Should the veils of idle fancy be rent asunder and the station of a single mention flowing from the Supreme Pen be made manifest to the peoples of the world, then would the value of the favors, mentions and words of the Goal of all mankind become somewhat known and evident. Exalted is His bounty, glorified His grandeur, and lofty His favor. There is no God but Him.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the sale of property and the Huququ'llah, when this matter was submitted, He smiled and then these exalted words were revealed from the Dawning Place of utterance, the Lord of Names. His grandeur be glorified: \"Blessed is he, again blessed is he, for he hath desired to act according to what was commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" In truth, he and those like him have been and are worthy of this pure and accepted deed. We have accepted from him what he intended for God's sake, and We have forgiven him as a bounty from Our presence and a gift from Our court, for verily We are the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Helper, the Generous. How wonderful for you, that the Ancient Beauty was observed to smile at this matter. This was a great accomplishment that resulted from your honor's submission of intention, and furthermore that the intention was accepted and was then adorned with the forgiveness of God, exalted be His glory. The supreme bounty was that which was uttered from the tongue of grandeur in this station. God willing, may you ever be blessed with such bestowals. And in truth, this is that intention of which they had given tidings beforehand, saying \"The intention of the believer is better than his deed.\" This word claimed its station in this instance. This is from the bounty of our Lord, the Most Merciful. And in one instance They said: \"O servant present, write to the aforementioned one, upon him be My glory: The All-Bountiful sayeth: Through the bounty thou didst intend, thou hast attained, and art reckoned among those holy souls who have rendered the Huququ'llah. Be thou thankful and among those who give thanks.\"\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab Aqa Seyyed Abu-Talib, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - praise be to God they have been freed, although true freedom has been and will always be for those souls who are immersed in the ocean of divine love, and they, through the grace of the Beloved of the worlds, have attained and continue to attain this station. This servant repeatedly heard mention of them from the Divine Tongue. Once these blessed words were heard from the All-Merciful, exalted be His utterance: \"Verily he was imprisoned in the path of God and We found him patient in what befell him...\" And another time these supreme words were heard, He said: \"Abu-Talib has followed his Lord in prison.\" Also, a sublime Tablet was revealed especially for them from the heaven of grace some time ago which will be sent, God willing. At this moment while this evanescent one was occupied with writing, he was summoned to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. After attaining the presence, He said: Write to Abu-Talib, upon him be My Glory:\n\n\"O Abu-Talib! We have heard thy lamentations and thy cries have reached the ears of the Lord of Names. Give thanks to the Beloved of the world that He has aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Source of verses. Reflect on the tribulations that befell the Self of God, exalted be His glory. For nearly four months We were in the prison of Ta under chains and fetters. Repeatedly did We enter prison, yet with utmost joy and delight We continued to mention and utter the most excellent remembrances. After Our release We went into exile until this Most Great Prison became the seat of the Throne. Be thou joyful in what hath befallen thee, but in all conditions hold fast unto wisdom. Teaching is beloved only when a receptive place is found, otherwise it becomes the cause of mischief. Speak with wisdom, observe with wisdom, and act with wisdom. O Abu-Talib! We have mentioned thee before with that which nothing in all creation can equal, and We mention thee at this time as a token of grace from thy Lord, the Generous. And We make mention of thy father, to whom the All-Merciful hath testified in His perspicuous Book. He was among those who attained the presence of God when all on earth were prevented save whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, did will. He stood faithfully at the gate and acted according to what was commanded by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who remembereth him as revealed by the Supreme Pen of God, and blessed is he who hath loved him for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Abu-Talib! We counsel thee once again to hold fast unto the Most Great Wisdom. Cleave unto it and go not beyond its bounds. Verily thy Lord hath chosen wisdom and He is the All-Choosing, the All-Knowing. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy family and upon every assured and discerning one.\"\n\nThis evanescent one conveys greetings and salutations to them. God the All-Knowing bears witness that they have always been in mind, and the reason this perishable servant delayed in writing to them was out of wisdom. And concerning their question about their duties, this matter was presented before His presence. He said the Divine Cause must be concealed from those who are not worthy of it. The precious pearl before the blind, and the melodies of the nightingale before those deprived of hearing, have not and will never bear fruit. Therefore mention of the Cause before the government is not and has never been permitted. In all cases, the seeds of wisdom must be deposited in receptive soil. Verily He commands what is best for you if ye act accordingly.\n\nTherefore, mention of the Cause to the government is not and has never been permissible. In any case, the seeds of wisdom must be deposited in receptive soil. Verily, He commands what is best for you - act upon it and be among those who are firm.\n\nIt is submitted that certain mentions before the government or weak souls are not and have never been permissible, including mention of sending petitions to the Most Holy Court and receiving answers from the heaven of divine will, which is strictly forbidden before the authorities, as such mention may cause harm. The teaching work is contingent upon several conditions which all must observe, that it may cause acceptance rather than rejection, and extinguish the fire of corruption rather than ignite it. The beloved ones should convey these matters to some, that all may arise to do what is acceptable in God's sight.\n\nFor nearly thirty years, God, exalted be His glory, has forbidden all from engaging in corruption, contention and conflict. How many afflictions have befallen His loved ones, yet none has protested. Nevertheless, they have not yet desisted and are constantly engaged in oppression. The source of this oppression has been and will be the clergy. Despite the compassion, mercy, grace and favors of the Truth, the government has not yet grasped the main purpose. For if they knew God, glorified be He, to be truthful, they would surely testify that this Cause is sanctified from conflict, contention and corruption. The deeds of some in the past who were contaminated by selfish desires caused certain ones to doubt. If the government were to truly understand what is intended, they would surely arise to make amends for what has passed. But the effects of truthfulness must needs appear in the visible world, for its fragrance is evident and any possessor of smell can perceive it. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid the rulers in executing justice.\n\nIf they would adorn themselves with fairness and justice and turn to the Tablets, they would testify that this Cause has never been and is not opposed to government, but rather supports it in executing justice. O beloved of my heart! This servant is perplexed and knows not what to submit. Most of the servants have fallen into the sea of vain imaginings and are stupefied. In view of the trials of this servant, permission to reveal matters has not been and is not granted. Otherwise, by God besides Whom there is none other God, if they were to hear but one melody from the Bird of the Cause, all would utter the blessed words \"Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him shall we return.\" In truth, until now no one has truly uttered these blessed words, though all outwardly pronounce them, for this station requires absolute effacement of self, will and desire, and return to God, recognition of Him and arising for His sake.\n\nSome time ago this exalted word was heard from the mouth of the Will of the Lord of Names, exalted and glorified be His utterance: \"O servant in attendance! We have revealed two words about the meaning of 'There is no God but God.' It was observed that some of the mystics expressed inability to comprehend it. They are heard uttering this word night and day while remaining veiled from its meaning.\" God willing, may all on earth be adorned with the ornament of fairness and ascend to the kingdom of truthfulness.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Mihdi (upon him be the Glory of God - 669), son of the late and elevated Vazir (upon him be all My Most Glorious Glory), it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Threshold. This is what the Tongue of the Intended One spoke:\n\nIn His Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed\n\nO M.H.! We have mentioned thee before and guided thee to God's path and His Balance. He, verily, is the Expounding One, the All-Wise. We make mention of thee at this hour and counsel thee to remain steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of all beings, and We give thee glad tidings of His great favor. The whole world hath been created for the recognition of this wondrous and exalted Day, for the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Dayspring of Light, and He Who conversed on Sinai hath appeared and been made manifest. Today the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Far Boundary is raised high and the flow of the Kawthar of life is crystal clear, and every possessor of hearing doth hear it. God willing, thou shalt attain unto His special favors and become detached and free from the world and all who dwell therein. Today the call of the All-Merciful is raised, and likewise the shrieking of Satan. Those souls who today attribute themselves falsely to God have not been and are not aware of this Cause. They speak according to their desires and imagine themselves to be speaking the truth. Fie upon them and upon those who have denied God's signs, His proof, His evidence and His authority. Thou shouldst arise to serve the Cause with the utmost diligence and effort, to such extent that thou regardest the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings as non-existent and count them as nothing. O Mihdi! Be thou as an impenetrable barrier lest the Gog of self and Magog of passion transgress. Thus doth command thee He in Whose possession is the Perspicuous Book. God willing, mayest thou succeed in performing such deeds that thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nIn all conditions that honored one must be vigilant and engaged in protection, even as he hath been commanded to this great service both before and after. And concerning thy mention of the brethren (upon them be the Glory of God), after it was presented at the Most Holy Court, He manifested His favor, saying, exalted be His utterance: \"Verily they are under the glances of My favor and are mentioned in the Kingdom of My utterance. Upon them be My Glory, My mercy, My compassion and My favors.\"\n\nAnd concerning what was written about Jinab-i-Aqa Hasan-'Ali (upon him be the Glory of God), who is among thy kindred, after presentation these sublime words were revealed and made manifest from the Source of verses. He, exalted be His majesty, saith:\n\nIn My Name, the Wronged One, the Unique \\[...\\]\n\nO Hasan! The rebellious faction waited for years for the appearance of Husayn. After the Qa'im, thou didst witness what the abominable Shi'ihs inflicted upon that Kingdom of the Spirit. In the books of that faction this great announcement is recorded and inscribed, and they have said that after the Qa'im the appearance of Husayn would illumine the world and all the Prophets and Messengers, even the Qa'im, would gather under the banner of His Cause. Yet when the world was illumined by the lights of His Revelation, all were thunderstruck, bewildered and heedless. That souls who failed to recognize the Qa'im should deny is not strange; what is strange is that the deniers of the Bayan who claim to have recognized the Qa'im are seen to be veiled and heedless of this most great Revelation which is evident and manifest as the sun, nay, have risen in such denial as no eye hath seen nor ear heard the like thereof. Blessed art thou, O Hasan-i-'Ali, in that the Wronged One remembereth thee and commandeth thee to that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Glory be upon thee and upon all who are steadfast, firm and upright.\n\nThe request is that on behalf of this evanescent servant, greetings and salutations be conveyed to all the kindred. I beseech God that He may aid them all to do that which beseemeth this blessed Day.\n\nAs to thy mention at the end of thy letter concerning the handmaiden of God, the wife of Haji Mirza Hasan-i-Kirmani, upon them both be 669 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], what that beloved one wrote in this regard was presented before the Throne. This is what the Most Holy, Most Glorious, Most Exalted Tongue of our Lord spoke, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nIn My Name, the Warbler upon the Branches\n\nO My handmaiden, My handmaiden! Rejoice thou in that he who hath arisen to serve Me and who speaketh My praise hath mentioned thee, and there hath befallen him in My path that which caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament. O My leaf, O My leaf! The Divine Lote-Tree remembereth thee and calleth thee with that which hath enraptured the hearts of the Maids of Heaven in their chambers. O handmaiden of God! Today the queen of the world hath not attained unto that which thou hast attained. Thou didst hear the divine call and turn to the Most Exalted Horizon, and didst speak His praise on a day when the divines of the earth are heedless and veiled therefrom. Wert thou to voice praise and thanksgiving to the Peerless Beloved to the number of the sands and leaves, it would appear as naught compared to this supreme bounty and mighty favor. Well is it with thee for having quaffed the wine of My love, and happy art thou for having attained unto the favor of My Cause. God willing, thou shalt ever be aided to remain firm, steadfast and resolute. We make mention of all the handmaidens in that land, that all may, with utmost eagerness, longing, attraction and rapture, gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and voice the praise of the Divine Lote-Tree.\n\nO 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Upon thee be My Glory and My Loving-kindness! Convey that which thou hast been commanded, and remind My loved ones of that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My grace and the Heaven of My loving-kindness, and give them the glad-tidings of My turning towards them and My remembrance of them from this far-distant station.\n\nWhat else can this evanescent servant say? From the horizon of the revealed utterances, the dawning-place of verses, the effulgences of the Sun of grace, mercy and loving-kindness are of such magnitude that no one is left with the capacity to make mention thereof. Can any soul adequately render thanks for this? Nay, by Thy life! All the world standeth powerless and wanting. However, being enkindled with the fire of love in one's heart impelleth man to utterance and expression. In any case, despite my powerlessness and inadequacy, I beseech thee to convey greetings, mention and praise on behalf of this servant to that aforementioned leaf, upon her be the Glory of God. In truth, all that that Beloved One wrote concerning that leaf stirred up a warmth in the heart. I beseech the Exalted Truth to aid her and to raise up others like her in the earth. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy. Glory be upon you and upon those whom God hath related unto you and upon those who have rent asunder the veils and shattered the idols in the name of the Lord of all men and the Sovereign of all days.\n\nThis evanescent one submitteth that the penknife which thou didst write that Aqa Muhammad and Aqa 'Ali-A?ghar, upon them be the Glory of God, had given and requested be sent to the presence of the Branch of God - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - was received. May they, through God's grace and loving-kindness, exalted be His glory, attain and be illumined with the lights of divine love. Likewise, all that which the daughter of the one named Ismu'llah-i-A?daq and his cousin's daughter, upon them be the Glory of the All-Merciful, had sent specifically for the people of the pavilion of chastity and greatness was received, and one piece of expensive fabric about which details were previously written was received. May these leaves be aided in the divine days to such deeds as would cause their mention to become the cause of remembrance for all the women of the world. Verily, He is the Helper, the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThe Servant\n\n29 Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1299\n\n=== END BH00044 ===\n\n=== START BH00045 ===\n\nIn the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord\n\nThe Day is the Day of Return, and the Lord of all men is established upon the Throne of Utterance, calling unto the peoples of the world and summoning them unto that which shall preserve them, exalt them, and draw them nigh. Yet their ears, being tainted with the calumnies of the past and tales of old, are debarred from hearkening, and likewise their eyes, veiled by the shrouds of idle fancies, are deprived of witnessing. Glory be to God! This evanescent servant is at all times bewildered by how the peoples of the world and the various factions, despite having outward eyes and successive, continuous evidences before them, remain bereft and are observed to be deprived of God's infinite, descending favors - let alone those souls who are inwardly and outwardly deprived of the power of vision and are occupied with vain imaginings and idle fancies.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God and my Purpose! I beseech Thee by the Word which Thou hast made a light unto the Lamp, and a fire unto the misguided, and sweet water unto them that are nigh, and a torment unto the turned away, that Thou aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee, to draw nigh unto the court of Thy glory, and to cling to the cord of Thy bounty. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the all-encompassing nature of Thy verses and the manifestations of Thy clear tokens to send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy that which shall adorn them with the ornament of justice and fairness, that they may be fair in Thy Cause and in what hath appeared from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Choosing.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Thy sublime letters arrived successively, and each one was in truth, in the inner world, a petal from the petals of inner meanings, from which wafted the sweet fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. Therefore it brought joy - nay, it was the dawning-place of joy - and at every moment it increased happiness, delight, gladness and expansion. Glorified be God! Words that are recorded in the book of divine love possess another effect and another fragrance - they have no likeness and are sanctified from peer. However, there are many reasons for the delay in replying, therefore assuredly your honor and the other friends have not been and will not be saddened by the delay and postponement, for every minute of life has been and is being spent in one service or another. The Command is in the hand of God, our Lord, and He is witness to what I have said and say. Although through God's grace - glorified be His majesty - the delay has ended on this luminous night and an opportunity has arisen to respond to your sublime letter dated the 8th of the blessed Ramadan, and after its reading, observance, joy and gladness, intending the station of the Interlocutor of the Mount, in the presence of the Throne of the Lord of existence, achieving the honor of hearkening, His word, blessed and exalted be He:\n\nIn My Name, the One Who dominates over what was and what shall be \\[...\\]\n\nThis is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down unto him who hath believed in God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. O Ali! I bear witness that thou hast heard My call time and again, and hast acknowledged that which hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen in a preserved Tablet. Blessed art thou for having heard, responded, and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered from His exalted station. Thou hast attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain, and hast heard that which ears were prevented from hearing, save whom God, the Lord of the Frequented House, hath willed. Thou hast drunk the choice wine of utterance which hath flowed from the Pen of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, in His promised Day. Say: O concourse of the Furqan! Fear God, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and follow not every heedless and veiled one. That which was hidden from eternity hath been made manifest, and He Who was recorded by the Supreme Pen in God's Books, the Lord of existence, hath come. Say: O people of the Bayan! Open your eyes, for lo, the Tree is adorned with the fruits of wisdom and utterance before your faces, and the ocean surgeth with the waves of knowledge before your eyes. Fear God, and be not of those who have denied the favor after its revelation. He counseleth you as a token of His grace, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Then make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness which hath encompassed the dominion and the Kingdom. We have remembered every name that hath appeared before Our presence with a remembrance that no remembrance can equal. To this testifieth He Who in all things proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.\"\n\nO Ali! Hearken in the Persian tongue to the call of the Wronged One. In these days there hath come to pass that which hath no parallel from the beginning of time until now. We have been under the rule of enemies and, in the path of God, have been patient and thankful in times of hardship and tribulation. However, the grief of this Wronged One hath been and is from the deeds of some who claim to love Him. By God! From some there hath appeared that which hath burned the heart and consumed the liver, for the harm of their deeds hath reached the very Tree itself. In the days when We were imprisoned with chains and fetters in the land of Ta, every visitor and observer would behold joy and gladness in Our countenance, but now were anyone to look upon Us with the eye of justice and see Us, he would weep and lament for Our hardship and affliction. By the life of God! There hath befallen the Most Great News that which caused the Most Exalted Pen to weep and lament. Say:\n\nO my God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge and cause them to know that which will preserve them and draw them nigh unto Thee. May my soul be a sacrifice unto Thy sorrow, O Lord of all beings, and a ransom for Thy tribulation, O Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee, O King of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, by Thy signs whereby Thou hast guided the peoples to Thy Most Great Name, to enable Thy servants to do that which Thou lovest and approvest. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, and the Sovereign of the hereafter and the present world.\n\nIf any soul should reflect with justice and fairness upon that which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Divine favor, he would behold with his outward and inner eyes the greatness, sovereignty, grace and mercy of God, and would be moved to render thanks and praise. In the midst of sorrows inflicted and encompassing trials, We remain occupied with the mention of the loved ones of God. Glory be to God! Certain ones who claim to love Us, despite countless tokens of grace and manifestations of kindness and favor, have wrought that which no sage can reckon. The fire of greed and passion hath so seized their heedless hearts that they have transgressed the bounds of justice and fairness and have occupied themselves with oppression and calumny. The Servant beseecheth God - his Lord and your Lord - to adorn their temples with truthfulness and sincerity and with that which will exalt their stations in the world of creation. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Ye have heard, or will hear, the news of the great city. Since mention thereof hath been made before, it is now veiled. God willing, may He enable them to return and make them of those who have shown fairness in what hath been revealed. Verily, He is powerful over all things. As to their expression of perplexity and distress concerning certain matters, after these were submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these blessed words were revealed from the Supreme Pen, exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors:\n\nO Ali, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Thou and the Concourse on High bear witness that this Wronged One hath, through the Tablets sent down from the heaven of Will in the days and nights, commanded all according to their stations and ranks, and counseled them. Yet the enemies of God, exalted be His glory, have not forsaken the path of vain imaginings despite gracious counsel and blessed, goodly words. Rather, their heedlessness, rancor and hatred have increased. As for the loved ones, some have accepted and attained to that for which they were created from nothingness, while others claim love yet when their deeds and actions are examined, the words \"we seek refuge in God\" flow from the Tongue of Grandeur. By God's life! There hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen such counsels and admonitions that were they to be cast upon rock, it would turn to ruby, and were they to be showered upon a mountain, thou wouldst see it stirred by God's compelling Word. Yet in some souls they have had no effect. In certain Tablets words such as these have been revealed: This Wronged One's grief and tribulations have not been from enemies - for whatever befalleth in God's path is beloved and met with acceptance and gratitude - rather, His tribulations have been from those who claim to love Him. \"My harm cometh not from Mine enemies, but from those who claim to love God and follow Him yet commit that which causeth the people of the cities of justice and fairness to lament.\" I beseech God to assist all to turn repentantly unto Him. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Oft-Forgiving.\n\nThe education of souls dependeth upon reward and punishment. But now, as the Cause is veiled and the appointed One is not manifest, and likewise due to God's all-embracing mercy in these days becoming a cause of heedlessness and loss, blessed is he who casteth away desire and layeth hold of guidance. Today, humility, submissiveness, love, affection, unity and harmony are beloved and acceptable unto God. Blessed is he who holdeth fast to the fear of God and doeth what is right amongst His servants. He is of those who have helped God's Cause and attained what was ordained in His perspicuous Book.\n\nFrom the first dawning of the Sun of Utterance from the horizon of possibility until now, We have mentioned that which is the cause of comfort, glory and salvation. Yet those who act are as rare as red sulfur. Say: My God, my God! Sanctify the hearts of Thy loved ones from that which beseemeth not Thee and Thy days, and illumine them with the lights of Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion that the world and all therein may be enlightened thereby. O Lord! Make known to them that which harmeth and benefiteth them, that they may abandon what they have in hope of what Thou hast. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.\n\nA hundred thousand pities that man should remain heedless in these days and act in ways unseemly. The chosen ones of this Revelation - God's blessings and glory be upon them - must each be a teacher to the world, that perchance the heedless may, through their deeds and actions, find their way to God and attain His recognition. All are aware of the tribulations and afflictions that have befallen the Best Beloved of the worlds - may the spirit of all in the kingdoms of Revelation and creation be offered up for His sake - and have heard what hath transpired from the beginning until now. The chosen ones and pure ones must now cling to that which is befitting and which is a healing balm for inflicted wounds. The Servant beseecheth his Lord to aid all to render such service as shall cause faces to turn toward the Lord of existence.\n\nHere is verily the Day wherein secrets have been revealed and the Herald hath raised His Call from every direction! As to thy mention of turning in all directions for the sake of the Face of God and detachment from all else beside Him, after being presented before the Throne of His Purpose these resplendent words shone forth from the Dayspring of Divine Knowledge - exalted be His glory: \"O Ali, upon thee be My Glory! Well-spoken indeed were thy words, for detachment in itself is influential and attractive. In most Tablets mention of this station hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. It is the first ornament for drawing near and turning towards God, and the first deed for healing mankind of its ills and ailments. Blessed is the servant who hath clung unto it, for he is reckoned among the helpers in the Book of God, Lord of all worlds. Today the fear of God is as a lamp, and it is the first light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of detachment, and it is the greatest and most gracious robe for the temples of His servants. Blessed is the head adorned thereby and the temple that hath attained unto it. O Ali, by the life of God, if but one heart be sanctified and freed from worldly conditions, it can transform hearts through spiritual power and find its way to the heart of existence. It is hoped that thy movements and stillness, being for God's sake, may exert influence in the world and produce a mighty effect. He is verily the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nThou didst make mention of souls who have turned towards God. May they attain, God willing, to that which will cause the servants to turn to the Most Exalted Horizon. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to vouchsafe confirmation and assistance unto them. He is the Ocean of Generosity and the Heaven of Bounty. There is no God but Him, the Lord of all mankind.\n\nAmong those mentioned were Mulla Yahya and Aqa Mirza Yusuf and Mulla 'Abdu'llah, upon them be the Glory of God. After their names were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, these mighty verses were revealed - blessed and exalted be His utterance:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh the truth!\n\nO Yahya! The letter of him who hath loved Me hath come before the Wronged One, wherein was thy mention. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, that thou mayest arise with the power of thy Lord to serve His Cause and take hold of His Book with such strength that neither the oppression of any oppressor, nor the assault of any heedless one, nor the clamor of any ignorant one, nor the tyrants and pharaohs of the earth can deter thee. Thus hath the door of utterance been unlocked by the key of My Name, the All-Knowing, that the sweet-scented breezes of revelation might draw thee to God, Lord of all mankind. Recite the verses of thy Lord which We have sent down in the Holy Books and Tablets. They will guide thee to the Most Great Announcement and give thee to drink from the Kawthar of everlasting life from the hand of thy Lord's bounty, the Revealer of verses.\n\nAnd We make mention at this time of him who is named Yusuf and give him the glad-tidings of that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace from God, the Lord of Lords. Say: O people of the Furqan! Be fair in your judgment concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and follow not the sources of fancy and vain imaginings. Cast aside what ye possess, then hearken unto that which the Mother Book speaketh before the faces of the parties. This is the Day wherein secrets have been revealed and the Herald hath raised His Call from every direction\\[...\\]\n\nO Mulla 'Abdu'llah! The Light hath dawned from the horizon of Manifestation, inasmuch as He Who conversed with God hath been established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful. Say: O people! If ye deny God's Manifestation and His sovereignty and that which hath been sent down from His presence, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Fear ye God, and follow not every heedless doubter. Verily the ocean speaketh the truth, and the heaven proclaimeth, and the sun declareth: O concourse of the earth! By God, He hath come, He through Whose mention the Books of God, the Lord of all men, were adorned. He, verily, accepted tribulation for your salvation, and endured hardships for your comfort, and suffered the oppression of the oppressors that the light of justice might appear among mankind. Thus hath the luminary of bounty shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's mercy in the final return. The glory from God, the Lord of earth and heaven, be upon thee and upon them.\n\nAs to what was written concerning the blessed Book of Iqan, this year and last year it was again submitted to His presence as commanded, and hath been adorned with a new arrangement. God willing, a copy thereof will be sent so that the seekers and those who have turned unto God may transcribe from it. Although all that hath appeared from His presence is the truth in which there is no doubt, yet most of what was revealed was circulated to various regions in its first copy without review. O beloved of my heart! The verses have encompassed the world to such extent that no one is capable of gathering and enumerating them. Nevertheless, the opposers have uttered that which no oppressor hath ever uttered. The equivalent of the Books of the past and future now exists. The verses revealed and the evident proofs manifested in this Most Great Revelation and Momentous News are distinguished from all else, and the difference between them is as clear and evident as the sun. Blessed is the soul that turneth with justice and fairness and attaineth unto true witnessing and hearing.\n\nMy God, my God! Make not Thy servants deprived of the ocean of justice and the heaven of fairness. O my Lord! Aid them to turn unto Thee and enable them to return. Verily Thou art the Generous One, through the mention of Whose name the realities of all things have taken flight, and Thou art the Merciful One, Whose mercy hath preceded all who are in earth and heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the Kind, the Forgiving.\n\nIn the Name of Him Who manifesteth Himself above the earth and heaven!\n\nO 'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Thou hast attained unto My remembrance and My favor, before and after, by the sea and its waves, by the light and its effulgence, by the Lote-Tree and its fruits, and by the sun and its radiance. We have sent down upon thee from the heaven of grace and bounty that which every knowing and discerning one hath failed to reckon. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee at all times to serve His Cause amongst His servants, and to grant thee in every season the Kawthar of His knowledge from the cup of His bounty, that thou mayest draw men nigh unto His holy court and His glorious sanctuary. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nThou hast made mention of the days of Ridvan and of those who gathered in thy home and other homes to remember God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and the King of this wondrous Day. Blessed is the house that hath been honored with My favors, wherein My remembrance hath been raised, and which hath been graced by the presence of My loved ones who have spoken My praise, held fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness, and been blessed with the recitation of My verses. They are indeed honored servants whom God hath extolled in the Qayyumu'l-Asma' and in other Books. He, verily, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the One Who answereth prayer. We have indeed heard their mention and their praise in this Announcement by which the Concourse on High hath called out. By God! This is the Most Great Announcement which was mentioned in the Qur'an and before it in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. He, verily, thanketh His own Self on their behalf and maketh mention of Himself through their tongues. He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is he who standeth firm, whom the tempests of doubts raised by the transgressors have failed to move, and blessed is he who remaineth steadfast, whom the hosts of the oppressors and the might of the deniers, who have followed their idle fancies and denied Him in Whom they had believed, have failed to shake. They are indeed among the most lost in My perspicuous Book.\n\n\\[Note: The first paragraph of the original text appears to be an introduction to a Tablet and discusses the days of Ridvan, but since it's not part of the actual Tablet, I've provided only the translation of the revealed words (the Tablet itself) which begins with \"In the Name of Him...\"\\]\n\nO Ali! Remember My loved ones who came before thee, and convey unto them My remembrance, My praise and My glorification, that the fragrance of thy Lord's loving-kindness may stir them and draw them unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. And remember My handmaidens and My leaves who have clung to My Tree and held fast to the hem of My luminous robe. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon them, both men and women, from God, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nSay: O people of the world! Whither is fairness fled? What hath become of justice? Have sight and hearing vanished from the people of learning and wisdom, or have they become non-existent? If they still exist, why have ye debarred and deprived yourselves from the most exalted station, the highest rank, and the most sublime abode? Each day the divine verses descend like torrential rain, and each night a Book appeareth from the Mother Book. If ye claim not belief, it matters not and never did. Despite your attachment to former proofs and latter evidences, and your clinging to God's verses and His infinite Manifestations, why have ye turned away and denied the proof before which all proofs bow down, and the evidence before which all evidences are humbled?\n\nO concourse of divines! Ye sit upon the seat of glory in His name and have become leaders of the people through His mention, yet ye remain heedless of and turn away from Him. How long will ye remain dead upon the couch of heedlessness and cling to the cord of denial? This is the Day of recognition and the Day of turning unto God. Cast aside your vain imaginings and suspicions, and with sanctified and detached hearts turn your faces toward God. By the life of your Beloved and mine! This is spoken for the sake of God and offered purely out of love. Present yourselves and each day seek a Book, that ye may discover what your imaginings have withheld from you, and behold what your eyes have turned away from, and hear what your ears have been heedless of.\n\nIf this Ocean and its waves be denied, and this Sun and its rays be concealed, to what will ye hold fast and what proof and evidence will ye cling? By the life of my Lord and your Lord! None hath any refuge, shelter, escape, protection or sanctuary except through this Cause which hath dawned from the horizon of the will of our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nO Beloved of my heart! Although the recompense of their rejected deeds hath deprived them and kept them from the Dayspring of divine revelation, yet, in view of our Lord's grace, we beseech for them return unto Him and repentance at His door. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nMention hath been made of the divine eulogists whom God hath aided to praise and extol Him, enabled to spread His signs, and through whom He hath gladdened the hearts of His near ones and expanded the breasts of the sincere among His servants. All have attained unto that which truly no heavens and earth can equal. Although mention of his honor Shukuhi, upon whom be the glory of God, was made in the letter of his honor Ibn-i-Ismullah-i-Asdaq, upon both of whom be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, yet renewed mention of them and other loved ones, upon whom be the glory of God, hath been revealed from the Pen of our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof, and there is no God but Him - He is the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nO Shukuhi! Upon thee be My glory! Thy mention and thy name have repeatedly been referred to in the Most Holy Court, and thou hast been favoured with the waves of the Ocean of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds. We have remembered thee time and again with a remembrance which, when revealed from the Mouth of the Divine Will, caused the Kingdom of utterance to proclaim: \"By God! He Who created Me with a Word from His presence hath come, and hath manifested Me to announce unto men His appearance, His revelation, His might, His power, and the evidences of His Pen which have encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen.\" O people of the earth! Fear ye God, and follow not every heedless and dubious learned one. Abandon the world and all that is therein, then turn unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Blessed art thou, O Shukuhi, for having adorned thy tongue with praise of thy Lord, Who was denied by every oppressor, detested by every idolator, and condemned by every transgressing sinner. When thou hearest the call from the Supreme Horizon, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, for having aided me to turn unto Thee when most of Thy creation turned away from Thee, and enabled me to praise and describe Thee when most of Thy servants denied these. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who hast illumined the horizons through Thy manifestation on the Day of Separation, to inspire me in all conditions with that which will attract the hearts of the world. O my Lord! Thou seest me acknowledging Thee and Thy signs and whatsoever hath appeared from Thee, confessing the transcendence of Thy Being above all else and the sanctity of Thine Essence above the descriptions of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee not to deprive me from the heaven of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Haji Mirza 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, saith:\n\nHe is the One Who ruleth over all names!\n\nA Book from Our presence unto him who was named 'Ali before Akbar, that it may draw him unto the Scene of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. My Most Exalted Pen hath not hesitated in that which it was commanded. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. We have heard what thou didst compose in praise of thy Lord and what thou didst recite among the concourse of the near ones. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make thee steadfast in His love and a helper to His Cause through remembrance and utterance. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O people of the earth! The Spirit speaketh in the breast of the world, and the Light hath shone forth from the horizon of Sinai, for its Speaker hath seated Himself upon the throne with manifest sovereignty. Say: Beware lest vain imaginings prevent you from the Luminary of certitude, and beware lest the doubts of every ignorant and rejected one veil you. This is the Day wherein the world hath been adorned with the Most Great Name, and the Ocean of utterance hath spoken before all faces. Say: O concourse of divines! Set aside your learning. The gate of God's knowledge, the Lord of the past and future, hath been opened. That which is with the people will not profit you today. Take ye what ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of the Promised Day. Thus hath crowed the Cock of the Throne, and the Nightingale of eternity hath warbled upon the highest branches: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Sovereign of the Realm of Might.\" The glory from Us be upon him whom the attraction of the verses found and whom He adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and aided in that which befitteth this irrevocable Announcement.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Mirza 'Abdu'l-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, which shineth forth from the horizon of might \\[...\\]\n\nGod beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who speaketh is the One promised in the Book of God, the Lord of Hosts. He hath come from the heaven of divine knowledge with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Blessed are they who recognize! The earth and heaven have been illumined by the light of Baha, yet most people perceive it not. They have cast away God's Cause and taken their own idle fancies - verily they understand not. We have heard thy mention in this Most Great Remembrance and thy praise in this manifest Announcement. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to speak Thy praise amongst Thy loved ones and for having made known to me Thy path, unto which, when it appeared, all the paths of the world hastened, yearning to be connected with it through their relation to Thy Beloved Name. O Lord! Aid my tongue to remember and praise Thee, mine eyes to witness Thy signs, and my heart to turn unto Thee, O Beloved of hearts! Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the One Who commandeth justice and ruleth over what was and what shall be.\n\nThis was revealed for his honor Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\].\n\nHe is the Ancient Revealer!\n\nGlory be to God! This Day hath a different air, and this Ocean different waves, for it is designated and known as the Day of God. This is that Day whereof Moses was given glad tidings, and concerning whose proclamation and spread the Spirit (Christ), may the souls of all else be His sacrifice, was commanded. Say: O people of the Bayan, the Most Exalted Point hath spoken saying \"I am the first of them that worship Him,\" and the Holy Spirit proclaimeth \"The Comforter hath come.\" Beware lest the Remembrance prevent you from the One Remembered, or the exposition from its Revealer, or the Book from its Sender. The Mother Book hath been revealed from the All-Bountiful in His final abode. Fear ye God, O peoples of the parties! Turn unto God, the Single, the One, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThy call hath been heard. The ears have heard what thou hast sung in praise and remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: My God, my God! Aid me in all conditions to speak Thy praise amongst Thy servants and to recite what Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy knowledge and bounty. O Lord! Thou seest the unlearned seeking the ocean of Thy wisdom, the ephemeral the river of Thy eternity, and the dead the stream of life from the hand of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which will assist me and be with me in my life and death and in all Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Most Generous.\n\nThe End\n\nIn truth, these tongues which in these days are engaged in the praise of God have appeared from the Kingdom of utterance and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the tongues of those servants who belong to the physical realm. In one station they are without peer or likeness, without equal or comparison. Every praise that is manifested today from any praising soul is as a spirit for the awakening of others, whether it be in verse or prose. Glorified be their Strengthener, their Creator, their Inspirer, their Sustainer, their Helper and their Succorer! Glory be unto God! The world of utterance is bewildered by those who know not. Mention and praise, bounty and bestowal have reached such a station that the understanding of the mature minds falls short of comprehending it. Again, glory be unto God! The mountain is rent asunder by the Word of God in its longing to attain His presence, and the Tree of Sinai, upon merely hearing His call, has split the earth and, with its branches, twigs, leaves and fruits, has made for the highest horizon. Blessed is the ear that heareth and the eye that seeth! Where are these eyes and where the witnessing of these lights? Where are these ears and where the hearing of the call of the Lord of all beings? Today the Cup-Bearer is the Self of Truth, glorified be His majesty. He giveth the cup of reunion and bestoweth the chalice of meeting. Now is the time, now is the time! Blessed, a hundred thousand times blessed, are they who have removed the veil and have, on the wings of longing and yearning, sought the most glorious horizon. The grace, the bounty and the favor of God be upon His loved ones and His chosen ones who have testified to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Praise be to God! Each of the pages sent is adorned with the mention of His loved ones. Although today, due to the lack of vision and hearing, the station of the assured, devoted and tranquil souls is not known, yet God hath prescribed for Himself that days shall appear wherein their traces, their remembrances, their names and that which hath proceeded from their tongues shall be spread abroad, despite the divines of Iran and their jurisprudents who have oppressed on earth and have committed that whereby God's favor hath been changed amongst them. They are indeed among the people of error. Among the loved ones whose names have flowed from that honored one's truthful pen and have attained the hearing of the Lord of Utterance and its Revealer were he who was named after the Desired One and his brother, Sheikh Qasim, upon them both be the glory of God. The rain of grace and favor hath showered upon them, and specifically for each one a most wondrous, most mighty, most holy Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will. They are mentioned both in this letter and recorded on a separate page, that each soul may possess the bounty of its Lord as a favor from His presence. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. This is what hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty. His word, blessed and exalted is He: He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Shaykh! Blessed art thou, and blessed is thy name, and blessed is he who hath hearkened to thy words in praise of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. We were with thee and heard thy mention in this Remembrance, which, when it shone forth from the horizon of grace, the Books of the world bowed down before it, and the limbs of the nations trembled, save those who cast away transgression and wickedness, clinging fast to righteousness and the fear of God. Verily thy Lord heareth the call of His loved ones and whatsoever proceedeth from their mouths in proclaiming His irrevocable and binding Cause. Nothing escapeth thy Lord's knowledge. He heareth and seeth, though most of the people perceive not. Say: Fear God, O people! Do they not behold the waves of the ocean of His verses? Do they not witness the effulgent rays of the Sun of His praise? Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which ye are commanded by God, the Lord of the cities of wisdom and knowledge. Say: This is the Day whereon that which was hidden, which lay stored in knowledge and was inscribed by the Pen of Command upon a Tablet that was sealed with the seal of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, hath been made manifest. Beware lest the veils of the people prevent you or the might of any oppressor rejected cause you to fear. Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord with such steadfastness as shall illumine hearts and minds. Thus hath the call and rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing been raised. Well is it with the people who understand. We have mentioned thee time and again, and have revealed unto thee that which causeth the mountains to move, by the command of Him Who is the Lord of existence. Glory be upon thee and upon them that follow thee in this promised Announcement.\n\nThis was revealed from the heaven of grace for him who was named Shaykh Qasim, upon him be the glory of God, exalted and sanctified be His words:\n\nBy My Name through which the trumpet was sounded!\n\nO Qasim! Great is this Day and great is this Cause, yet most of the people of the earth are like children playing with the clay of idle fancies, heedless of the light of these days. The Tongue of Grandeur counseleth all to observe justice and fairness. Read what hath been revealed in this Most Great Revelation and what was revealed aforetime, then judge with equity and be not of the oppressors. Today the Book of God itself speaketh, and from the hand of bounty the Kawthar of eternity is bestowed. Take ye and drink, and be not of the heedless ones. The Sun of Truth is seen with a light transcending all lights, and the Mount is beheld with a joy surpassing all joy and gladness, for it hath attained unto the presence of its Beloved. The rapture and ecstasy of Him Who conversed with it hath so seized it that every atom of its being proclaimeth: \"The Lord is come and the Kingdom is His!\" Say: O people, deny not yourselves and deprive not yourselves. Hearken unto the divine call which is raised in all times from the direction of the Prison. It is the cause of the preservation of the world and the joy and expansion of nations. It is the cause of life, and through it the dead are adorned with the eternal robe of life. Strive that perchance ye may turn from oppression to justice and from tyranny to fairness. O Qasim! Praise be to God, glorified be His majesty, Who hath mentioned thee and continueth to mention thee through verses which are the cause of the manifestation of the Most Great Grace and the Greatest Bounty. Praise be to God! Time and again hath the heavenly food of knowledge and understanding descended like torrential rain from the heaven of bounty. Whosoever hath partaken thereof hath attained unto all good. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this exalted and glorious station. Glory be upon thee and upon them that hearken unto thy words in this Most Great Remembrance and this perspicuous Cause.\n\nIn the Name of My All-Apparent One, Who speaks throughout all regions!\n\nO Hussein, upon thee be My Glory! This Wronged One hath, from the earliest days until now, openly and without any veil or concealment, revealed the mysteries of the Day of Return, and counseled all with that which would exalt them and draw them nigh. Yet the people, heedless, have turned away from the Luminary of certitude and turned unto their vain imaginings. Each faction among the factions of the earth hath clung to its own way, remaining deprived of the immortal countenance and the inexhaustible waters of the true Kawthar. The bounty of utterance descendeth at every moment, and the feast of knowledge is spread before all faces, yet the recompense of the deeds of the servants hath prevented them from the outpourings of the Day of Reckoning. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Aid those who have been heedless of Thy remembrance and praise in Thy days, then enable them to shatter the idols of their desires. O Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation, and are in the grasp of Thy power. Withhold them not from the ocean of Thy bounty and the lights of the Luminary of Thy grace. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the light of the Manifestation which shone forth from the Sinai of appearance, that Thou write down for me and for those who have believed in Thee and Thy verses that which Thou hast ordained for those who have cast away the world in their longing to meet Thee. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for the other Hussein, upon him be the Glory of God. His word--exalted be His verses and mighty His utterance:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Answerer!\n\nSay: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance and for having sent down for me and for my outer and inner being that which shall endure throughout the duration of Thy dominion and Thy kingdom. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned with my whole being unto Thee, detached from the manifestations of self and passion and the daysprings of wickedness and indecency. O Lord! Thou seest me attracted by Thy verses, seeking the encounter of Thy tablet and Thy traces, and certain of, acknowledging, confessing, and submitting to Thy Manifestation and what hath appeared from Thee and what Thou hast sent down in Thy Books. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy generosity, beseeching the wonders of Thy grace and hoping for Thy mercy which hath preceded all who are in Thy earth and Thy heaven. I beseech Thee to ordain for me by the Pen of Thy Command that which befitteth Thy loftiness and transcendence and Thy greatness and power and Thy generosity and bounty. Then assist me in Thy service and the service of Thy loved ones. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is no God but Thee, the Speaker on Sinai, Who is established upon the throne of manifestation.\n\nPraise be to God that the Euphrates of mercy, flowing from the Most Exalted Pen, has bestowed eternal spirit. Each of His mentioned loved ones, upon them be the glory of God, has attained that which is the cause of the world's advancement and the means of guidance for all peoples. From the horizon of each Tablet shines forth the Orb of grace, illuminating and brightening the world of justice and equity. The Peerless Wise One has, through His consummate wisdom, shown each one a clear and manifest path through the waves of His Revelation. We hope that they may attain unto the new life through the Kawthar of bounty and arise to serve His Cause. Today the hosts of revelation are victorious and the ranks of inspiration triumphant. In truth, were but a single verse from the Tablet to be cast upon the manifestations of justice and equity, all would voice the blessed words \"I have turned my face toward Him Who hath created the heavens and the earth.\" The present creation cannot adequately render thanks for this mercy and bounty of God. Blessed are those souls who, detached from all else, have set their faces toward the Most Exalted Station and have arisen to aid the Cause of God through praise, good deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Blessed is God Who hath raised them up through His Most Exalted Word, whereby they have cast aside all else and have clung to His most holy, most pure, most luminous and resplendent hem.\n\nAs to what was written concerning Aqa Siyyid Javad, who was enkindled with the fire of the love of God: a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed in the hand of the Most Glorious specifically for him, from which the sun of the mention of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, shone forth from the horizon of inner meanings. May it be well with him and may he find pleasure therein.\n\nConcerning what was written in another letter about how, during the sacred and blessed days and nights of Ridvan, the loved ones--upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful--made every effort and each, according to his capacity, arose to serve: these matters were presented before the Seat of Grace, were heard, and these manifest verses were revealed from the Dawning-Place of utterance. He--exalted be His glory and universal His bounty--says:\n\nO 'Ali! Upon thee be My mercy and My loving-kindness. Each of the souls mentioned who were present during the days and nights of the Most Great Festival--whether those who attained the honor of hearing or those who arose to serve, as well as those who composed and recited verses in praise and glorification of the Goal of all the worlds--all have attained unto the previously-bestowed mercy, the all-encompassing loving-kindness, and the all-embracing gifts. No deed is ever lost in the sight of God, nor shall it ever be. It is a treasure preserved for its owner with the Trusted One, and its traces and fruits appear according to the requirements of consummate wisdom and the appropriate time and day. Blessed are they and blessed is he who loved them and was present among them. Indeed, each one has repeatedly been mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur. We beseech God that all may at every moment succeed in performing such deeds and actions as will cause the spread of the Word of God and His signs. Blessed is he who hath adorned his head with the crown of trustworthiness and his temple with the ornament of righteousness. He is, by the Pen of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, of the people of Baha.\n\nO children of the Friend \\[Abraham\\] and heirs of He Who conversed with God \\[Moses\\]! I truly say, today you are adorned with the ornament of the Most Glorious Name and are related to the Truth. By My life! We see the Friend in such joy that the Pen of Creation is powerless to describe it, and He Who conversed with God We behold in delight that exceeds all reckoning. Take the chalice of immortality in the name of your Lord, the Lord of all humanity, then drink therefrom in spite of every heedless and remote one, every obstinate oppressor, every sinful learned one, every base mystic, and the son of the wolf whose wickedness has eclipsed the wickedness of the ancients. They have ever been and continue to be illumined by the effulgent lights of God's remembrance. The honored one, upon him be My glory, hath mentioned you in the Most Holy Court and hath sought from the ocean of divine verses that which is sanctified from doubt and likeness. His petitions have repeatedly arrived. Praise be to God, he hath partaken of the Kawthar of utterance. He hath departed from his abode, turning towards My horizon, traversing paths until he stood before the Gate which was opened unto the faces of all who are in the heavens and the earth. He heard His most sweet call and His most exalted remembrance. He is verily the Helper, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed art thou, O Abu'l-Hasan! God hath aided thee to turn towards His horizon, to face the lights of His countenance, and to hold fast unto that which thou hast been commanded in His Book. We beseech Him to grant thee a goodly reward from His presence. He is verily the Ocean of Generosity unto all in the world and the Heaven of Bounty unto all who are adorned with the ornament of existence. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nEvery letter that hath flowed from the Pen of the Lord of all beings indicateth supreme benevolence and greatest mercy. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make the mentioned loved ones inebriated at all times with the wine of knowledge and to grant them success in guiding people, that they may give to those who are ready to receive that which they have drunk from the Most Great Ocean. This is the station of supreme endeavor, not the giving of gold and silver. I convey greetings and praise to each one. God is My witness that in every night and day I have besought in His presence for each one that which is the cause of the life of the world. Verily our Lord is powerful over all things.\n\nThe deputyship of that beloved one, which is the king of deeds and foremost of actions, became manifest as infinite grace and confirmed it. This servant succeeded in fulfilling it, and that beloved one's portion was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. In one moment, two bounties were bestowed. Who is capable of offering befitting thanks or praising Him as beseemeth His sovereignty and greatness? In brief, the pilgrimage was performed on behalf of that beloved one, as was the circumambulation, and this was among the unexpected bounties, for first the Ancient Beauty was seated upon the throne, and after permission and leave for visitation was granted, they arose. The visitation was performed, and likewise, when They were walking, once the circumambulation was achieved. Blessed and welcome news for your honor and for the people of God, blessed and exalted is He. Praise be to God! The tears and sighs of that beloved one at the time of writing in that land had their effect in the Land of the Desired One. The servant beareth witness that nothing appeareth except that it hath within it an effect and fruit which God shall manifest at some time and in some moment.\n\nIn My Name, the Hearer, the Answerer\n\nO Muhammad-Husayn! Blessed art thou for having turned towards God on a day when most men have turned away. Praise be to God that the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory, hath confirmed thee, destiny hath aided thee, and His name, strengthened by His hosts, hath preserved thee, until thou hast attained unto this station in these days. Blessed art thou, and blessed is thy father, and blessed are those associated with you both whom God hath linked to you. Excellence is in what thou hast practiced and pursued outwardly, for We have enjoined upon all to engage in crafts and professions, which We have accounted as acts of worship. However, at the outset thou must don the robe of trustworthiness from the hands of divine bestowal, which is the station of acceptance, for this is the first gateway to bounty and blessing. We beseech Him to make these words as an illumined cloud that shall rain upon thee the showers of mercy, grace and blessing. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nPraise be to God that thou art blessed with His grace and adorned with the pearls, both hidden and manifest, of the Supreme Pen. The world hath not equaled, nor shall it ever equal, these sublime words now descending from the heaven of divine Will. Rejoice and say: \"Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds, and glorified art Thou, O Desire of them that have recognized Thee. Thou knowest and seest how this servant of Thine hath desired to serve Thy Cause and to exalt Thy word amongst Thy servants. Aid him through Thy power, Thy might and Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Forgiving, the Generous.\"\n\nO 'Ali! My Baha be upon thee. Convey to the loved ones in that land the greetings of the Wronged One. Give them My salutations and gladden them with what hath been sent down from the heaven of His bounty, that all may be drawn, with heart and soul, to the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Horizon through the living waters of mention and utterance. Proclaim unto them such a proclamation as would cause the Tree of Sinai to speak within their breasts and their very beings to be set ablaze with its fire, and give them such glad-tidings as would move them to aid their Lord with their tongues, their eyes, their hands and their hearts. Verily thy Lord is the Transformer of hearts. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Manifest, the Sovereign, the All-Wise.\n\nO my beloved! Love for that honored one hath caused much to be written. I beseech God at all times to set those regions ablaze and illuminate them through thy endeavors. The beloved of my heart, Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the glory and favor of God, brought thy letter into the presence where it attained the honor of being heard. Praise be to God, every day hath been and continues to be a day of thy remembrance. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful, and He is the Kind, the Generous. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you, your family, both women and men. Authority and might belong to God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection.\n\n=== END BH00045 ===\n\n=== START BH00046 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nO beloved of my heart! Where is the one who heareth and where is the one who seeth? The verses speak, the clear signs give utterance, the sun beareth witness, and the moon and stars testify; yet the powers of sight and hearing are weak. The blessed Tablet which was revealed specifically for his honour 'Ali-Qabli-Muhammad, son of His Holiness the Most Truthful Name of God, upon both of whom be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, was adorned with these sublime words - thus saith the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: \"O son of My Name! Were the entire spiritual realm to be transformed into the power of hearing, one could say it would be worthy of hearkening to these utterances that have flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful. Otherwise, the visible ears have not been and will never be capable of hearing this call, save for a numbered few. Beseech God to grant thee insight and bestow upon thee the power of hearing, that perchance His helpless servants may not remain deprived of the sweet fragrances of this divine Day.\"\n\nToday the horizons of the heavens of the unseen and the seen are illumined with the lights of the Day-Star of utterance, yet an eye capable of beholding is rarer than the red elixir. The recompense of deeds hath prevented most of the people of the world from drawing nigh and deprived them of the outpourings of the days of the All-Bountiful Lord. Throughout ages and centuries the peoples of the world have awaited the days of His manifestation and still do - the followers of Moses in temples, the followers of the Spirit in churches, and the followers of the Criterion in mosques, all beseeching and hoping to attain His presence in the days of His appearance and not to be deprived of the ocean of His utterance. Yet when the lights of the manifestation of the Desired One of all worlds shone forth from the horizon of will, all remained heedless and veiled save whom God willing. The Christian says the Spirit must appear from heaven in great glory; that people remain heedless and deprived through such vain imaginings. And the Shi'ih sect says the Qa'im must come and appear from the imaginary Jabulqa and the fictitious Jabulsa. I testify that all sects worship their own desires and are devoted to the idols of their fancy. They follow heedless and ignorant souls and cling to their vain imaginings, while turning away from the light of the Sun of Manifestation. Such is the condition of the people of the world.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Lord of the nations and Master of eternity! I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which the ocean of knowledge surged in creation and the Day-Star of utterance shone forth from the horizon of proof, to aid the people of Thy earth to turn toward the court of Thy nearness and to attain presence before Thy countenance. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy mercy not to withhold Thy servants from the outpourings of Thy days. Draw them nigh, O my God, through Thy power, teach them the ways of Thy guidance, and make them know the manifestations of Thy greatness and the evidences of Thy might. Then ordain for them that which will keep them from all else save Thee and will guide them to Thy Mighty Announcement, whereby the limbs of all names trembled and the hearts of all in the kingdom of creation were convulsed. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of earth and heaven. Moreover, I beseech Thee, O my God, my Master and my Support, by the station which was honored by Thy footsteps and by the verses which descended from the heaven of Thy grace, to assist whosoever hath turned toward Thee and desired of the wonders of Thy bounty, and to ordain for him what Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee, who have arisen to aid Thy Cause. Then write down for him the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd furthermore, O beloved of my heart! Your letters, like abundant rain, have arrived in succession. Their effect was as the spring breeze of inner meaning, and their fruit as the produce of the garden of utterance and significance, for every letter thereof was a truthful testimony and an eloquent witness to your acceptance, attention and steadfastness in the Cause of God, exalted be His glory. Each instance was a cause of joy and a source of delight, and the presence of each one spoke of the station of nearness and attainment. Blessed be your pen and joyous be your ink! After their observation, reading and review, they ascended to the supreme heights and most exalted horizon. In the presence of the Countenance of the Purpose of all worlds, they attained the honor of being heard, and in each instance the ocean of the utterance of the Most Merciful surged in such wise that the minds of the world were incapable and powerless to reckon it. And on this occasion, after being presented before Him, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses - thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He: \"In My Name, through which the suns of manifestation have dawned from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge!\"\n\nO Ali! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. By God, through it the ocean of divine knowledge surged in creation, and the Luminary of proof shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of certitude, and the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the highest branches, \"There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nWe have seen what thou didst send before and after, and We heard thy call therefrom. We answered thee with that wherewith the Lote-Tree of the Ultimate Boundary was adorned with the leaves of wisdom and utterance, but the people are in a strange sleep. We have seen thy devotion and have turned unto thee, and have brought forth from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen the pearls of favor and grace that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nGive glad tidings to My loved ones with My remembrance and remind them of what hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing. Say: Beware lest the tyranny of any oppressor, or the turning away of any rejecter, or the might of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, hold you back.\n\nSay: Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye deprive yourselves of the Living Waters which flow from the Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds. Cast aside vain imaginings, then hasten with your hearts to the Most Great Ocean and drink therefrom in My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: By God, were the Point of the Bayan to circle round the Throne of the All-Merciful before your faces - fear God and deny not the Truth through your idle fancies. Verily He hath come from the horizon of power with manifest sovereignty. We have raised Him up in truth and sent Him to give glad tidings unto men of this Most Great Cause and this Mighty News.\n\nSay: Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and be not of them who denied God's proof after its revelation and disputed His signs after their manifestation. He counseleth you out of His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.\n\nO Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. This is that call for the hearing of which the world was created. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God in that land and its surroundings. The mention of each of those who have turned unto God hath ever flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur, that perchance they may attain such a station through the light of the Word and the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree that the seas of the doubts of the polytheists, atheists and traducers may not quench it nor stay its burning.\n\nHow many widespread dominions hath the hand of destiny rolled up and cast away, consigning both kings and subjects to the dust! What morning hath no evening to follow it, and what life hath not death pursuing it? Soon shall that which is visible be seized by the might of annihilation and return to non-existence. Say: O friends! These are days for which the Prophets, the Chosen Ones, and the Messengers sought audience with God, exalted be His glory. Each of you, through God's grace, hath attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. Know ye the value of this station and illumine the horizons with the light of unity. One mention in this Day excelleth the remembrances of centuries, and one deed in these days surpasseth the deeds of ages. Strive ye that perchance ye may achieve a deed which shall be adorned with the crown of acceptance and shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth.\n\nIn these days the thief entereth in the guise of the trustworthy, and the manifestations of tyranny appear in the name of justice. We have formerly informed all of that which would later appear. O people of God! Give not credence to every speaker, and be on your guard against the claimants. This is the binding command of the Most Exalted Pen which hath been manifested in the prison. The Glory which is manifest, evident, radiant, and shining from the horizon of My utterance be upon thee.\n\nBe on your guard against the pretenders - this is the imperative command of the Most Exalted Pen that hath been revealed in prison. The Glory that is manifest, evident, radiant and shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon My party, whom neither the might of the aggressors, nor the riches of the heedless, nor the doubts of the suspicious, nor the croakings of the detractors have deterred from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nAt this moment We make mention of My handmaidens. By God's life, all are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One and have attained unto divine bounty. We give them all the glad-tidings of God's mercy and remind them through resplendent verses. For each one We beseech that which hath flowed from the Pen of the Lord of all beings and hath been recorded in the Crimson Scroll. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nPraise be unto our Lord, our Goal and our Beloved, Who hath manifested such grace as pens are powerless to recount, such mercy as tongues fail to describe, and such loving-kindness as souls fall short of comprehending. This evanescent servant, with utmost humility and supplication, beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid His loved ones in that which is befitting of His days and worthy of His grace. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nThey who doubt this most manifest Cause and turn away from Me are even as they who denied the Spirit \\[Jesus\\] when He came unto them with manifest dominion. Know thou that they are in the depths of vain imaginings and are unaware of it. The letters follow one another and by these letters the contingent world is enriched, but they have not understood. Their hearing is like unto the hearing of them who, when asked 'What hath your Lord revealed?', respond 'Tales of the ancients'. Say: By God! This is the ocean from whence all seas have derived. Blessed the one who hath recognized it and become cognizant of that which lieth concealed therein. \\[...\\] Those who are the heralds of the names of God have appeared in the world. In truth, all outward glory and dominion is and hath ever been ordained for such as believe in God. The people are heedless and have turned away from God, being preoccupied with their own idle fancies.\n\nI shall make mention of but one utterance from the Bab, haply some may become aware of and attain unto that which is the purpose and discover it. The Bab - may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake - sent a Tablet to Shaykh Muhammad-Hasan-i-Najafi, and the bearer thereof was Mulla 'Ali-i-Bastami. This Shaykh was the chief divine of the Shi'ihs. He rejected the Tablet, waxed proud, disdained it, and spoke that which befitted his own station. Thereafter the Bab - may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake - revealed another Tablet wherein He addresseth the aforementioned Shaykh, saying: \"Verily, We raised up 'Ali from his resting-place and sent him unto thee with a Book...\" unto the end of His utterance, exalted and glorified be He. The purport of the blessed Tablet is this: \"We raised up 'Ali from his resting-place and sent him unto thee with a Book. Hadst thou recognized him and prostrated thyself before him, We would assuredly have raised up from the first letter of thee the first letter, and from the second letter the third letter. But since thou didst not recognize him, all thy deeds were rendered null and void, thou didst enter into the fire, and thou wast unaware thereof.\" By God! Were anyone to meditate upon this utterance of the Bab which hath been mentioned, he would know of a certainty that there existeth a station with God wherein names have no access. Now they have turned away from Him at Whose mention the Point of the Bayan \\[the Bab\\] said \"I am the first to worship Him.\"\n\nBy My life! If a soul were to contemplate this heralding utterance that hath been mentioned, he would know with absolute certainty that with God there is a station wherein names have no access. Now they have turned away from a station concerning which the Point of the Bayan hath said, at the mention of His name, \"I am the foremost of them that worship,\" and have clung to former tales and names. It is not known what these unjust people have understood from the previous Dispensation. The divines of Persia cursed and reviled the Truth from all pulpits. By God's life! Pure and attentive ears in this hour hearken to the lamentations of these pulpits, engaged in mourning and weeping. Say: Die in your wrath! Until ye pass beyond the gulf of names, ye shall not attain, nor ever will attain, to the ocean of inner meanings. The Kingdom of Names circleth round, and the companions of the Mount are occupied with praise and glorification. Where are they who behold all save God as non-existent and as naught? These are they who have quaffed the choice wine that is sealed, who soar above the world. These repose on the thrones of certitude, recline upon the couches of assurance, and are seated upon the cushions of tranquillity. The divine Books, both past and present, speak of such souls. Blessed are they that hear!\n\nConvey My greetings to the loved ones of that land and its surroundings. Say: O people of God! The delusions of the past have appeared; they speak of perversion and utter similar words. Enter ye into the impregnable, mighty fortress \"We belong unto God\" and behold yourselves detached from the world and all who dwell therein. This is the counsel of God from the Tongue of the Goal of all the worlds. His grace towards His loved ones is evident and manifest. Today the breezes of bounty are wafting and the ocean of generosity is surging. The disobedience of the world hath not withheld His mercy, nor hath the waywardness of the nations veiled the Sun of His bounty. Blessed are they who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and who utter the blessed words \"We turn unto Thee.\" The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon My loved ones whom the calumnies of the denouncers and the assaults of the aggressors have not deterred, who have turned their hearts to the Most Sublime Horizon and have said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings and Master of the Throne on high and of earth below, for having guided us unto Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nThe waves of the visible sea are manifest, and the lights of the sun are evident. Unto Him be praise and glory, unto Him be gratitude and splendor. He hath ever mentioned His loved ones with most excellent utterance, an utterance from which the fragrances of the One mentioned are diffused. I beseech God to aid His loved ones to perform such deeds as are worthy of these endless favors. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Kind. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Most Generous of the generous ones.\n\nThe petition that was previously sent by the loved ones of God reached the Most Holy Court and was honored to be heard. His blessed and exalted Word: O 'Ali! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of all worlds. Thy letter and that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, hath reached Us. We have heard that which thy outward and inner tongue did utter, and have answered thee with this manifest Book, each letter of which speaketh before the faces of the world. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with mighty sovereignty. O 'Ali! Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My loving-kindness, that the sweet savors of divine revelation may attract them to a station wherein the fire of tyranny shall not deter them from the direction of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. O Muhammad-Taqi! We have heard thy call and beheld thy name. We make mention of thee in this perspicuous Tablet. When thou hearest the call of Him Who is wronged from the precincts of the Prison, and art attracted by My choice sealed wine, say \\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me, for having made me know Thee, and for having caused me to hear Thy verses and Thy days. I beseech Thee by the Word through which the dead were raised up, the trumpet was sounded, and the mountains were moved, to make me one of those whom neither the might of the world hath deterred from drawing nigh unto Thy Most Great Name, nor the clamor of men hath kept back from turning toward Thy Name, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and by the lights of the suns of Thy favors to make me not deprived of the manifestations of the Sun of Thy unity, nor withheld from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWe make mention of him who hath been named 'Ali (Mulla) in the Kingdom of Names, that the Call may attract him to the Most Exalted Horizon and the Hand of Bounty may give him to drink of the choice wine of Glory through My Most Glorious Name. Thus have We sent down the verses as a grace from Us, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Take thou the Book with the power bestowed by Us, and be not of the patient ones. Beware lest the hosts of the world frighten thee or the might of the sovereigns weaken thee. Cast aside what the people possess in this Day wherein the Self-Subsisting calleth and summoneth the servants unto His sealed wine, which if anyone should drink thereof, neither the croaking of the croakers would sadden him, nor would the doubts of the doubters hinder him. We counsel thee and those who have believed to be trustworthy and chaste, and to that whereby the stations of man are exalted. Thy Lord is verily the Manifest Counselor. God hath forgiven thee and thy father and thy mother as a mercy from Him, and We ask Him to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and benefit thee in all His worlds. He is verily the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Karbila'i Isma'il! Praise be to God that thou hast turned unto the waves of the divine ocean of utterance and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of inner meanings, unto the Straight Path and the Great News. This is a great bounty and a mighty station. Implore thou His protection from Him. That which thou didst beseech from God, exalted be His glory, hath been heard, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst commit all affairs unto Him and hold fast unto the cord of trust in Him, for man knoweth not what profiteth or harmeth him. None knoweth the unseen save Him. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! This servant of Thine hath turned unto Thee and confesseth his ignorance before the dawning of the Sun of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee to ordain for him that which shall profit him. Thou knowest what he hath and he knoweth not what Thou hast, and Thou art verily the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nO Haji Malik-Muhammad! He who loved Me hath mentioned thee. We have mentioned thee with verses that are not equaled by whatsoever hath been created on earth. Thy Lord is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thy name hath attained unto My presence. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having aided thee to recognize Him Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities and treasured in the hearts of the Messengers. Say:\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me in Thy Most Exalted Station and for having sent down for me that whose fragrance shall never fade throughout the continuance of Thy Name, the All-Compelling over those who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech Thee to ordain for me steadfastness in Thy Cause. Thou art verily the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Karbila'i Rama?an! We have heard thy call and have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison. Praise be to God that thou hast turned unto Him and hast attained unto the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of bounty of the One desired by all the worlds. Today the ocean of grace is manifest before all faces and the sun of generosity is shining from the horizon of the world. Blessed are they whom the events of the world have not prevented, nor kept back from remembrance and praise. Take thou My Book and say: Unto Thee be glory, O Thou Desire of the world, and unto Thee be praise, O Thou Beloved of them that have recognized Thee.\n\nO Ibrahim (Haji Mulla), hear My call which hath been raised from the precincts of My prison, summoning mankind unto Mine horizon, heralding unto them My mercy, and drawing them nigh unto the Mighty, the Great. We have heard thy call and have addressed thee from the Most Exalted Paradise's right hand side. There is none other God but He, the Compassionate, the Generous. He hath appeared and revealed whatsoever He willeth, a command from His presence, and He is the Almighty, the Omnipotent. The world's might hath not hindered Him, nor hath the oppressors' tyranny frightened Him. He hath spoken before all faces: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds.\" Blessed is he who hath heard the call and responded to his Ancient Lord. Woe betide him who hath denied and turned away from this Momentous News. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn towards Him when every ignorant one remote from Him turned away. Behold the divines of Iran who awaited throughout centuries and ages the advent of God and His sovereignty. Yet when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One came from the heaven of their Lord, the All-Choosing's will, they arose in opposition until they pronounced against Him an injustice whereat the realities of all things lamented, and beyond them the near ones and the sincere. Thus have We adorned thee with the traces of My Most Exalted Pen that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful.\n\nO Muhammad, My glory be upon thee! Thou didst seek bounty for the people of Kakhk. A blessed tablet hath been sent down and dispatched from the Kingdom of divine knowledge. We beseech God to cause all to attain unto it, that they may drink from the ocean of utterance and be illumined by the lights of the Day-Star of true divine unity. He is the All-Bountiful, He is the Generous.\n\nO Rida, say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the mysteries of Thy knowledge to make me among those who desire naught save what Thou hast desired for them through Thy bounty and decreed for them through Thy command. O my Lord! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. I beseech Thee to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne and earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nO Muhammad Husayn, thy name hath been mentioned and these verses have been revealed and inscribed in thy honor. His grace hath encompassed the world and His mercy hath embraced all, yet in most cities the hosts of self and passion have prevailed over godliness. We beseech God to grant strength and power that the servants of earth may attain unto that for which they were brought from nothingness into being.\n\nO Nasrullah, hear what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an: \"When God's help and victory come, and thou seest men entering God's religion in throngs.\" In truth, on the day of victory and triumph, all are seen submissive and humble. Blessed is the soul that in these days hath attained the honor of acceptance. The Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - commanded holy war. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - commanded assistance. Yet this Wronged One hath strictly forbidden in the Tablets all conflict, strife, sword and spear, and hath commanded all to assist God's Cause through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and to conquer the cities of hearts. Blessed are they who act accordingly.\n\nO Kuchak, thy mention hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and the Wronged One's countenance is at this moment turned toward thee, making mention of thee. Shouldst thou comprehend this station's rank, thou wouldst, until the grave, utter the blessed words \"Praise be unto Thee, O Single One, O Unique One.\" The glory shining from the heaven of My mercy's horizon be upon My loved ones who have attained unto My days and have acknowledged that which hath been sent down from the heaven of their Lord's will, the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Ali! Each of the aforementioned names has attained that which has had and has no likeness or equal. Some have desired to attain Our presence; however, due to certain circumstances in these days, it was not and is not expedient. You should give glad-tidings to all on behalf of the Wronged One and gladden them with the Tablet of God.\n\nO My beloved! The exalted standards and divine banners are manifest and evident from the clear signs. This servant beseeches and hopes for the divine grace that He may cause His loved ones to attain that which befits His Day. His standards and banners have been and are the manifestations of His commandments and prohibitions. Repeatedly from the Most Exalted Pen this most sublime word hath been revealed, blessed and exalted be His utterance: \"The hosts of divine ethics and deeds are the helpers of this Cause, and the commander of these hosts is the fear of God.\"\n\nThis is the word that should any fair-minded person hear it, he would speak with justice and converse with equity. O My beloved! The sending of the reply to the letter was greatly delayed. In any case, forgiveness has been and is sought, for time was lacking and opportunity absent. I beseech you and the loved ones to pray for divine assistance and confirmation for this evanescent one, as time is outwardly short and the task momentous. There is no power nor strength except through God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nConcerning the mention made of Aqa Muhammad-Rida and Aqa Siyyid Muhammad, upon them be the glory of God, and likewise their degree of enkindlement with the fire of God's love, after presentation before Him, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, blessed and exalted be His utterance:\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed\n\nThis is a mention from Us unto him who was named Muhammad before Rida, that the mention may draw him unto God, the Lord of all names, and make him of those whom the veils of the world have not caused to slip nor the signs of the deniers hindered. We have heard thy mention and make mention of thee with a mention whereby the hearts of those near unto God are drawn. We counsel thee and those who have believed to fear God, the Lord of all worlds. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, Thy grace hath delivered me, Thy verses have taken hold of me, and the light of Thy Cause hath guided me to Thy straight path. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the effulgences of the sun of Thy manifestation to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have turned to Thy most exalted horizon and supreme height. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones in Thy days. I am he who, O my God, hath acknowledged Thy Book and what hath been sent down therein of Thy commandments and ordinances and that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken. I beseech Thee, O Quickener of the graves and Manifestor of light, by Thy most glorious path and Thy most great announcement, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficing, the Most Exalted.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God \\[...\\]\n\nIn the Name of God!\n\nO Muhammad! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily it will draw thee nigh unto Mine horizon, and will aid thee to stand firm in My Cause, and will give thee to drink of the Kawthar of Mine utterance from the hand of My bounty, and will guide thee to the station which God hath made the most exalted of stations. We have manifested the Cause before the faces of all peoples - among them are those who turned away, those who hesitated, those who pronounced sentence upon the shedding of My blood, and those who turned towards Me and said: \"Here am I, O Thou Desire of the Worlds! Here am I, O Thou in Whose grasp lieth the reins of all men!\" Blessed is the servant who hath heard and responded, and woe unto every denier who hath turned away from God in his final end. O Muhammad! Take thou the chalice of immortality in My Most Great Name, then drink therefrom in spite of the enemies who turned away from the Face, having followed the sources of vain imaginings. Thus hath the Divine Lote-Tree spoken that which draweth the hearts of the righteous. When thou hast drunk of My choice-sealed wine in My Self-Subsisting Name, say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and for having made known unto me the Dayspring of Thy signs, the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens and the Source of Thy commandments. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the worlds to come and of those gone before. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\"\n\nMention was made of Karbila'i Muhammad (the barber), upon him be the Glory of God. After it was presented before the Most Holy Court, this utterance was revealed from the Kingdom of divine grace - exalted be His glory: O Muhammad! The friends of God have ever been and are blessed with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Thy mention is remembered and thy name is known. God willing, thou shalt hold fast unto the Book of God with such firmness that all the world shall be powerless to separate thee from it. Praise be to God that thou hast hearkened unto the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen and hast drunk from the ocean of knowledge of the Desire of the worlds. We beseech God to aid thee to remain steadfast in this Most Great Cause. We ask God to forgive thee, thy father, thy mother, and thy wife. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which beseemeth this glorious and wondrous Day. We have mentioned and continue to mention the loved ones of that land, one and all, and We command them all to fear God, which is the crown of all deeds. Blessed are they who act, and woe unto those who neglect. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAn incalculable bounty hath been manifested, such that were all the atoms of creation to be transformed into pens, and all the seas into ink, they would be unable to render thanks for these manifest and resplendent favors. Who hath the capacity and power to offer fitting thanks? However, since the acknowledgment of powerlessness is beloved, perchance this powerlessness may become the cause of acceptance and lead to success. In the nights and days He hath remembered His loved ones and commanded them to that which will exalt their stations and ranks, through utterances from whose every letter doth shine forth the sun of loving-kindness. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nA petition submitted in the name of Muhammad Husayn (son of Mulla Abu'l-Qasim) and Aqa Khalilu'llah and Aqa Asadu'llah, the two nephews of the honored teacher - upon him and upon them be the Glory of God - was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and these manifest verses were revealed from the Dayspring of bounty and the Ocean of grace specifically for them - blessed and exalted be His Word:\n\nIn the name of the One God \\[...\\]\n\nO My loved ones! Your letter was presented before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison and gained the honor of being heard. Praise be to God, it testified to your awareness and to your acceptance, attention and love for the Beloved of the worlds. We beseech God to assist you in exalting His Word through wisdom and utterance, and to sanctify you from whatsoever is unworthy of the station of man. Today the Tongue of Grandeur proclaims: By God's life! The sun has neither shone nor risen upon such a day. All must recognize the value of these divine days and aid the Cause of God through goodly deeds. Praise ye the Desired One of the world Who has mentioned you - a mention whose fragrance is everlasting and enduring. We beseech God to assist you in that which He loves and is pleased with, to make you among those who have drunk the choice wine of utterance from the cups of their Lord's bountiful gifts, the Compassionate, the Generous, and to ordain for you that which shall be as light before your faces in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to grant this prayer. Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause and this Great Announcement.\n\nAnd likewise the petition of the two sons of the martyred Ni'matullah and Nasrullah, upon him and them be the Glory of God, was presented before Him and gained the honor of being heard, and these verses were revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful's utterance specifically for them. His exalted Word:\n\nIn the Name of the Desired One of the World\n\nThe servant was present with your petition and presented it all, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed in response from the Sacred Kingdom, that ye may drink from the Euphrates of utterance and receive your portion from the Kawthar of divine knowledge. The relatives of the departed, elevated teacher - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - and the martyr have ever been and are mentioned before the Wronged One. We beseech God to enable you to preserve the pearls of His love. The treacherous have been and are lying in wait for this precious gem. The ignorant and heedless servants who are unaware of the root of the Cause are striving and struggling to mislead sanctified souls, and through various forms of deceit and guile have been and are attempting to prevent them. We beseech God to assist you with such assistance that the ranks of the world shall be powerless to prevent and the might of nations shall not weaken you. Stand firm in His Cause through divine power and might, and be vocal in His remembrance and praise. We counsel all to observe calmness, dignity and wisdom, lest the clamor of the ignorant be raised in ignorance. There are learned ones who are deprived and prevented from the Dawning Place of divine revelation and the ocean of heavenly knowledge. We mention the loved ones of that land and its surroundings and counsel them to that which is befitting. Glory be upon you, O My loved ones, from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Sun of Divine Utterance has shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's mercy in such wise that its light has encompassed the dust of earth and indeed all the world, and its fragrance has perfumed it. Should one possessed of the sense of smell be in the furthermost parts of the world, he would detect this diffused fragrance, would turn with heart and soul, and would remain occupied with remembrance and praise throughout his life. One is astonished at what has prevented the eyes of the people of the world and what has veiled the sense of smell of the nations. Strange and wondrous is it that some of the ignorant ones of the world have denied this Most Great Cause and seek to establish another. Glory be to God! If this Cause be denied, what other cause would be worthy of affirmation or mention? We must beseech God that perchance the oppressors may attain unto justice and the workers of tyranny unto equity.\n\nLikewise the petition of Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. He says, blessed and exalted be He: \"O 'Ali-Akbar! Thy letter arrived and We saw and heard it. Praise be to God that thou hast turned unto Him and attained the honor of recognition. Thou didst seek His presence from the Wronged One. O 'Ali-Akbar! The heedless servants have become a barrier and have prevented the people from the Truth. Be not grieved at being deprived of His presence and meeting. Beseech God that He may ordain for thee from the Most Exalted Pen the reward of His presence. He is the Lord of Command and the Sovereign of Decree. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. The creatures of the first and the last are powerless to prevent His Will. The power of His Word and the penetration of His Purpose are manifest as the sun. Blessed is the eye that seeth and woe unto every heedless doubter. The souls mentioned in thy petition have each attained unto the Luminary of Utterance, the Goal of all the worlds. We give them glad tidings of My remembrance and My favor, and We counsel them with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Possessor of the Exalted Seat.\"\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call, shown me Thy tokens and summoned me from the precincts of Thy prison. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause, through which they that are sincere hastened to the seat of sacrifice and they that are devoted to the highest horizon, to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, such that neither the hosts of the oppressors nor the might of the polytheists shall prevent me. O my Lord! I testify that Thou hast created me to know the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Source of Thy commandments and ordinances, and to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Tablets. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty through which the ocean of existence hath surged, and by the generosity through which Thou hast quickened the world and its peoples, to ordain for me and for those with me that which shall cause us to be numbered with them that have attained unto Thy good-pleasure and have quaffed the choice wine of detachment from the hands of Thy bestowal. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis was revealed for Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the One Who ruleth over all who are in earth and heaven.\n\nThe divine call hath ever been raised and the Light of Manifestation hath shone and been evident from the horizon of the heaven of Sinai. Dark clouds pursue this light, and clouds of hatred follow after it. Though in these days they have prevented the lights of the Sun of Truth from shining, yet ultimately the light shall prevail, the Cause shall be made manifest, and the decree shall be seen to dominate. We counsel the friends of God, exalted be His glory, to be trustworthy and religious, and to that which is the cause of the exaltation and elevation of the Word of God. O people of God! From your qualities the qualities of God should be observed, and your deeds and your rest and motion should become mirrors of the will of God. This Wronged One hath ever commanded those that have turned to Him and loved Him to that which leadeth to glory and sublimity. The atoms of all created things bear witness that He hath desired naught for Himself. Praise thou the Lord of eternity Who hath mentioned thee while He is afflicted by the calumnies of the peoples. We beseech God to grant thee and the friends in that land success and to confirm you in mention, praise, wisdom and utterance. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Commander, the Ruler, the Mighty, the Bestower. Take counsel in matters. Act upon what proceedeth from consultation, for We have enjoined consultation upon all in numerous Tablets. We beseech God to confirm thee and His friends in that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him, and We beseech Him to forgive thy father and mother and those who have ascended unto Him. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful and the God of all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nWho can ever adequately render thanks for these bounties? Nay, by His very Self, no one hath been or ever shall be capable of this. Were all the pens of the world and the tongues of nations to speak forth the most praiseworthy mentions of the first and the last, these could never equal a single word of those words which have shone forth from the Dayspring of Will. Yet since we are commanded to offer praise and thanksgiving, we therefore cling to the cord of His remembrance. Otherwise, how can the mention of creatures compare with His most holy and most pure court? In any case, we are His and we beseech from Him that which beseemeth His generosity. This servant beseecheth the Lord of existence to set His loved ones ablaze in such wise that the world shall be set aflame. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.\n\nO 'Ali before Akbar! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. He verily remembereth thee and draweth thee nigh and teacheth thee that which beseemeth the days of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. Repeatedly hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and time and again hast thou been favored with the tokens of the Pen of Command. Ponder thou upon that which hath been sent down from the heaven of God's will. In every utterance lieth concealed the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Blessed are they that drink thereof! I swear by the Sun of Truth that whosoever shall today observe the divine verses with the eye of justice and fairness shall be sustained by the Kawthar of steadfastness and shall find himself detached from all else but God. When thou art illumined by the lights of the Orb of My proof and hast drunk the Salsabil of knowledge from the chalices of My verses, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me and magnified me and honored me and made me to know Thee. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the world and Light shining amidst the nations, by Thy Most Great Name through which the limbs of the aggressive ones among Thy servants and the idolaters among Thy creatures have trembled, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love and acting according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThis servant likewise beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid him to champion His Cause in such wise that the fame of his steadfastness may spread throughout all lands and regions. Should they consider the signs, tokens and verses of the Messengers, and ponder that which hath been revealed and made manifest in this Most Great Revelation from the heaven of bounty, they would testify with absolute certainty to the greatness, power, sovereignty and all-encompassing nature of this Most Great Revelation over all past and future Manifestations. God willing, they are aided to make mention and offer praise and serve the Cause of God - our purpose and the purpose of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of them that know.\n\nAs for what was mentioned in the previous letter regarding traveling to different regions for the purpose of teaching God's Cause, after its presentation They said that in these matters consultation must be made. We beseech God to establish this decree - that is, consultation - which We have in these days made binding, that all may adhere to it henceforth. O 'Ali! In the path of God thou hast witnessed and heard that which caused the greatest sorrow. No deed is ever lost in the sight of God, nor shall it ever be. The deeds of His loved ones in His path are each like unto a treasure in the keeping of a Trustee to Whose trustworthiness all things have testified and do testify.\n\nAs for appointing this evanescent one as representative specifically for visitation on Friday the seventeenth of the month of Rabi'u'l-Avval at noon, after permission was granted, this one presented himself and there was fulfilled that which hath been the purpose of that Beloved One and all the chosen ones of God, past and future. How blessed are mine eyes and thine eyes, and how blessed am I and art thou! We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid us in remembrance and praise, and in attaining His presence and circumambulating His shrine. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nIn the Name of Him Who speaks with wisdom!\n\nO son of Azghand, upon thee be the Glory of God! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before the Throne hath presented it. We have revealed for thee a Tablet whereby the cities of knowledge and wisdom have been perfumed. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower. We have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison as a token of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe counsel thee and those who have believed to be characterized by trustworthiness, righteousness, truthfulness and purity. Blessed is the servant who acteth in accordance with what hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Lord of all lords. Hearken unto the call from the direction of 'Akka - verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Blessed be thy father, again blessed be he! He informed My servants of My Manifestation before I manifested Myself. Verily nothing is hidden from thy Lord's knowledge. He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nWe have mentioned him in the Crimson Tablet with My Most Exalted Pen in such wise that his remembrance shall endure among all mentions and his spirit among all spirits. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Take hold of God's Tablet with the power bestowed by Him and follow not those who follow the sources of fancy and imagination. Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, the All-Merciful hath come, He for Whom the Point of the Bayan sacrificed Himself in His path. Fear God, O people of fairness! Be just concerning God's Cause and His Manifestation. He hath come from the heaven of proof with verses which have left those of understanding powerless to comprehend them. Say: Cast away what ye possess and take what ye have been given by God, the Illuminator of all horizons. O son of Ahmad, upon him be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness! When the breezes of My revelation stir thee and the wine of My utterance intoxicates thee, say \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Prison, and by Thy imprisonment in the Land of Ta, and by another imprisonment in another land, and by Thy mighty signs, to assist me and Thy loved ones in that which befitteth Thy days and beseemeth Thy station. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and clinging to Thee. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by the banners of Thy signs and the emblems of Thy power and sovereignty, to make me steadfast, firm, upright and unwavering in Thy Cause, through which the limbs of the learned have quaked, the hearts of the divines have trembled, and the feet of the wise have slipped, save those whom the hands of Thy favor have delivered. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nSuch bounty and mercy hath been manifested as the eye of creation hath neither seen nor shall see the like thereof. O people of God! Know ye the worth of this most exalted station and this ultimate goal, and in the nights and days hold fast unto service to His Cause. The victorious hosts are wisdom and utterance and deeds and character. Blessed is he who aids the Cause of his Lord through wisdom and utterance and through that which hath been revealed in the Book. Convey my greetings and salutations to all the friends in that land and its surroundings. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist them in that which beseemeth this blessed Day. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon God's loved ones there and upon all who are steadfast and upright. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nThe Servant\n\n18th of Rabi'u'l-Avval 1305\n\n=== END BH00046 ===\n\n=== START BH00047 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath made being to come forth from nothingness; graven upon the tablet of man a measure of the mysteries of His eternity; taught him from the storehouse of divine utterance that which he knew not; made him a perspicuous book unto such as have believed and surrendered their souls; given him to behold, in this dark and ruinous age, a new creation within all things; and caused him to speak forth, from the midmost heart of eternity, and in a new and wondrous voice, embodied in the most excellent Temple. And all to this end: that every man may testify, in himself and by himself, before the Seat of the revelation of his Lord, that there is none other God but Him; and that all may reach that summit of realities where none shall contemplate anything but that he shall perceive God therein. This is the vision of the splendours which have been deposited within the realities of all things; for otherwise He, exalted be His glory, is entirely sanctified above being seen or witnessed: \"No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision; He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.\"\n\nAnd I praise and glorify that primal Sea which hath branched out from the ocean of the unseen Essence, and that primal Morn which hath broken forth upon the horizon of Singleness, and that primal Sun which hath risen in the heaven of everlasting splendour, and that primal Fire which was kindled from the Lamp of eternity within the Niche of oneness: He Who is called \"Ahmad\" in the kingdom of the exalted ones, and \"Muhammad\" amongst the concourse of the favoured ones, and \"Mahmud\" in the realm of the sincere; and in the hearts of the knowing, \"whichsoever ye call upon, most beauteous are His names.\" And upon His kindred and His companions be abundant, abiding, and eternal peace!\n\nI have hearkened to the song of the nightingale of knowledge upon the twigs of the tree of thine inmost being, and to the cooing of the dove of certitude upon the branches of the bower of thine heart. Methinks I inhaled the fragrance of purity from the raiment of thy love and, in perusing thy letter, attained thy very presence. I noted, moreover, thine allusions to thy death in God and thy life through Him, and the love thou dost cherish for the beloved of the Lord and for the Manifestations of His names and the Exponents of His attributes. I have purposed, therefore, to acquaint thee with holy and resplendent tokens from the realms of might and glory, that haply they may draw thee nigh unto the court of holiness, nearness, and beauty, and draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt see naught in all existence but the hallowed Countenance of thy Beloved, and wilt behold all of creation as a day wherein none was deemed worthy of mention. Of this did the nightingale of oneness sing in the garden of his mystical treatise, saying, \"And there shall appear upon the tablet of thine heart an inscription of the subtle mysteries of the verse 'Fear ye God; God will teach you', and the bird of thy spirit shall recall the sanctuaries of ancient splendour, and soar upon the wings of longing into the heaven of the command 'Walk the beaten paths of thy Lord', and partake of the choice fruits of communion in the gardens of the utterance 'Feed, moreover, on every kind of fruit.'\" By My life, O friend! Wert thou to taste the fruits of these verdant trees that spring from the soil of true understanding, once the effulgent light of His Essence hath been reflected in the Mirrors of His names and attributes, yearning would seize the reins of patience and restraint from out thy hand and stir thy spirit into commotion with the splendours of His light. It would draw thee from this abode of dust unto thy true and heavenly habitation in the midmost heart of mystic knowledge, and raise thee to a station wherein thou wilt soar in the air even as thou treadest upon the earth, and wilt walk upon the water even as thou movest over the land. Wherefore, may it rejoice me, and thee, and whosoever mounteth into the heaven of knowledge, and whose heart hath been revived by the breezes of certitude that waft from the Sheba of the All-Merciful upon the meadow of his inner being. Peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance!\n\nAnd further: the stages that mark the wayfarers' journey from their mortal abode to the heavenly homeland are said to be seven. Some have referred to them as seven valleys, and others, as seven cities. And it is said that until the wayfarer taketh leave of self and traverseth these stages, he shall never attain the ocean of nearness and reunion nor taste of the matchless wine.\n\nThe first is the Valley of Search. The steed of this valley is patience; without patience the wayfarer on this journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever become downhearted: If he strive for a hundred thousand years and yet fail to behold the beauty of the Friend, he should not falter. For those who seek the Kaaba of \"for Us\" rejoice in the tidings \"In Our ways shall We assuredly guide them.\" In their search, they have stoutly girded up the loins of service and at every moment journey from the plane of heedlessness into the realm of search. No bond shall hold them back and no counsel deter them.\n\nIt is incumbent upon these servants to cleanse the heart, which is the wellspring of divine treasures, of every marking; turn away from imitation, which is following the traces of their forefathers; and shut the door of friendship and enmity upon all the people of the earth.\n\nIn this journey the seeker reacheth a station wherein he seeth all created things wandering distracted in search of the Friend. How many a Jacob will he see searching after his Joseph, how many a lover will he behold hastening towards the Well-Beloved; a world of adoring souls will he witness tracing the path of the Adored One! At every moment he findeth a weighty matter, in every hour he becometh aware of a new mystery; for he hath severed his heart from both worlds and set out for the Kaaba of the Beloved. At every step, aid from the invisible Realm will attend him and the fervour of his search will grow.\n\nOne must judge of search by the standard of the Majnun of love. It is related that one day they came upon Majnun sifting the dust, his tears flowing down. They asked, \"What doest thou?\" He said, \"I seek for Layli.\" \"Alas for thee!\" they cried, \"Layli is of pure spirit, yet thou seekest her in the dust!\" He said, \"I seek her everywhere; haply somewhere I shall find her.\"\n\nYea, though to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord of Lords in the dust, yet this betokeneth intense ardour in searching. \"Whoso seeketh out a thing and persisteth with zeal shall find it.\"\n\nThe true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest, and the sincere lover hath no desire save reunion with his beloved. Nor shall the seeker reach his goal unless he sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and heard, and understood--all he must set at naught with \"no God is there\", that he may enter into the realm of the spirit, which is the city of \"but God\". Labour is needed, if we are to seek Him; ardour is needed, if we are to drink the nectar of reunion with Him; and if we taste of this cup, we shall cast away the world.\n\nOn this journey the wayfarer dwelleth in every abode, however humble, and resideth in every land. In every face he seeketh the beauty of the Friend; in every region he searcheth after the Beloved. He joineth every company and seeketh fellowship with every soul, that haply in some heart he may discern the secret of the Beloved, or in some face behold the beauty of the Adored One.\n\nAnd if, by the help of the Creator, he findeth on this journey a trace of the traceless Friend, and inhaleth the fragrance of the long-lost Joseph from the heavenly herald, he shall straightway step into the Valley of Love and be consumed in the fire of love. In this city the heaven of rapture is upraised, and the world-illuming sun of yearning shineth, and the fire of love is set ablaze; and when the fire of love is ablaze, it burneth to ashes the harvest of reason.\n\nNow is the wayfarer oblivious of himself, and of aught besides himself. He seeth neither ignorance nor knowledge, neither doubt nor certitude; he knoweth not the morn of guidance from the night of error. He fleeth from both unbelief and faith, and findeth in deadly poison his heart's relief. Wherefore 'A??ar saith: For the infidel, error--for the faithful, faith; For 'A??ar's heart, an atom of thy pain.\n\nThe steed of this valley is pain, and if there be no pain this journey will never end. In this plane the lover hath no thought save the Beloved, and seeketh no refuge save the Friend. At every moment he offereth a hundred lives in the path of the Loved One, at every step he throweth a thousand heads at His feet.\n\nO My brother! Until thou enter the Egypt of love, thou shalt never gaze upon the Joseph-like beauty of the Friend; and until, like Jacob, thou forsake thine outward eyes, thou shalt never open the eye of thine inward being; and until thou burn with the fire of love, thou shalt never find thyself in true yearning's embrace.\n\nA lover feareth nothing and can suffer no harm: Thou seest him chill in the fire and dry in the sea. A lover is he who is chill in hellfire; A knower is he who is dry in the sea.\n\nLove accepteth no existence and wisheth no life: In death it seeth life, and in shame it seeketh glory. To merit the madness of love, one must abound in sanity; to merit the bonds of the Friend, one must be free in spirit. Blessed the neck that is caught in His noose, and happy the head that falleth on the dust in the path of His love. Wherefore, O friend, renounce thy self, that thou mayest find the Peerless One; and soar beyond this mortal world, that thou mayest find thy nest in the abode of heaven. Be as naught, if thou wouldst kindle the fire of being and be fit for the pathway of love. Ne'er will love allow a living soul to tread its way; Ne'er will the falcon deign to seize a lifeless prey.\n\nLove setteth a world aflame at every turn and layeth waste every land wherein it raiseth its banner. Being hath no existence in its kingdom; the wise wield no command within its realm. The leviathan of love swalloweth the master of reason and slayeth the lord of knowledge. It drinketh the seven seas, but its heart's thirst is still unquenched and it asketh, \"Is there yet any more?\" It shunneth its own self and draweth away from all on earth. Love shunneth this world and that world too; In him are lunacies seventy-and-two.\n\nLove hath bound a myriad victims in its fetters and pierced a myriad wise men with its arrow. Know that every redness thou seest in the world is from its wrath, and every paleness in men's cheeks is from its poison. It yieldeth no remedy but death and walketh not save in the valley of extinction; yet sweeter than honey is its venom upon the lover's lips, and fairer its deadly sting, in the seeker's sight, than a hundred thousand lives.\n\nWherefore must the veils of the satanic self be burned away in the fire of love, that the spirit may be cleansed and refined, and thus may apprehend the station of Him but for Whom the world would not have been created. Kindle the fire of love and burn away all things; Then set thy foot into the land of the lovers.\n\n\\]\n\nAnd if, confirmed by the Creator, the lover escapeth the claws of the eagle of love, he will enter the Realm of Knowledge and come out of doubt into certitude, and turn from the darkness of wayward desire to the guiding light of the fear of God. His inner eye will open and he will privily converse with his Beloved; he will unlock the gates of truth and supplication and shut the doors of idle fancy. He in this realm is content with the divine decree, and seeth war as peace, and in death findeth the meaning of everlasting life. With both inward and outward eyes he witnesseth the mysteries of resurrection in the realms of creation and in the souls of men, and with a spiritual heart apprehendeth the wisdom of God in His endless manifestations. In the sea he findeth a drop, in a drop he beholdeth the secrets of the sea. Split the atom's heart, and lo! Within it thou wilt find a sun. Gazing with the eye of absolute insight, the wayfarer in this valley seeth in God's creation neither contradiction nor incongruity, and at every moment exclaimeth, \"No defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of mercy. Repeat the gaze: Seest thou a single flaw?\" He beholdeth justice in injustice, and in justice, grace. In ignorance he findeth many a knowledge hidden, and in knowledge a myriad wisdoms manifest. He breaketh the cage of the body and the hold of the passions, and communeth with the denizens of the immortal realm. He scaleth the ladders of inner truth and hasteneth to the heaven of inner meanings. He rideth in the ark of \"We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves\", and saileth upon the sea of \"until it become plain to them that it is the truth\". And if he meeteth with injustice he shall have patience, and if he cometh upon wrath he shall manifest love. There was once a lover, it is said, who had sighed for long years in separation from his beloved, and wasted in the fire of remoteness. From the rule of love, his breast was void of patience and his body weary of his spirit; he reckoned life without her as a mockery, and the world consumed him away. How many a day he found no respite from his longing; how many a night the pain of her kept him from sleep. His body was worn to a sigh, and his heart's wound had turned him to a cry of sorrow. A thousand lives would he freely have given for one taste of the cup of her presence, and yet even this was not within his reach. The doctors knew no cure for him, and companions avoided his company; yea, physicians have no remedy for one sick of love, unless the favour of the beloved deliver him.\n\nSuch is the effect of God's command; whenever you mix sugar with mud, the purity of the sugar will overcome the impurity of the mud. In this way these blessed souls see the end in the beginning, and in extinction they discern a revival. This station can be discovered by any soul who journeyeth upon the path of guidance. In every atom he will find a door leading to the mysteries of divine knowledge. He will discern in all things the mysteries of divine Revelation and the evidences of an everlasting manifestation.\n\n\\[Since the text is already in English, no translation is needed.\\]\n\nSuch is the state of the wayfarers in this valley, but the people of the valleys above this see the end and the beginning as one. Nay, they see neither \"beginning\" nor \"end\" and witness neither \"first\" nor \"last\". Nay rather, the denizens of the city of immortality, who dwell in the celestial garden, see not even \"neither first nor last\": They fly from all that is first and repulse all that is last. For these have passed over the worlds of names and, swift as lightning, fled beyond the worlds of attributes. Thus is it said: \"The perfection of belief in Divine Unity is to deny Him any attributes.\" And they have made their dwelling-place in the shadow of the Divine Essence.\n\nWherefore Khajih 'Abdu'llah --may God the Most High sanctify his blessed soul--hath made, in this connection, a subtle point and spoken an eloquent word as to the meaning of \"Guide Thou us on the straight path\", which is: \"Show us the right way; that is, honour us with the love of Thine Essence, that we may be freed from occupation with ourselves and aught else save Thee, and may become wholly Thine; that we may know only Thee, and see only Thee, and think of none save Thee.\"\n\nNay, they would even soar above this station, as it is said: \"Love is a veil betwixt the lover and beloved.\" \"More than this I am not permitted to tell.\"\n\nAt this hour the morn of true knowledge hath dawned and the lamps of wayfaring and wandering have been quenched. Veiled from this was Moses too, Despite His virtue and His light. Then thou who hast no wings at all, Abandon any hope of flight!\n\nIf thou be a man of communion and prayer, soar upon the wings of assistance from the holy ones, that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the Friend and attain the lights of the Beloved: \"Verily, we are God's, and to Him shall we return.\"\n\nAfter passing through the Valley of Knowledge, which is the last station of limitation, the wayfarer cometh to the First Station of Unity and drinketh from the cup of oneness, and gazeth upon the manifestations of singleness. In this station he pierceth the veils of plurality, fleeth the realms of the flesh, and ascendeth unto the heaven of unity. With the ear of God he heareth; with the eye of God he beholdeth the mysteries of divine creation. He steppeth into the inner sanctuary of the Friend and, as an intimate, shareth the pavilion of the Well-Beloved. He stretcheth forth the hand of truth from the sleeve of the Absolute and revealeth the mysteries of divine power. He seeth in himself neither name nor fame nor rank, but findeth his own praise in the praise of God, and in the name of God beholdeth his own. To him \"all songs are from that sovereign King\" and every melody from Him. He sitteth on the throne of \"Say, all things are of God\" and reclineth upon the seat of \"There is no power nor strength but in God alone.\" He looketh upon all things with the eye of Unity, and seeth the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth shining from the dayspring of the Divine Essence upon all created things alike, and beholdeth the lights of Unity reflected upon all creation.\n\nIt is known to thine eminence that all the variations which the wayfarer in the stages of his journey beholdeth in the realms of being proceed from his own vision. We shall give an example of this, that the meaning may become fully clear. Consider the visible sun: Although it shineth with the same radiance upon all existence, and at the behest of the Lord of Revelation bestoweth light on all things, yet in each place it becometh manifest and sheddeth its bounty according to the potentialities of that place. For instance, in a mirror it reflecteth its own disk and shape, and this is due to the clarity of the mirror itself; through a crystal it maketh fire to appear; and in other things it showeth only the effect of its shining, but not its full disk. And yet, through that effect, by the command of the Creator it traineth each thing according to the capacity of that thing, even as thou dost observe.\n\nIn like manner, colours become visible in each object according to its nature. For instance, in a yellow glass the rays shine yellow; in a white glass they are white; and in a red glass red rays are visible. These variations proceed from the object itself, not from the light. And if a place be shut away from the light, as by walls and a roof, it will be entirely bereft of the light of the sun and deprived of its rays.\n\nThus it is that certain feeble souls have confined the wide expanse of knowledge within the walls of self and passion, and beneath the cloak of ignorance and blindness, and have thereby veiled themselves from the light of the mystic Sun and the mysteries of the eternal Beloved. They have strayed far from the gem-like wisdom of the resplendent Faith of the Lord of the Messengers, have been shut out of the inner court of the All-Beauteous, and have been banished from the Kaaba of glory. Such is the worth of the people of this age!\n\nAnd if a nightingale soar beyond the clay of self and dwell in the rose bower of the heart, and in Arabian melodies and sweet Persian tones recount the mysteries of God--a single word whereof quickeneth anew every lifeless form and bestoweth the spirit of holiness upon every mouldering bone--thou wilt behold a thousand claws of envy and a myriad talons of hatred hunting after Him and striving with all their power to encompass His death.\n\nYea, to the beetle a sweet fragrance seemeth foul, and to the man sick of a rheum a pleasant perfume availeth naught. Wherefore hath it been said for the guidance of the ignorant:\n\nCleanse thou the rheum from out thine head\n\nAnd breathe the breath of God instead.\n\nIn sum, the differences among objects have now been made plain. Thus when the wayfarer gazeth only upon the place of appearance--that is, when he considereth only the glass--he seeth yellow and red and white. And so it is that conflict hath prevailed amongst men, and a darksome dust from limited souls hath settled over the world. Others gaze upon the effulgence of the light, while yet others have drunk of the wine of oneness and see naught but the sun itself.\n\nAs the wayfarers traverse these three differing planes, their understanding and their words differ accordingly, and hence the sign of conflict hath ever appeared on earth. For there are some who dwell on the plane of Divine Unity and speak of that world, and some inhabit the realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are completely veiled. Thus do the ignorant people of the day, who have no share of the radiance of the divine Beauty, make certain claims and, in every age and cycle, inflict upon the people of the ocean of Divine Unity what they themselves deserve. \"If God should chastise men for their perverse doings, He would not leave upon the earth a moving thing! But to an appointed time doth He respite them.\"\n\nSince this text is already in English, and appears to be from \"The Seven Valleys\" by Baha'u'llah, no translation is needed. The text remains as presented.\n\nIndeed, the references that have been made to the degrees of mystic knowledge pertain to the knowledge of the effulgences of that Sun of Truth as it becometh reflected in various mirrors. And the effulgence of that light is present within the hearts, yet it is hidden beneath the veils of selfish desires and earthly attachments, even as a candle within a lantern of iron, and only when the cover is lifted doth the light of the candle shine out. In like manner, when thou dost strip the veils of illusion from the face of thine heart, the lights of Oneness will be made manifest. It is clear, then, that even these rays are not subject to egress or regress--how much less that Essence of existence and longed-for Mystery. O My brother, consider these matters in the spirit of enquiry, not in blind imitation. A true wayfarer will not be deterred by the impediment of words, nor daunted by the sway of insinuations. How can a curtain part the lover from his love, When Alexander's wall cannot keep them apart? Secrets are many, and strangers are myriad. Volumes will not suffice to hold the mystery of the Beloved, nor can it be exhausted in these pages, though it be no more than a word, no more than a sign. \"Knowledge is one point, which the foolish have multiplied.\"\n\nInfer, then, from this the differences among the worlds. Though the worlds of God be infinite, yet some refer to them as four: the world of time, which hath both a beginning and an end; the world of duration, which hath a beginning but whose end is not apparent; the world of primordial reality, whose beginning is not to be seen but which is known to have an end; and the world of eternity, of which neither the beginning nor the end is visible. Although there are many differing statements as to these points, to recount them in detail would result in weariness. Thus some have said that the world of primordial reality hath neither beginning nor end, and have equated the world of eternity with the invisible, inaccessible, and unknowable Essence. Others have called these the worlds of the Heavenly Court, of the Celestial Dominion, of the Divine Kingdom, and of Mortal Existence.\n\nMoreover, the journeys in the pathway of love have been reckoned as four: from the creatures to the True One, from the True One to the creatures, from the creatures to the creatures, and from the True One to the True One.\n\nThere is many an utterance of the sages and mystics of former times which I have not mentioned here, since I mislike copious citation from the sayings of the past; for quotation from the words of others betokeneth acquired learning and not divine bestowal. Even so much as I have quoted here is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the learned. Further, such matters are beyond the scope of this epistle. My unwillingness to recount their sayings is not from pride; rather, it is the manifestation of wisdom and the revelation of bounty.\n\nIf Khi?r did wreck the vessel on the sea, A thousand rights are in this wrong concealed.\n\nOtherwise, this Servant regardeth Himself as utterly lost and non-existent, even before one of the beloved of God, how much less in the presence of His holy ones. Glorified be my Lord, the Most High! Moreover, our aim is to recount the stages of the wayfarer's journey, not to set forth the conflicting utterances of the mystics.\n\nAlthough a brief example hath been given concerning the beginning and ending of the relative and contingent world, yet a further illustration is now provided, that the full meaning may become clear. For instance, let thine eminence consider his own self: Thou art first in relation to thy son, and last in relation to thy father. In thine outward appearance thou tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of divine creation; in thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries which are the divine trust deposited within thee. And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and inwardness, are, in the sense referred to, all true of thyself, so that in these four states conferred upon thee thou mayest comprehend the four divine states, and that the nightingale of thine heart, warbling on all the flowering branches of the tree of existence, whether seen or unseen, might cry out: \"He is the First and the Last, the Seen and the Hidden!\"\n\nThese statements are made in the sphere of that which is relative. Otherwise, those souls who with but one step have traversed the world of the relative and the conditioned, and dwelt in the court of independent sovereignty, and pitched their tent in the realms of absolute authority and command, have burned away these relativities with a single spark, and blotted out these words with a mere dewdrop. And they swim in the sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy atmosphere of light. Then what existence have words, on such a plane, that \"first\" and \"last\", or other than these, should be mentioned or described? In this realm, the first is the same as the last, and the last is the same as the first.\n\nIn thy soul, of love build thou a fire\n\nAnd burn all thoughts and words entire.\n\nO My friend, look to thyself: Hadst thou not become a father and begotten a son, neither wouldst thou have comprehended these words. Now forget them one and all, that thou mayest learn from the Master of Love in the schoolhouse of Divine Unity, mayest return unto God, forsake the land of unreality for thy true station, and dwell beneath the shadow of the tree of knowledge.\n\nO thou dear one! Impoverish thyself, that thou mayest enter the lofty court of riches; and humble thy body, that thou mayest drink from the stream of glory and attain to the full meaning of the poems whereof thou hadst asked.\n\nThus it hath been made clear that these stages depend on the attainment of the wayfarer. In every city he will behold a world, in every valley reach a spring, in every meadow hear a song. But the falcon of the mystic heaven hath many a wondrous carol of the spirit in its breast, and the Persian bird keepeth in its soul many a sweet Arabian melody; yet these are hidden, and hidden shall remain. If I speak forth, many a mind will shatter, And if I write, many a pen will break.\n\nPeace be upon him who concludeth this exalted journey and followeth the way of truth by the lights of guidance.\n\nThe wayfarer, after traversing the high planes of this supernal journey, entereth into the City of Contentment. In this valley he feeleth the breezes of divine contentment blowing from the plane of the spirit. He burneth away the veils of want, and with inward and outward eye perceiveth within and without all things the day of \"God will satisfy everyone out of His abundance.\" From sorrow he turneth to bliss, and from grief to joy, and from anguish and dejection to delight and rapture.\n\nAlthough, to outward seeming, the wayfarers in this valley may dwell upon the dust, yet inwardly they are throned in the heights of mystic meaning; they partake of the eternal bounties of heaven and drink of the delicate wines of the spirit.\n\nThe tongue faileth in describing these three valleys, and speech falleth short. The pen steppeth not into this arena, the ink leaveth only a blot. In these stations, the nightingale of the heart hath other songs and secrets, which make the heart to leap and the soul to cry out, but this mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart, and confided only from breast to breast. The bliss of mystic knowers can be only told from heart to heart, A bliss no messenger can bear and no missive dare impart. How many are the matters I have out of weakness left unsaid; For my words would fail to reckon them and mine every effort would fall short.\n\nO friend, till thou enter the garden of these inner meanings, thou shalt never taste of the imperishable wine of this valley. And shouldst thou taste of it, thou wilt turn away from all else and drink of the cup of contentment; thou wilt loose thyself from all things and bind thyself unto Him, and lay down thy life in His path and offer up thy soul for His sake. And this, even though in this realm there is no \"all else\" that thou needst forget: \"God was alone; there was none else besides Him.\" For on this plane the traveller witnesseth the beauty of the Friend in all things. In fire he seeth the face of the Beloved; in illusion he beholdeth the secret of reality; in the attributes he readeth the riddle of the Essence. For he hath burnt away all veils with a sigh, and cast aside all coverings with a glance. With piercing sight he gazeth upon the new creation, and with lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities. The words \"And we have made thy sight sharp in this day\" are a sufficient proof of this assertion and a befitting description of this state.\n\nAfter journeying through the planes of pure contentment, the traveller cometh to the Valley of Wonderment and is tossed upon the oceans of grandeur, and at every moment his wonder increaseth. Now he seeth the embodiment of wealth as poverty itself, and the essence of independence as sheer impotence. Now is he struck dumb with the beauty of the All-Glorious; again is he wearied out with his own life. How many a mystic tree hath this whirlwind of bewilderment snatched by the roots, how many a soul hath it worn out and exhausted. For in this valley the traveller is flung into confusion, albeit, in the eyes of him who hath attained, such signs are esteemed and well beloved. At every moment, he beholdeth a wondrous world and a new creation, and goeth from astonishment to astonishment, and is lost in awe before the new handiwork of Him Who is the sovereign Lord of all.\n\nIndeed, O brother, if we ponder each created thing, we shall witness a myriad consummate wisdoms and learn a myriad new and wondrous truths. One of the created phenomena is the dream. Behold how many secrets have been deposited therein, how many wisdoms treasured up, how many worlds concealed. Observe how thou art asleep in a dwelling, and its doors are shut; on a sudden thou findest thyself in a far-off city, which thou enterest without moving thy feet or wearying thy body. Without taxing thine eyes, thou seest; without troubling thine ears, thou hearest; without a tongue, thou speakest. And perchance when ten years have passed, thou wilt witness in this temporal world the very things thou hast dreamt tonight.\n\nNow there are many wisdoms to ponder in the dream, which none but the people of this valley can comprehend in their reality. First, what is this world where without eye or ear or hand or tongue one can put all these to use? Second, how is it that in the outer world thou seest today the effect of a dream which thou didst witness in the world of sleep some ten years past? Consider the difference between these two worlds, and the mysteries they conceal, that, attended by divine confirmations, thou mayest attain unto heavenly discoveries and enter the realms of holiness.\n\nGod, the Most High, hath placed these signs in men so that veiled minds might not deny the mysteries of the life beyond, nor belittle that which hath been promised them. For some hold fast to reason and deny whatever reason comprehendeth not, and yet feeble minds can never grasp the reality of the stages that we have related: The universal divine Intellect alone can comprehend them. How can feeble reason embrace the Qur'an Or the spider snare a phoenix in its web?\n\nAll these states are to be found and witnessed in the Valley of Wonderment, wherein the wayfarer at every moment seeketh for more and is not wearied. Thus the Lord of the first and the last, in setting forth the grades of contemplation and expressing bewilderment, hath said: \"Increase my wonder and amazement at Thee, O God!\"\n\nLikewise, reflect upon the perfection of man's creation, and that all these planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him. Dost thou deem thyself a small and puny form, When thou foldest within thyself the greater world?\n\nWe must therefore labour to destroy the animal condition, till the meaning of humanity cometh to light.\n\nLikewise, Luqman, who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted of the waters of mercy, in proving to his son Nathan the planes of resurrection and death, advanced the dream as evidence and example. We relate it here, that through this evanescent Servant a memory may endure of that youth of the school of Divine Unity, that elder of the realms of instruction and detachment. He said: \"O son, if thou art able not to sleep, then thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to waken after sleep, then thou shalt be able not to rise after death.\"\n\nO friend, the heart is the dwelling-place of eternal mysteries: Make it not the home of fleeting fancies. Waste not the treasure of thy precious life occupied with this swiftly passing world. Thou comest from the world of holiness: Bind not thine heart to the earth. Thou art a dweller in the court of reunion: Choose not the homeland of the dust.\n\nIn sum, there is no end to the description of these stages, but because of the wrongs inflicted by the peoples of this age, this Servant is disinclined to continue: The tale remaineth yet unfinished and untold; Forgive me, then, for weariness hath taken hold. The pen groaneth and the ink sheddeth tears, and the river of the heart surgeth in waves of blood. \"Nothing can befall us but what God hath destined for us.\" Peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance!\n\nAfter scaling the high summits of wonderment, the wayfarer cometh to the Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness. This station is that of dying to the self and living in God, of being poor in self and rich in the Desired One. Poverty, as here referred to, signifieth being poor in that which pertaineth to the world of creation and rich in what belongeth to the realms of God. For when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth the presence of the Beloved, the radiant beauty of the Loved One and the fire of the lover's heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils and wrappings. Yea, all that he hath, from marrow to skin, will be set aflame, so that nothing will remain save the Friend.\n\nWhen once shone forth the attributes\n\nOf Him Who is the ancient King,\n\nAll mention Moses burned away\n\nOf every fleeting, transient thing.\n\nWhoso hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world. Wherefore, if those who have reached the ocean of His presence are found to possess none of the limited things of this perishable world, whether earthly riches or worldly opinions, it mattereth not. For that which is with His creatures is circumscribed by their own limitations, whereas that which is with God is sanctified therefrom. This utterance must be deeply pondered, that its purport may be clear. \"Verily the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered at the camphor fountain.\" If the true meaning of \"camphor\" become known, our true intent will become evident.\n\nThis station is that poverty of which it is said, \"Poverty is My glory.\" And of inward and outward poverty there is many a stage and many a meaning which I have not thought pertinent to mention here; hence I have reserved these for another time, dependent on what God may desire and fate may seal.\n\nThis is the station wherein the multiplicity of all things perisheth in the wayfarer; and the divine Countenance, dawning above the horizon of eternity, riseth out of the darkness; and the meaning of \"All on the earth shall pass away, but the face of thy Lord\" is made manifest.\n\nIn this case the text is already in English, so no translation is needed. The text appears to be from Baha'u'llah's Seven Valleys or related mystical writings.\n\nIn all these journeys the wayfarer must stray not a hair's breadth from the Law, for this is indeed the secret of the Path and the fruit of the Tree of Truth. And in all these stages he must cling to the robe of obedience to all that hath been enjoined, and hold fast to the cord of shunning all that is forbidden, that he may partake of the cup of the Law and be informed of the mysteries of Truth.\n\nIf any of the utterances of this Servant be not understood, or lead to perplexity, the same must be enquired of again, that no doubt may linger, and that the meaning may shine as resplendent as the face of the Beloved dawning from His \"Glorious Station\".\n\nThese journeys have no visible ending in this temporal world, but the detached wayfarer--should invisible confirmation descend upon him and the Guardian of the Cause assist him--may traverse these seven stages in seven steps, nay rather in seven breaths, nay even in a single breath, should God will and desire it. This is \"a token of His grace vouchsafed unto whomsoever He pleaseth.\"\n\nThey who soar in the heaven of Divine Unity and attain the depths of the sea of detachment reckon this city--which is the station of life in God--as the loftiest state of the mystic knowers and the furthermost homeland of the faithful lovers. But to this evanescent One of the mystic ocean, this station is the first gate of the heart's citadel, that is, man's first entrance to the city of the heart; and the heart is endowed with four stages, which would be recounted should a kindred soul be found. Shattered was the pen at once, Rent and torn in twain the page, When the pen did reach the point Of depicting such a stage.\n\nO My friend! Many a hound hunteth this gazelle of the desert of oneness; many an eagle pursueth this nightingale of the garden of eternity. Ravens of hatred lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of God, and the huntsman of envy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love.\n\nO Shaykh! Make of thine effort a glass, that perchance it may shelter this flame from contrary winds, albeit this flame doth long to be kindled in the lamp of the Lord and to shine in the niche of the spirit. For the head that is raised up in the love of God will assuredly fall by the sword, and the life that is aflame with longing will assuredly be extinguished, and the heart that cleaveth to the remembrance of the Beloved will assuredly break. How well hath it been said:\n\nLive free of love, for its peace\n\nIs grief and sorrow at each breath.\n\nIt starteth but with ache and pain;\n\nIt endeth but with loss and death.\n\nPeace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance!\n\nThe novel thoughts thou hast expressed as to the symbolism contained in the word \"sparrow\" were considered. Thou appearest to be well grounded in mystic truth. However, in each realm, to every letter a meaning is allotted which pertaineth to that realm. Indeed, the wayfarer findeth a secret in every name and a mystery in every letter. In one sense, these letters refer to the states of holiness. The first meaneth \"Free thyself from the promptings of self, then approach thy Lord.\" The second meaneth \"Purify thyself from all save Him, that thou mayest offer up thy life for His sake.\" The third meaneth \"Draw back from the threshold of the one true God if thou art still possessed of earthly attributes.\" The fourth meaneth \"Render thanks unto thy Lord on His earth, that He may bless thee in His heaven, albeit in the realm of His unity His heaven is the same as His earth.\" The fifth meaneth \"Remove from thine eyes the veils of limitation, that thou mayest learn that which thou knewest not of the stations of holiness.\" Wert thou to hearken unto the melodies of this mortal Bird, then wouldst thou seek out the eternal and undying chalice and renounce every fleeting and perishable cup. Peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance!\n\n=== END BH00047 ===\n\n=== START BH00048 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be to God Who hath manifested from the letter Alif the Most Great Steadfastness, and through the letter Ba the distinction between all things, and through the letter Jim revealed the station of him who circumambulated the Throne at eventide and at dawn, and through the letter Dal the submissiveness of God's loved ones in the Kingdom of Names and their humility and their bowing down when the lights were shed forth from the Luminary of their Lord's Will, the Lord of the Beginning and the Return. He made the letter Ha the essence of the temple of letters in the Most Exalted Word. When it was adorned with the letter Ba, there was manifested the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery and the Most Great Name whereby the world was adorned. Glorified be He Who hath revealed Himself by His Own Self unto His Own Self, and hath manifested Himself unto His creation through His signs, His revelations and His evidences. Glorified be He Who hath made all things to speak of the letters of the Book and hath revealed the mysteries of the Beginning in the Return. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Bestower. Glorified be the Lord of creation Who was named in the Gospel as the Spirit of Truth, and in the Torah as the Everlasting God, and in the Furqan as the Great Announcement, through Whom this Ancient Structure was raised up. Verily it was preceded by the Cause, which is God's compelling Will. I pray, offer salutations and glorification upon God's chosen ones, His pure ones, His loved ones and His emissaries, whom God hath purified from their own desires and made them the manifestations of His Will amidst all creation. These are servants through whom the horizon of the heaven of trustworthiness was illumined.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou by Whose Name the near ones have called out in the wilderness of longing and the sincere ones in the desert of separation. The sweetness of Thy call, which was raised from the direction of Thy Throne in Thy days, hath so transported them that they were drawn to Thee and said: \"Here am I, O Lord, here am I! Here am I, O Lord of the world and the Desire of the nations! Here am I, O Most Great Name and Most Ancient Spirit! Here am I, here am I, O Thou through Whose Name the sealed choice Wine was unsealed and the Self-Subsisting Name was manifested, and through Whom the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrance of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was wafted! Here am I, here am I, O God of existence and Ultimate Goal! Here am I, here am I, O Thou through Whose Name flowed the river of mercy and the Temple of Oneness was established upon the throne of grandeur! Here am I, here am I, O Thou through Whom the Fire spoke in the Tree and the earth shone with the light of Thy countenance! O Thou through Whom the Resurrection arose and the Hour was manifested and decayed bones were quickened! Here am I, here am I, O Goal of the mystics and Ultimate Hope of the yearning ones! Here am I, here am I, O Thou through Whose love the hearts of lovers were melted and through the light of Whose Cause the horizons were illumined!\" I praise Thee for having honored Thy dwellings with Thy presence and pitched Thy tents upon the hills and mountains by Thy Name and Thy power. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the sweetness of Thy utterance and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued Thy names, to aid Thy servants to turn unto the lights of Thy countenance and to advance toward Thy horizon. O Lord! Keep them not back from the shore of the ocean of Thy bounty, nor deprive them of the table Thou hast sent down from the clouds of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy grace. Then make known to them that which shall profit them in every world of Thy worlds. Thou, verily, art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nAnd furthermore, letters of that honored one have been received wherein every word eloquently utters mention of the Beloved of all possibility, illuminating the realm of the heart and adorning and gladdening the climate of love. How excellent is what was said! How sweet that fragrance when its perfume was diffused in the name of the peerless Friend and its sweet scents were spread abroad! When I found and recognized it, I turned toward the countenance of our Lord, the Master of all creation, and drew near until I reached the Most Exalted Horizon. When I attained His presence, I presented that which the nightingale of your love had warbled upon the branches and the dove of your affection had cooed among the twigs. When this was completed, the Lord of the throne above and the earth below, the Master of the latter and former worlds, spoke that which caused all created things to be attracted. His word, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nIn My Name, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing\n\nThis is a mention from Us to him who hath turned unto God, the Lord of all worlds, who heard the Call and hastened to the Most Glorious Horizon and drank the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. From him was diffused such a fragrance of the love of God that the Most Exalted Pen hath borne witness to him in this lofty Castle which was built before the Manifestation and raised up when the Ancient Beauty arrived at the Most Great Prison. Thus doth the Pen recount from the presence of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Abu'l-Fadl! The Dayspring of Justice maketh mention of thee with verses from which the near ones perceive the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Great. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We have created the world for this Day, which was mentioned by the tongue of My chosen ones and inscribed by the Pen of My will in My perspicuous Book. The All-Merciful hath come and the proof hath appeared in such wise that none can deny it save every aggressive transgressor. The favor hath been completed, the proof perfected, and the heavenly table hath descended from the heaven of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. Behold the servants and what they have wrought in the days of their Lord. They have broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and have denied Him in Whom they believed and Whom they invoked at morn and eve. Thus have their souls beguiled them in that they followed the daysprings of idle fancies. Blessed is the powerful one whom the might of the world hath not weakened, and the stranger who hath sought the Most Exalted Homeland and witnessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in the beginning and the end. How many a prince hath turned away from the Truth and how many a poor one hath drawn nigh and said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Desire of hearts, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Master of creation!\" How many a learned one hath been prevented by his learning from My Self-Subsisting Name, and how many an ignorant one hath heard and responded to his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Blessed is he who hath beheld the Most Great Sign, and he who hath heard the Call of God, the Lord of Lords. Arise to serve the Cause in the name of thy Lord and give the people the glad-tidings of this Manifestation at Whose appearance all names have bowed down and all things have cried out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Compelling!\" Say: O concourse of religions! By what proof did ye believe in God aforetime, and by what evidence do ye turn away from Him by Whom the Temple of Pre-existence was established upon the Most Great Throne and the Revealer of Utterance did speak? By God! That which adorneth the mention of the Scriptures and Tablets hath appeared. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them down through Our grace, and I am verily the Powerful over what I will. There is no God but Me, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nO Fadl! The deeds of nations have become the cause of the world's upheaval and the afflictions that have befallen it. Observe how years pass, yet the world finds neither peace nor tranquility. Each day its people are afflicted with new trials, yet remain heedless and veiled from their cause. The sweet and gentle ocean appears before their faces, yet in their heedlessness and ignorance they pass it by, turning instead to the mirage. Their vain imaginings, which neither nourish nor satisfy, have deprived them of the effulgent rays of the Sun of Certitude; they have forsaken true knowledge and clung to evident ignorance.\n\nConvey My greetings to the faithful ones in that land and say: Today is the day of pure deeds and service. All that hath befallen you in the path of God hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book. God willing, may ye remain firm and steadfast in this Most Great Cause amidst the peoples in such wise that the cawing of Satan shall not debar you from the choice wine of the All-Merciful. Beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist you in preserving that which He hath bestowed. I swear by the Sun of Justice shining from the horizon of the heaven of grace that the stations of those possessed of certitude are, in the sight of God, exceedingly glorious--so much so that they transcend the reckoning of those possessed of computation and the pen. Ye are the arks of God's bounty for the peoples of the world and His most firm cord for all nations. Know ye and understand your worth and station. This is a Day wherein man can cause to grow a tree whose fruits shall endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. O Fadl! The Wronged One sends His greetings to thee and to them and to those who have not violated God's Covenant and His Testament.\n\nThis evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, with heart and tongue to assist His loved ones, His chosen ones, and His friends to preserve what they have witnessed and heard in His path. The friends have purchased with their lives the love of the Beloved of all worlds. They must not let this supreme bounty and mighty gift slip from their grasp through the vain imaginings of this or that one. Every precious thing has its thief in pursuit and its betrayer in ambush. All must be vigilant lest thieves find opportunity and proceed to plunder. This evanescent servant is ever engaged in remembering the friends of God--mentioning them with the pen, seeking their protection with the heart, and occupied with both through speech. Verily we are God's and to Him do we return.\n\nMention was made of his honor Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God. The details concerning him and the account of his circumstances, as heard from the scratching of your pen, attained the honor of being submitted before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and there was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful's grace concerning him a Tablet which, in truth, crieth out between the heavens and the earth and summoneth him for whom it was revealed. This servant beseecheth God, his Lord, to grant him the sweetness of His utterance and to make him one of those who are firm, steadfast, and secure. Should one observe with the eye of insight, he would testify that the entire world cannot equal this most holy, most exalted Tablet that hath been sent down from the heaven of pure grace. In each word is concealed the wellspring of bounty, and in each utterance surgeth the ocean of meaning. May the spirit of all else but Him be a sacrifice for His grace.\n\nAs to your mention of Mirza Muhammad Husayn Khan, upon him be the Glory of God - his remembrance has been and continues to be in the Most Holy Presence, and all that you wrote was presented before the Most Exalted, Most Holy Presence. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke words which this servant, nay all the peoples of the world, are powerless and incapable of describing. Blessed is he through whose name flowed the river of mercy, and unto whom descended the true heavenly table in the form of letters and words that all the treasures of earth and heaven cannot equal. Previously also, a Tablet specifically for him was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Goal of all the worlds and was sent forth. His portrait was repeatedly honored to attain the presence and was blessed with the bounty of meeting. Happy is he with the perpetuity of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. Would that the people of the world had pondered upon that which hath appeared and partaken of the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful. That which their hands have wrought in the past hath prevented them - to this beareth witness He with Whom is the knowledge of the past and future, and every wise command. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnd thy second letter, dated the seventh of Jumada'th-Thani, illumined the world of separation with the star of nearness and attainment. Blessed is the messenger from whom the fragrance of nearness can be inhaled, and blessed is the bearer from whom the sweet-scented breeze of meeting emanates. And the Seven Oft-Repeated Verses, for which there hath been and is no second, inasmuch as they were adorned with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds and were sanctified from the doubts, misgivings and suspicions of the people of creation. After its perusal, reading and becoming acquainted with its contents, it was taken to the Most Exalted Horizon, and after full permission was presented before the Presence. His word, exalted and mighty is He:\n\nHe is the Near One, the Answerer\n\nO thou who hast turned toward My horizon! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily, it hath turned toward thee and speaketh in remembrance of thee, that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause and utter that which the Tongue of My Grandeur hath uttered before the creation of My heaven and My earth: \"Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower.\" The servant who is present hath appeared and presented before the Wronged One that which thou didst commune with God, the Lord of the Final End. Blessed is thy tongue for having uttered My remembrance, and thy face for having turned toward My face, and thy heart for having turned toward My station, which God hath made the point of adoration for the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise in the evening and at dawn.\n\nO Abul-Fadl! We have heard thy call and answered thee before, and at this time. Be thou grateful and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things!\" O Abul-Fadl! Arise in My Name and proclaim with wisdom and utterance: \"O people of creation! Come ye, that I may recount unto you the Most Great News, through whose mention the Sacred Books and Tablets have been adorned. Come, O people of the earth, that I may show you the Most Exalted Horizon and cause you to hear the Call of God, the Lord of Lords. O concourse of the heedless! Bring forth what ye possess. By the life of God! It shall not profit you on this Day, wherein the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen and its sweetest call have been raised from the horizon of glory. Fear ye God, O people, and deny not the Sun after its dawning, nor the Most Great Ocean which hath appeared before your faces with majesty and waves. Say: O daysprings of idle fancies! By God, the Truth! The dawning-places of certitude lament because of your tyranny. Fear ye God, and follow not every ignorant doubter.\" Thus have We remembered thee and revealed unto thee that which rejoiceth thy heart and the hearts of them who have clung to the hem of the robe of their Lord's mercy, the Master of the Day of Judgment. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon them who have testified to that whereunto God testified when He was established upon the throne at the beginning of days.\n\nThe supplications of that eminent one which were contained in the first and second letters were presented at the Most Holy Court, whereupon the Sun of loving-kindness shone forth in such wise that this servant is truly incapable and powerless to make mention thereof. The verses sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful's mercy are themselves a fair witness. Blessed is the eye that beholdeth them and the ear that heareth them.\n\nThe spiritual ode of Jinab-i-Thurayya, upon him be the Glory of God, which opened with that hallowed name, was presented at an appropriate time. Thus spoke He Who conversed on Sinai: \"Verily his mention, description and praise have been accepted and adorned with the mantle of acceptance.\" Praised be God that it was adorned with the supreme embellishment of acceptance and was blessed with the effulgences of the Sun of favor. Regarding what was written in the margin concerning two verses suggesting that in these days some learned ones had claimed they too could produce verses like the wondrous verses that are proof of the Author of this new Cause - the response given by that honored one is itself a decisive proof and manifest evidence of the truth of the Truth, exalted be His glory. For in the time of every Revelation, the polytheists of that age, namely the divines, have uttered such vain and worthless words. This is not the first utterance to appear in opposition. Were one to ponder the words of the polytheists of the past, he would testify to what the servant has testified before God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nApart from this, consider how devoid of fairness, reason and knowledge they are. One who was never known for learning, was not from among the seminary students, and in his early days earned his livelihood through ordinary worldly means - as all have testified and continue to testify to this fact - yet suddenly oceans of knowledge in the form of verses began to flow from him. How can one deny this or claim there is anything similar to it? Verses like rain, nay greater, are continually streaming down and descending, encompassing the world. Blessed is he who has a tongue, an eye, and an ear to speak the truth and judge with justice concerning that which has appeared from God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nThe world's ears are filled with divine verses, yet very few fair-minded ones are to be found. If a fair-minded person were to gaze upon the revealed tablets with clear vision and an unburdened heart, and reflect upon what was foretold before, he would place his right cheek upon the dust and say: \"I have believed, O Lord of Lords! I testify that all else is as nothingness before the manifestations of Thy Revelation and non-existent before the signs of Thy Cause. I testify that by Thy Name the sea was stirred, the fragrance was wafted, and the banner of 'There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed' was raised. All things are captive in the grasp of Thy power, and verily Thou art the Almighty, the Omnipotent.\"\n\nThe people are heedless; they know not what has appeared. All scribes are utterly powerless and incapable of recording the verses at the time of their revelation. Whatever this evanescent one has submitted and continues to submit is according to his own capacity and station. By the King of Eternity! The Truth is sanctified, exalted and purified above what I have submitted or may submit.\n\nThe mention of the receptive souls referenced in your letter was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. For each one specifically, manifest signs and brilliant evidences have been revealed and have shone forth from the heaven of grace. This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Khudadad, upon him be the Glory of God. His word, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn My Name, the One Who dominates over what was and what will be \\[...\\]\n\nO Khudadad! Fix thy gaze upon this Word which is as a crown upon the head of utterance - be thou observant of that whereby My Cause will be exalted amongst My servants. Though this Word be brief, yet concealed within it is the limitless ocean. Some time ago, unique and sublime verses were sent down specifically for the friends in the land of Kha, and likewise some were dispatched particularly for thee, while others remain suspended in the heaven of God's Will. God willing, thou shalt in all conditions hold fast unto the cord of His Cause and cling to the hem of wisdom. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve and is occupied with teaching God's Cause. Rejoice thou in what My Most Exalted Pen hath testified to thy humility and lowliness, thy turning and devotion unto God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis is what was revealed for Shahverdi, upon him be the glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, the Wronged One\n\nO Shah! Give thanks that We have acquainted thee with what was hidden in God's knowledge and given thee to drink of that which flowed from the right hand of the Throne, and shown thee Mine illumined horizon. We created the world for this Day, yet when it appeared, every heedless and remote soul denied it. The trumpet hath been sounded and those in the graves have arisen, yet the people remain behind a thick veil. Rejoice thou in the Most Great Remembrance and render thanks unto thy Lord for this supreme bounty. Whoso hath attained unto My remembrance is assuredly of the people of Paradise in a clear Book. Preserve what hath been revealed unto thee before and after, then recite it unto the myriads who have been attracted by My call, who have soared in My atmosphere and who have spoken My beauteous praise. Thus hath the horizon of proof been illumined by the Sun of knowledge. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh, and woe unto the heedless. From this station do We send Our greetings upon thee and upon My friends and loved ones whom the powers of the oppressors have not deterred from My straight Path.\n\nThis is what was revealed from the Most Great Scene for Ali-Qabli-Asghar:\n\nIn My Name, the Most Great\n\nO Ali-Qabli-Asghar! In numerous Tablets thou hast been mentioned by the Lord of Names. By the Lord of all being! Not all the precious jewels of the earth can equal a single word thereof. Reflect upon the oceans of the mercy and bounty of God, exalted be His glory. Despite having mentioned thee repeatedly, now when thy name was heard in the Book of those who love Me, an answer was sent down from the heaven of grace that thou mightest be of the thankful ones. Though discerning souls are rare at present, yet a time shall come when the station of every word and letter of God's utterances shall become manifest to all the worlds. God willing, thou shalt remain firm and steadfast on the straight path with clear certitude, speaking the praise of the Wronged One. Soon shall the mention of steadfast souls and what they have manifested in the days of God be spread abroad in the assemblage of the world. This is the word that is assured and shall never change. We convey Our greetings to the friends of that land and remind them of what hath been revealed in the Tablets, that all may at all times drink from the life-giving waters flowing from the Pen of the All-Merciful and attain unto that which is everlasting and enduring. Blessed are they that have attained. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThis is what was revealed for Mashhadi Husayn from the people of Q:\n\nVerily I am the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Husayn! The Wronged One makes mention of thee with that which shall draw thee nearer unto God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Forsake all things and take hold of that which thou art commanded by God, Creator of heaven. Thus have We bidden Our servants aforetime and in a Book that proclaims that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed is the eye which no film of vain imaginings hath prevented from turning unto and beholding the horizon of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: Through Him the horizons were illumined and the decree of the Covenant was revealed, yet most men perceive not. They have cast away that which is known and clung to that which is forbidden. Thus doth the Lord of Destiny inform you from the precincts of the Prison, did ye but know. We have endowed the Cause with two wings, which are unity and love. Soar with them in this holy and blessed atmosphere. Thus did the ocean surge when My Pen moved in this glorious station. The glory be upon thee and upon thy son, whose name hath been honored by the hearing of the Lord of the visible and invisible.\n\nBy your life, O beloved of My heart! The essence of grace hath prostrated itself before my Lord and thy Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earth, and the reality of bounty hath bowed down at the revelation of a wave from the waves of the ocean of the bounty of our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of the sincere ones.\n\nAs for the names mentioned in your letters, unique and exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of God's Will for each one. God willing, may all attain and drink from their oceans of inner meanings. This Day is exceedingly great and mighty. Although the Lamp of the Cause standeth firm amidst diverse and violent winds, yet at one time this blessed word was uttered from the tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory: \"O servant in attendance! Even lamps possessing but a single wick proved impossible for all on earth to extinguish. How then could they extinguish this blazing Fire which, were all the seas of the world poured upon it, would be transformed into oil?\" Beseech God not to withhold His servants from the ocean of awareness and to guide them to the horizon of vision. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nGod is My witness that this evanescent one observeth himself at all times as a melting candle, for he beholdeth the people heedless of the Sun of Truth whose rays have encompassed the world. By the life of the Desired One! My liver is melted, my heart lamenteth, and my inner being crieth out at what hath befallen the Cause at the hands of those who know not their right hand from their left, nor can distinguish between black and white, nor between buzzing and thundering. The servant beseecheth his Lord to grant them fairness and draw them near unto Him through the wonders of His grace and bounty. Verily, He is the Generous, the Munificent.\n\nAlthough most of the people of the world of every kind are today observed to be deprived of proof and barred from the divine path, yet this servant is grateful to the exalted Truth, for from all your being blazeth the fire of divine love, and the words and letters that have flowed from your pen bear witness to what hath been mentioned. I truly declare that from every word and letter are manifested the effects of burning in divine love, the signs of the fire of separation and remoteness, and the degrees of yearning for the Lord of the Covenant. If some grief should appear due to the heedlessness of the people, praise be to God, the joy of your awareness hath compensated for it. God willing, may you ever soar and wing your flight in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful with the pinions of steadfastness. The Cause is in His grasp; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nIn regard to what you wrote concerning the friends of God from Abhar, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and these sublime words descended from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Creation, blessed and exalted be His utterance:\n\nIn My Name, the Witness, the All-Informed\n\nO thou who hast turned thy face toward My horizon! By My life! It hath at times been observed that His loved ones have been and are capable of bearing afflictions in the path of the Lord of Names. The extended necks of the swine have not been and are not worthy of the chains of love for the Beloved of the worlds. The people of devotion prefer the chalice of tribulation in the path of God, exalted be His glory, above all things. I swear by the lights of the Divine Countenance that all the tribulations that have been visited upon them shall soon be transformed into the Most Great Gift, the Supreme Blessing, and a Feast the like of which cannot be found. Blessed are they who have been honored with the blessed words \"ye are of Us.\" The ears of the loved ones have been privileged to hear that which the ears of the world, in times past and still more remote, were deprived of; likewise their eyes. Exalted is the All-Choosing One, through Whose manifestation that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath appeared and been established.\n\nThe might of the transgressors, the rebellion of the oppressors, and the fire of the mischief-makers shall soon be seen extinguished, vanquished and subdued. These fleeting days appear shorter than an hour and pass more swiftly than lightning. We beseech God to assist all to accomplish that which His Book hath proclaimed, for should they act in accordance with what God hath willed, they would find the earth transformed. In any case, the victory hath ever been and shall remain with God and His loved ones, despite those who have disbelieved in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO people of Abhar! The Wronged One remembereth you from the Most Great Prison with verses from which every person of perception can detect the fragrance of My loving-kindness, and I am the Kind, the Generous. Tongues and pens have failed to reckon what hath been revealed by the Most Exalted Pen, and I am the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance, which no remembrance in the world can equal. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity, and I am the All-Seeing Witness. Ye have heard what caused the Concourse on High to lament in My path. Hearken now unto that wherewith God remembereth you, and I am the Remembering, the All-Hearing. Verily, He hath witnessed what befell you and was with you under all conditions. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nThere hath befallen Us in the Land of ?a \\[Tehran\\] what hath befallen no one before. Thus hath the matter been decreed, and We are among the patient ones. Blessed is he who was among you and uttered that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in the earliest days: \"Verily, there is no God but I, the Most High, the Most Great.\" We adorned him with the ornament of divine knowledge, illumined him with the lights of the Divine Countenance, gave him to drink of the Kawthar of grace, and guided him to My straight path.\n\nO Abhar! Rejoice thou, for God hath manifested from thee servants who arose and said: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth.\" We have adorned thee with them, and We shall soon make manifest their stations and their traces within thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Bearer of Glad-Tidings, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who was seized in My path, imprisoned for My Name, and martyred for the promotion of the Cause of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nWe counsel you, O loved ones of God, to observe wisdom and that whereby this firm, this mighty Cause may be exalted. The glory that hath shone forth from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon those who have soared in My atmosphere, and upon those who arose after them to make mention of Me, and upon you, and upon My handmaidens who have heard, turned toward Me, and believed in God when every learned one turned away and every mystic was filled with doubt.\n\nPraise be to God that through that honored one, mention was made before the Most Great Scene of a number of the friends of God, exalted be His glory, and there was revealed especially for them that which shall never be exhausted and which the dust of the world shall not prevent from its delicacy and radiance. I convey greetings and salutations to Master Ali-Akbar Haddad, upon him be the Glory of God, and I give him and other oppressed ones glad-tidings of God's grace. God willing, may the hand of divine favor protect them and the hand of divine might seize their enemies. By the life of the Desired One! Soon all that hath been mentioned shall become manifest and evident.\n\nThe mention which that honored one made regarding the Master, as well as the conversation with him, was presented at the Most Holy Court. The utterances of that honored one were honored with acceptance. He spoke, and His Word is the truth: \"Excellent is that which Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be My Glory, hath spoken.\" And these supreme words were again revealed from the right hand of the Throne especially for the Master: \"Blessed is he, then blessed is he, for he hath repeatedly been honored with the mention of God, and happy is he for having drunk from the cup of tribulation in the path of the Lord of Names, and pleasant it is for him that he now drinketh the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the All-Merciful's bounty.\"\n\nHis words, blessed and exalted be He: \"In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! O Ali before Akbar! My Pen testifieth in My days that thou hast turned to My most exalted horizon when thou didst hear My sweetest call, and there befell thee in My path what befell My chosen ones and My loved ones in the ancient centuries and in this wondrous Day.\" End quote.\n\nThis testimony that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen removeth the grief of a world of sorrow, rendeth asunder the veils of cares and anxieties, and leadeth to the greatest joy. Again doth the servant wish to say: \"Happy is he and pleasant it is for him.\"\n\nJinab-i-Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, had also mentioned him some time ago. Every oppressed one should read what hath been revealed for them from the heaven of the All-Merciful. The heedlessness of the oppressors hath reached such a degree that they curse themselves without being aware. Whenever mention is made of former oppressors, they dissociate themselves and express sorrow, unaware that they themselves are committing what is greater than what hath passed. The veils of self have prevented their eyes from seeing and deprived their ears of hearing. All the people of the world are seen as chaff before the violent winds of selfish desires - they move them howsoever they wish, save whom God willeth. They have clung to and relied upon a world that at all times loudly testifieth to its own transiency, nothingness, and unfaithfulness, while turning their eyes away from God's infinite, everlasting worlds. Soon shall they find themselves in regret and remorse, but neither regret nor remorse shall profit them.\n\nAnd as for the mention thou didst make of Muhammad-Ali Khan, Mulla Ali, and Aqa Shir-Ali, upon them be the Glory of God - mention of each one was honored to be heard by the Lord of Names, and divine verses were revealed concerning them. God willing, may they taste the honey of recognition from the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds and manifest the greatest steadfastness among all peoples. This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to each one. God willing, may all partake of the heavenly feast in the divine days and become occupied with the mention of the true Sovereign.\n\nO Abul-Fadl! Thou hast spoken the truth and revealed that which lay concealed in His words. The purpose of the Herald, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - in mentioning this matter was to rend asunder the veils of people's vain imaginings. Thou art well aware of what the heedless Shi'ihs have uttered in this regard. At times they have, with the hands of idle fancy, built a Holy Place, and at other times mention of the tunnel and the sea hath flowed from the tongues of their liars, and the mention of Jabulqa and Jabulsa and other matters is clear and evident. All are mounted upon the steed of passion and are rushing about in the desert of doubts and vain imaginings. His Holiness intended that through this mention He might, to some degree, rend asunder the veil, that they might come to know that that Holy Being and Sacred Essence was to appear from physical descent, not in imaginary fabricated cities, for at the beginning of the Cause the people had no capacity to hearken to more than this, and outwardly what He revealed was in conformity with their understanding. That which hath flowed from His Supreme Pen testifieth that He Himself proclaimeth betwixt earth and heaven: \"I am the Mother of Utterance amidst mankind, and the Truth manifest among all created things, and the Expression of the All-Merciful in the contingent world.\" Exalted is He Who mentioneth Him and Who maketh mention of Him at this time. The created things have borne witness unto that which He hath testified. Command belongeth unto God, the Revealer of verses.\n\nPraise be to God! That which hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to that which ye have deduced from the aforementioned passage. God willing, may ye ever drink from the chalice of inner meanings and guide the peoples of the contingent world to the horizon of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. The Cause is most evident, yet eyes are veiled and ears are stopped. From the beginning of creation until this time no Cause hath been more manifest than this. All divine Books, Scriptures and Psalms, both of the past and present, have outwardly testified and borne witness to this Most Great Cause, even as that spiritual friend hath mentioned certain verses and removed the veil from the face of clear evidences.\n\nReflect upon the passage \"and ye shall surely know its tidings after a while.\" This blessed verse was mentioned by the late Siyyid, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and likewise by the Shaykh before him, upon him be every most glorious glory, and also by the Primal Point, may the spirit of all in the Kingdom be sacrificed for His sake. All have related it to this Revelation, for after the fulfillment of the promise of sixty-eight, in the year nine, this Most Great, Most Wondrous Cause dawned from the horizon of the Will of the Lord of all beings. This is why the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said: \"In the year nine ye shall attain unto all good,\" and in another place He saith: \"In the year nine ye shall be blessed with the meeting of God.\"\n\nWere this evanescent servant to mention all that hath been revealed in the Books of the past and present, as well as in the Bayan, he would need to impose upon you for a long time. Nevertheless, ye must surely have heard what a band of the heedless have said and continue to say. Would that they had reflected upon that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an where He, exalted be He, saith: \"And the trumpet shall be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth shall swoon away, save those whom God shall please to exempt. Then shall it be blown again, and lo! arising they shall gaze around them.\"\n\nThese simple folk have objected to the mention of divinity, whereas if anything else had been manifested they should have objected to that instead. The Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said: \"He Who speaketh in every condition, verily I am God, there is no God but Me, the Lord of all things, and all besides Me are My creation. O My creation! Worship ye Me.\"\n\nLikewise in the Qur'an there appear many decisive verses that openly indicate and suggest this matter, and in previous Books no mention other than this is to be found. This evanescent servant hath in certain instances cited some passages from the heavenly Books, but the blind hath no share in light, and the deaf no portion in the cooing of the dove of paradise. Praise be to God that ye are well-informed and have searched the heavenly Books. God willing, may ye ever be confirmed in mentioning that which shall cause the heedless to awaken, the seated to arise, and the loved ones to rejoice and be gladdened.\n\nThis evanescent one beseecheth you to convey greetings and praise to the friends in that land who are adorned with the ornament of tranquility and dignity and who are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and say unto them that this servant is at all times occupied with your remembrance and is engaged in serving the Most Great Cause, of which ye are all aware.\n\nSay: This servant is at all times engaged in your remembrance and is constant and vigilant in serving the Most Great Cause, of which ye all are aware. That which today is conducive to the manifestation of the essence of man is well-pleasing and acceptable before God. God willing, may ye be turned, in perfect unity and concord, love and fellowship, unto that whereby the Cause is exalted. In these days this exalted word was specially revealed from the Most Sublime Pen for one of the friends - blessed and exalted be His word: The world is illumined by the light of unity, and the horizons are set ablaze through the warmth of concord. For all things that are seen and perceived, and that enter the realm of observation, there hath been and continueth to be an effect. Likewise, the taste and fragrance of the effects of unity and concord are most mighty. God willing, may that honored one and the friends of God strive that scattered and distracted hearts may ascend to the heaven of unity, and through the hosts of deeds and character take possession of the cities of hearts. This host is mightier than the hosts of the world. Blessed is he who hath arisen for God to render this momentous service. He is assuredly among the sincere ones in the perspicuous Book. Happy the soul that hath found the sweetness of the divine utterance and hath arisen with steadfastness and love. Another request is that ye convey greetings to his honor, that peerless friend. God willing, may he in this transient world attain unto that which shall never be severed from the fragrance of eternity. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the Powerful. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Informed. That which today beseemeth and behooveth him is to take the lead and guide all Persians and draw them to the straight path. This wondrous, luminous garment is, God willing, befitting for his temple. Command and judgment are in God's hand. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nAs regards what you wrote concerning Aqa Muhammad-Rida, this evanescent servant had previously mentioned the details of this matter. Those souls here were and are outwardly well-known. Several years ago Jinab-i-Mirza Mahdi, son of Jinab-i-Shahid, upon them both be the Glory of God, had taken one of the honored women related to the Sacred Household in the land of K. The point is that the details concerning His Holiness the Martyr and Jinab-i-Dhabi?, upon them both be the Glory of God, and their brothers who were hesitant, and their sons, were outwardly clear and known. At one time a letter from the beloved of hearts Jinab-i-Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God, reached this servant mentioning Aqa Muhammad-Rida, and likewise before that he had been mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. After submission to the Most Holy Presence, out of pure grace their designation was changed from hesitant to soaring bird. They must know the station of this favor and preserve it as the apple of their eye. Their letter arrived and divine fragrances wafted from it. This servant wrote a reply, but due to the weight of the packet it will be sent subsequently. Likewise the accounts sent attained the honor of His presence and the details thereof are mentioned in the letter to that honored one that was revealed. God willing they will attain unto it. What this servant expects from that honored one is that today they should hold fast to that which will cause unity among the hearts of the friends of God, so that all people may testify to the light of unity and the loftiness of concord. That which causes the exaltation of the Word is this: according to the command of that Beloved One, they must exert mighty efforts in this regard. From the beginning of the Revelation until now this matter has repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen, yet its fragrance has not yet been inhaled. God willing they will succeed in accomplishing this mighty deed. Verily God and His Prophets and His Messengers and His chosen ones and the Supreme Concourse and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Most Glorious Kingdom send their blessings upon those who have arisen to create affection between the hearts of His servants and His loved ones. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous. As regards what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Farzanih, upon him be God's favor, his condition and what he possesses is known and clear, and what he has sent is witness and testimony. As for his questions, it was not expedient that they be mentioned one after another and answers be bestowed, as this would have been contrary and opposed to wisdom and what people possess. However, in what has been sent down from the heaven of grace specifically for him, answers have been mentioned with perfect brevity and conciseness which is miraculous. They apparently have not properly considered it, for if they had, they would have testified that not a single letter thereof was omitted and would have uttered \"this is naught but a clear and decisive utterance.\" Their questions were \\[...\\]\n\nFirst, the Great Prophets of Meh-Abad together with Zoroaster numbered twenty-eight, and each upheld and sustained the Faith and Religion of the other, none seeking to nullify what had come before. Each Bearer of Revelation that appeared bore witness to the truth and righteousness of the Laws and Religion that preceded them, and uttered no word to proclaim their abolition, saying: \"From God have we received this, and unto His servants do we deliver it.\" Several of the Hindu religious leaders have claimed: \"We are as God, and creation must abide by our command, and when discord and division appear among the created things, we shall come and remove it,\" and each that appeared declared: \"I am the same as was in the beginning.\" The latter Founders of Religion, such as David and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, proclaimed: \"The previous Prophets were true; in that time the Law was thus, and now it is as I pronounce.\" The Arabian Prophet declared: \"With my appearance all previous Laws are abrogated and the Law is only my Law.\" Of these groups, which do they prefer, and to which path do they accord precedence?\n\nFirstly, in one station the ranks of the Prophets differ from one another. For example, consider Moses Who was the Bearer of a Book and Laws, and many of the Prophets and Messengers who were sent after Him were commanded to carry out His Law, as these laws were not contrary to that time, as is clear and evident in the scriptures and books appended to the Torah. And as for what was mentioned that the Bearer of the Qur'an said at His appearance that \"all commandments and religions are false and My commandment alone is commandment\" - that Mine of Divine wisdom and Source of heavenly knowledge never uttered such words. Rather, He confirmed that which was sent down from the heaven of Divine Will upon the Prophets and Messengers, as He says, exalted be He: \"Alif. Lam. Mim. Allah! There is no God but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting. He has sent down to thee the Book in truth, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the Criterion.\" And He said that all came from God and return unto God. In this station they have all been one soul, for they spoke no message, word or command of their own accord, nor did they manifest anything except that which was from the True One, exalted be His glory. They all summoned mankind to the supreme horizon and gave glad tidings of eternal life. In this case, the diverse utterances of the questioner all return to unified letters, meaning to a single word. And as for what was written asking which of these groups they prefer and to which leaders they give precedence - in this station the sun of the blessed words \"We make no distinction between any of His Messengers\" rises and shines forth, while in another station there is the station of \"We have made some of these Messengers to excel others,\" as was mentioned before. All that the questioner has asked is concealed and hidden in this supreme, decisive, all-embracing Word. As He says, blessed and exalted be He: As to the question about the heavenly Books: The pulse of the world is in the hand of the skilled Physician. He sees the illness and wisely prescribes the remedy. Every day has its own secret and every head its own cry. The illness of today has one cure and tomorrow's another. Look ye to today and speak of today's needs. Thus does every fair-minded person testify that these words are considered among the mirrors of divine knowledge, and all that was asked appears and is reflected therein with utmost clarity and evidence. Blessed is he who is given insight from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnother question, O Unique One: There are four groups in the realm: One group says that all visible worlds, from the atom to the sun, are the Absolute Truth and nothing but Truth is visible. Another group says that the Essence of the Necessary Being is Truth, and the Prophets are intermediaries between God and creation, guiding creation toward Truth. Another group says that the celestial bodies are created by the Necessary Being, and all other things are entirely their effects and benefits, coming into existence and departing like a pond that fills with water wherein worms are generated, appear and disappear. Another group says that the Necessary Being created a nature from whose effects and benefits all things from atom to sun appear and disappear, having neither beginning nor end, without reckoning or account - like rain falling and plants growing and perishing, and other things similarly. The Prophets and kings who established laws and order did so for the organization of the realm and civil administration - the Prophets proceeding in one way and the kings in another. The Prophet said \"God has commanded\" so that people would be obedient and submissive; the kings dealt with people through cannon and sword. Among these four groups, which is acceptable to Truth?\n\nThe answer to all these points was in the first utterance which flowed from the Tongue of the All-Merciful. By the life of God, it encompasses and contains all that was mentioned, for He says: \"Look to this Day and speak of this Day, for today the Sovereign of Manifestation is manifest and the Speaker of the Mount is speaking. Whatever He commands is the firm foundation for the edifices of knowledge and wisdom of the worlds. Whosoever clings to Him is mentioned in the Most Sublime Vision as one endowed with vision.\" This exalted Word has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen - His Word, exalted and mighty be He: \"Today is the Day of vision, for the Countenance of God is manifest and evident from the horizon of manifestation. Today is the Day of hearing, for the Divine Call is raised. All must today cling to and speak of that which hath appeared from the Dayspring of the Books, the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Manifestation of Knowledge and the Source of divine wisdom.\" Thus it is clear and established that the answer to the question hath been sent down and made manifest from the Dayspring of the knowledge of the All-Merciful. Blessed are they that understand.\n\nAs for these four points that were mentioned, it is quite clear and evident that the second point is closer to righteousness, for the Prophets and Messengers have been the channels of divine grace, and whatsoever hath reached from God to His creation hath been through these sacred Temples, these abstract Gems, these Repositories of knowledge and Manifestations of His Cause. The other points can also be interpreted, for in one sense all things are manifestations of the names and attributes of God. As for what was written concerning kings, in truth they are the manifestations of the name \"the Mighty\" and the dawning-places of the name \"the Powerful\" of God, exalted be His glory. The garment that befitteth such august figures is justice - should they be adorned therewith, the people of the world would attain unto supreme tranquility and mighty blessing. Whosoever hath drunk even a drop from the choice wine of divine knowledge can explain the answer to such questions with clear and manifest proofs from the horizons and with evident and brilliant signs within the souls.\n\nAlthough today another matter is manifest and different discourse is befitting, for the time of questions and answers expired in the first nine of His Dispensation. Thus He says, exalted and mighty be His Word: \"This is not the Day of questions. When thou hearest the Call from the Dawning-Place of Grandeur, say: 'Here am I, O God of Names! Here am I, O Fashioner of the heavens! I testify that Thou hast manifested and revealed what Thou didst desire by Thy command. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.'\"\n\nAs for what that peerless one hath written, the answer to all is clear and evident. That which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine favor specifically for him is so that he might hear the sweet melodies of the Dove of Eternity and the songs of the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise, discover the sweetness of the Call, and walk in its effect. One day a word was heard from the blessed tongue concerning him which indicates that at some time he will be enabled to accomplish that which shall be adorned with the ornament of eternity. After his petition reached the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, He said: \"O servant present! Although Maneckji hath written the words of others and asked questions, yet from his letter can be inhaled the fragrance of love. Ask God to grant him that which He loveth.\"\n\nHe has asked a question, yet from his letter the fragrance of love is perceived. Ask God to make him attain to that which He loves and is pleased with, for verily He has power over all things. From this utterance of the All-Merciful a sweet fragrance wafts. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nHis other question concerns the principles of religion: In Islam there are both jurisprudence and fundamental principles, while in the Mahabadian and Hindu faiths there are only principles, with no other paths. They believe all rules are part of the principles, even drinking water and taking a wife - all matters of life are thus. He asks which is acceptable before God, exalted be His mention.\n\nThere are ranks and stations for principles. The foundation of foundations and the basis of elements has been and ever shall be the knowledge of God. The springtime of recognition of the All-Merciful is in these days. Whatever appears today from the Source of the Cause and the Manifestation of the Divine Self - that is the foundation, and obedience to it is incumbent upon all. The answer to this question lies in the blessed, firm and exalted word which states: \"Look to this day and speak of this day,\" for today is the lord of days. Whatever appears in it from the Source of God's Cause is truth. The foundation of foundations today is like unto an ocean, while other days are like gulfs and streams branching from it. Whatever is spoken and made manifest today is the foundation, the Mother of Utterance and the Mother of the Book. Though all days are attributed to God, exalted be His glory, these days are distinguished and adorned with the ornament of divine attribution, for in the books of the chosen ones and some of the prophets they are known as the Day of God.\n\nIn one sense, this Day and whatever appears in it are among the principles, while other days and what appears in them are considered branches. These branches are relative and comparative. For example, going to mosques, in relation to the knowledge of God, is considered among the branches, for the second depends upon the first. The principles current among the scholars of the age are rules they have arranged from which they deduce divine laws according to their views and schools. Consider the question of immediacy versus deferment. God, exalted be His glory, says \"Eat and drink.\" Now one does not know if carrying out this command must be immediate or if delay is permissible. Some hold that this becomes known through contextual evidence.\n\nOne of the most learned scholars in Najaf set out to circumambulate the fifth of the Family of the Cloak, peace be upon them, accompanied by a group of scholars. Along the way, Bedouin Arabs intended to plunder them. The aforementioned scholar immediately surrendered all he had. His students asked, \"Master, in this matter your view was in favor of deferment - what happened that you acted immediately?\" He replied, \"A believer, due to contextual evidence,\" and pointed to the Arabs' spears.\n\nIn Islam, the founder of principles was Abu Hanifa, who was among the Sunni leaders, and there were principles before as mentioned. However, acceptance or rejection today depends on the divine word. These differences are not worthy of mention. Whatever existed before, the glance of favor is directed toward it - we must not mention it except with goodness, for it had and has no contradiction with the foundation. The servant confesses that he has no knowledge and testifies that knowledge is with God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nToday, whatsoever is contrary to reality is rejected and shall remain rejected, for the Sun of Truth hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge and shineth forth resplendent. Blessed are they who have purified their hearts with the water of divine utterance from all impurities, allusions, and expressions, and have turned their faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon. This is the most great bounty and the supreme grace. Whoso hath attained thereunto hath attained unto all good, but the knowledge of all else but God hath never profited anyone, nor will it ever do so. These fundamentals and derivatives that have been mentioned are matters about which the divines of religion have discoursed according to their ranks. But now it is better that we hold fast to this word which declareth: \"Leave them to their vain disputes. Verily, He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Path. The Command belongeth to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\"\n\nAnother question: Some maintain that whatsoever is acceptable according to natural law and reason must be permissible and binding in religion, and whatsoever natural law and reason reject must not be done. While others maintain that whatsoever hath come from religious law and the Holy Lawgiver must be accepted without rational proof or natural evidence, and must be followed in blind obedience - such as the running between Safa and Marwa, the casting of stones, the wiping of the feet in ablution, and other prescribed acts. Let it be written which of these is acceptable.\n\nHere are minds that have ranks and levels, as philosophers have mentioned regarding this station - details of which are beyond the scope here and thus are passed over. It is quite evident and proven that people's minds are not and have never been at one level. The perfect mind has been and is a guide and mentor, as this exalted word was revealed from the Supreme Pen in response to this matter - His glory be magnified: \"The tongue of wisdom says: He who lacks Me lacks all things. Pass beyond all that exists and find Me. I am the Sun of perception and the Ocean of knowledge. I revive the withered ones and bring the dead to life. I am that Light which illumines the path of insight. I am the Royal Falcon of the hand of the Self-Subsisting. I unloose the bound wings and teach flight.\" End quote. Observe how clearly the answer to this matter has descended from the Kingdom of divine knowledge. Blessed are those who perceive, who think, and who know.\n\nWhat is meant by mind is the Universal Divine Mind. How often it is observed that some minds are not only not guides, but rather are fetters preventing the feet of travelers from the straight path. The particular mind has been and will always be limited. Man must search and investigate until he finds the Source and knows Him. Once knowledge of the Source - around which the Universal Mind revolves - is attained, whatever He commands is surely from the requirements of consummate wisdom. His existence differs from all else as the sun differs from other things. The essential thing is to know Him, and after knowing Him, whatever He commands is to be obeyed and corresponds to the requirements of divine wisdom. From all the Prophets of the past and before the past have come commands and prohibitions of every kind. From certain deeds observed today, the purpose is the preservation of God's Name, and the rewards for the doer are recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen. If someone draws a breath for God's sake, its reward will surely become manifest, just as this great verse was revealed from the heaven of divine will to the Lord of Batha \\[Muhammad\\]: \"We did not make the qiblah which you formerly observed except that We might know who follows the Messenger from who turns back on his heels.\"\n\nIf someone were to reflect today on this Most Holy, Most Exalted Manifestation and ponder what has been revealed in the verses, he would testify that Truth is sanctified above creation and that knowledge of all things has been and will be with Him. Every fair-minded person has testified and testifies that if someone hesitates in this Most Great Manifestation, he will find himself powerless and incapable of proving any matter, meaning any of his own doctrines. And those who are deprived of the robe of fairness and stand in tyranny say what the people of hatred and animosity have always said. Knowledge is with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nOne day this servant was present before His countenance and He said: \"O servant in attendance, what were you occupied with?\" I submitted: \"I was writing a reply to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu'l-Fadl.\" He said: \"Write to Jinab-i-Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be My Baha, that conditions have become such that the people of the age have become accustomed to tyranny and flee from justice. A Manifestation that has remembered God, glorified be His glory, with utmost greatness \\[...\\]\"\n\nIn one of the days, this servant was present before His Countenance when He asked, \"O servant in attendance, what were you occupied with?\" I submitted, \"I was writing a reply to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu'l-Fadl.\" He said, \"Write to Jinab-i-Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be Baha: Times have become such that the people of the age have grown accustomed to tyranny and flee from justice. A Revelation that hath remembered God, exalted be His glory, with utmost greatness, testified to His knowledge, and confessed His sanctification and transcendence above all peers and likeness, hath at times been called sun-worship and at other times fire-worship. How many great Manifestations and Dawning-Places have they remained heedless of their stations and deprived of their favors, nay rather, God forbid, they have cursed and reviled. One of the great Prophets, whom the ignorant Persians reject today, uttered these exalted words, saying: 'The sun is a round and dark body. It is not worthy, nor hath it ever been, to call it god or divine. The Divine Being is He Whom knowledge cannot comprehend, Whom the sciences of the world cannot limit, and Whose reality none hath known, knoweth, or shall ever know.' Observe how with eloquent and articulate tongue He hath testified to that which the Truth uttereth today. Nevertheless, in the eyes of these ignorant masses He is not even considered a believer, let alone His exalted stations. In another instance, that same Prophet declared: 'His existence is manifest through all existence, and were it not for God, none of creation would exist or be adorned with the robe of being.' God protect us and you from the evil of those who have denied the right of God and His loved ones and have turned away from the horizon testified to by the Books of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nFrom what hath been mentioned, it is evident that not every intellect is a true measure. The truly intelligent in the primary station have been and are the chosen ones of God, glorified be His majesty, whom God hath made the repositories of His knowledge, the recipients of His revelation, the dawning-places of His Cause, and the daysprings of His wisdom. These are they whom God hath made to stand in His stead on earth. Through them is manifested that which God hath willed. Whoso turneth unto them hath turned unto God, and whoso turneth away hath no mention before God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This station that hath been mentioned is the universal measure. Whosoever attaineth unto it, meaning he hath recognized and comprehended the Manifestation, is recorded and inscribed among the truly intelligent in the Book of God. Without this, one is ignorant, even should he consider himself possessed of all the world's knowledge.\n\nNow if one were to see himself as standing before God and, purified from aversion and prejudice, were to meditate upon all that hath been revealed and made manifest in this Most Great Revelation from the beginning until now, he would testify that pure spirits, perfect minds, refined souls, attentive ears, penetrating eyes, eloquent tongues, expanded breasts, and illumined hearts all circle in worship, nay rather, prostrate themselves before the throne of God's grandeur.\n\nAs to their other question regarding how previous Manifestations in their own dispensations made differing rulings - one making the flesh of the cow lawful and another unlawful, one making the flesh of the pig lawful and another unlawful, and so forth - they request that the Truth, exalted be His mention, set forth the religious prohibitions.\"\n\nAccording to outward appearances, mention and elaboration of this matter was beyond the requirements of wisdom, for diverse souls correspond with that honored person, and the answer ostensibly conflicts with the Islamic religion. Therefore, the answer was sent down allusively from the heaven of divine will. In the first passage which states \"The pulse of the world is in the hand of the skilled Physician\" to the end of His exalted words, was and is the answer to this passage. He says to look to this day and speak of this day - that is, look to God's decree. Whatever He ordains today and decrees as lawful is lawful. The true and correct word is that all must look to God's command and to that which appears from the horizon of His will, for in His name the banner of \"He doeth what He willeth\" is raised and the standard of \"He ordaineth what He pleaseth\" is unfurled. For instance, if He were to decree that water is forbidden, it would become forbidden, and likewise the opposite. Nothing among all things has \"This is lawful\" or \"This is forbidden\" written upon it - whatever has appeared and appears is through the Word of God, exalted be His glory. These matters are clear and need no elaboration. Some groups imagine that whatever decree they possess cannot change, that it was from eternity and will remain forever. Consider the final passage, blessed and exalted be His words: \"The measure of speech must be observed, that the newly arrived may remain and the tender plants may reach maturity. Milk must be given in proper measure, so that the children of the world may enter the realm of grandeur and abide in the court of unity.\" For example, some groups maintain that wine was forever forbidden and will forever be forbidden. Now if they were told it could one day be made lawful, they would rise in rejection and protest. The people of the world have not yet understood the meaning of \"He doeth what He willeth\" and have not grasped a portion of the Most Great Infallibility. A child must be given milk in its early days - if meat were given, it would perish. This would be sheer oppression and far removed from wisdom. Blessed are they that understand. The Most Great Infallibility, as was once heard from the Blessed Tongue, is specifically reserved for the Manifestations of God's Cause and the Dawning-Places of His Revelation. This matter is mentioned briefly, for time is lacking and is like the phoenix - spoken of but non-existent. Their other question concerns the religion of the Mahabadians and Hindus, that whoever follows any religion, in whatever form or composition, with whatever attributes and conditions, as long as they associate with you, show them kindness and treat them as brothers. In other religions it is not so - they persecute those of other faiths, consider tormenting them an act of worship, and deem their property and families lawful to seize. Which is acceptable to God? \\[...\\]\n\nThe first word was and ever shall be Truth. To harm any soul is not permitted, nor has it ever been. The persecution and oppression of God's servants is not acceptable before God. This exalted word hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen - blessed and exalted be His utterance: \"O servants! The religion of God and the faith of God have appeared for unity and concord. Make them not the cause of difference and discord.\" This matter hath been revealed and recorded in numerous tablets. The interpreter must convey the word with perfect mercy, kindness and compassion. Whoso turneth towards it and accepteth it is recorded as one of the denizens of the highest paradise in the Crimson Book, but if one accepteth it not, no opposition whatsoever is permitted. In one place He saith: \"Blessed is he who ariseth to serve the entire world.\" He hath likewise said that the people of Baha must soar above all the peoples of the world. All manner of religious hatred, malice, strife and contention have been forbidden. Today a sun hath dawned from the horizon of divine favor, upon whose brow this exalted word hath been inscribed by the Supreme Pen: \"We have created you for love and faithfulness, not for hatred and enmity.\" And likewise in another place it hath been revealed in Persian that which melteth the hearts of \\[them that are near and\\] the sincere ones, draweth diverse conditions to the dawning-place of unity, causeth all to be illumined by the lights of oneness, and to turn toward the divine horizon of knowledge. Blessed and exalted is His utterance: \"The one true Friend proclaimeth: The way of freedom hath been opened, hasten ye thereunto. The fountain of knowledge is gushing, drink ye thereof. Say: O friends! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.\" And justice, which is to give each his due, dependeth upon two words: reward and punishment. In this regard, every soul must receive the recompense of his deeds, for the repose and tranquility of the world depend upon this, even as hath been said - exalted be His utterance: \"The pavilion of \\[order in\\] the world standeth upon two pillars: reward and punishment.\" In brief, for every occasion there is a fitting utterance, and for every time an appropriate deed. Blessed are they who have arisen for God's sake, who speak for God's sake, and who return unto God.\n\nThe other question regarding the Hindu and Zoroastrian faiths is that they do not permit or accept those from without who wish to enter their religion, while in the Christian faith whoever comes of his own accord is allowed to enter, though they neither proclaim nor insist upon it, whereas in the faiths of Muhammad and Moses they insist upon this matter and make it obligatory, moreover if one does not comply they become enemies and consider their property and dependents lawful to seize - which of these is acceptable to God? \\[...\\]\n\nAll human beings are brothers, and the conditions of brotherhood are many. Among them is that whatsoever one desires for oneself, one should desire the same for one's brothers. Therefore, if a friend attains unto outward or inward bounties, or heavenly sustenance, he should inform his friends with utmost love and kindness. If they accept, the purpose is achieved; if not, they should leave him to himself without any objection or utterance that might cause the slightest sorrow. This is the truth \\[and after truth\\] there is naught but error.\n\nHis honour, that peerless friend--may God assist him--has written that the Hindu and Zoroastrian peoples do not permit anyone who desires to enter their religions. This is contrary \\[to\\] the sending of Messengers and what is found in their Books, for every one who appears from God is sent for the guidance of the servants and their education. How can they prevent the seeker and the searcher from the Sought and the Goal? The fire temples of the world bear witness and, with burning ardour, called in their time unto all on earth and summoned them unto the Pure Lord.\n\nThey have likewise written that in the Christian religion, whosoever comes of his own accord is permitted to enter, but they make no proclamation or insistence. This point too is mistaken, for they have shown and continue to show great insistence on teaching. Nearly thirty million is spent by their national organization, and their missionaries are scattered throughout all lands, engaging with the utmost zeal and effort in teaching the Christian religion. Thus have they encompassed the world. How many schools and churches they have built so that children might acquire knowledge--but their inner purpose is that they might both study and, in childhood, hear the stories of Christ, that what they intend might be imprinted upon the mirrors of their being while yet untarnished by dust. No religion has been seen to match their insistence in promoting the religion of Christ.\n\nIn any case, what is true today and acceptable at the Divine Threshold is what was mentioned at first: man has come for the reformation of the world and must arise to serve his brothers for the sake of God. He should rejoice at acceptance, that his brother has attained unto the everlasting bounty; if not, he should beseech God for his guidance, without causing the other party to sense any hatred or aversion from him. The Command is in God's hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nWe beseech God, exalted be His glory, that we may recognize and find the absolutely Wise One, and after recognition and proof of what He is, the conjectures and imaginings of the peoples of the world shall cause Him no harm. The Wise One holds the pulse of the world in His mighty grasp. Perhaps He may at times excise certain diseased members lest they infect other members, and this is the very essence of compassion and mercy. None may object to Him, for He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAs to their further question concerning the Me-Abadian and Zoroastrian faiths, wherein they claim \"Our religion and path is superior and better than other religions,\" while also saying that all other Prophets and their religions are true, likening them to the various ranks in a king's court from the prime minister down to the soldier, each having their station before God, and that they interfere with no one in their choice of religion - while the Hindus say that whoever eats meat, by whatever name or form, shall never see Paradise, and the followers of Muhammad, Jesus and Moses say that whoever does not accept their religion shall never glimpse Paradise - which of these is acceptable to God, exalted be His remembrance?\n\nAs to their statement that their religion and path is superior to the religions of other Prophets, they mean the Prophets who came before them. These holy Souls are united in one station - their First is their Last and their Last is their First. All have come from God, called to Him, and returned to Him. The Book of Certitude, which is truly the Lord of Books and which flowed from the Supreme Pen at the beginning of this most great Revelation, has revealed these matters. Blessed is he who witnesses, sees and ponders it out of love for God, the Lord of all creation.\n\nRegarding their statement that Hindus say whoever eats meat shall not see Paradise - this contradicts their other statement that all are true, for if truth is established, the denial of Paradise has no meaning. It is not known what they intend by Paradise or how they understand it. Whosoever today attains to the good-pleasure of God, exalted be His glory, is accounted among the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven, and shall find its fruits in all the divine worlds. By the life of the Desired One! The pen is powerless to mention this station and falls short of describing these words. Blessed is he who attains unto His good-pleasure, and woe to the heedless. After the station of any Prophet sent by God is established, none may utter a word of objection. All must accept and obey whatever He ordains. This is what God hath decreed in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets.\n\nTheir further question concerns the Hindus' belief that God created wisdom in human form called Brahma, who came to the world and became the source of civilization, and they are his descendants. The Zoroastrians say God created, through the First Intelligence, a man named Me-Abad, and they are his descendants. Since they recognize only six types of origins for the world - two being what was just mentioned, and the others being creation from water, earth, fire, and from bears and monkeys - the Hindus and Parsees say that since their origin is from wisdom, they do not accept other peoples. Is this statement of theirs correct or not? Let the wise guides explain as they deem appropriate.\n\nThe entirety of creation hath been called into being through the Will of God, exalted be His glory, and the wondrous being of man hath been brought into existence through the potent Word of God. He is the dawning-place, the repository, the source and the manifestation of intellect, and through him creation hath come into being. He is the intermediary of the primal grace. From the beginning of creation, none hath comprehended its true nature save the knowledge of God, glorified be His mention, which encompasseth all things, both before and after its existence. The beginning and end of creation hath not been limited, and its mystery hath not been made manifest to anyone. His knowledge hath ever been and will continue to be treasured in the repositories of divine knowledge. The contingent nature of the world lieth in its being preceded by a cause, while absolute pre-existence hath ever been and will continue to be the exclusive attribute of God, glorified be His mention. This word hath been mentioned so that from the earlier statement - that the beginning and end of creation is not limited - none should perceive the fragrance of pre-existence. True, absolute pre-existence belongeth exclusively to God, while the world possesseth only a relative and attributive pre-existence. Whatsoever hath been deduced concerning firstness and lastness, or that which transcendeth them, hath been taken from the Prophets, the chosen ones, and the Messengers of God. The world of particles, which is well-known, existed during the advent of the Prophets, and all else is imaginary and mere conjecture. At the time of manifestation, all creation existeth on one plane, and thereafter they become differentiated through acceptance and rejection, ascent and descent, motion and stillness, turning toward or away. For example, God, exalted be His glory, through the tongue of His Manifestation, declareth \"Am I not your Lord?\" Whosoever is blessed to say \"Yea\" is accounted as the most exalted of creation in the sight of God. The purpose is that before the utterance of the Word, all are observed on the same plane and station, and afterward differences appear and continue to appear, as ye have witnessed and continue to witness. From what hath been mentioned, it is established and proven that none can say \"We were created from intellect, and others from something else.\" The truth that shineth bright as the sun is that all have been created by the Will of God and have proceeded from a single source. The beginning of all things is from Him, and unto Him shall be the return of all things. This is the meaning of the blessed verse \"To God do we belong, and to Him shall we return\" which hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Qur'an. It is clear and evident to that honored one that what hath been mentioned is the answer to all, in but one of the passages that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are they who, sanctified from the conditions of creation and purified from idle fancies and vain imaginings, stroll in the gardens of divine knowledge, that they may behold in all things the signs of His grandeur. Many things have been written in the name of that honored person. If he himself should become aware and discover its fruits, he would become so joyous that the sorrows of the world would never grieve him. God willing, may they mention this word with perfect expression, that is to say, with the tongue of truth, and act upon it. He saith: \"Say: God; then leave them to their vain discussions.\" And may they strive to guide the people who dwell in the dark corners \\[...\\]\n\nLet them strive to lead forth those veiled souls who remain in the corners of darkness and gloom into the light of the sun. Let them grasp, in the Most Great Name, a standard that betokens naught but the Manifestation, and march at the forefront of the peoples of old, that perchance the darkness of the world may be dispelled and the lights of the Sun of Truth may encompass the earth. This is the most great bounty and the most exalted station. If man attaineth not unto this station, to what can he find solace, with what can he find intimacy, upon what can he stand, by what can he be moved, in whose remembrance doth he sleep, and in whose name doth he arise? Again, we are God's and unto Him do we return.\n\nAs to their final question regarding the Tablets that have been revealed - those that have been seen were mostly in the Arabic tongue. Since in this time the Beloved hath come speaking Persian, Arabic is rejected and abandoned, even as the Arabs themselves have not yet understood or comprehended the meaning of the Qur'an. The Persian tongue is desired, esteemed and sought after by the people of the inhabited quarter of the earth, just as Persian is distinguished from Arabic, and ancient Persian is likewise distinguished from it. Among the Indians and others it is especially beloved. It would be better if God, exalted be His mention, would hereafter mostly speak in pure Persian, as it better attracts the hearts. The request is that the response to this servant's petition be graciously bestowed in pure Persian.\n\nBoth Arabic and Persian are good, for what is desired of language is to comprehend the speaker's words, and this is achieved through both. And today, since the sun of knowledge hath appeared manifest from the heaven of Persia, whatever praise ye render unto this language is befitting.\n\nIn truth, the light of reality shineth resplendent from the horizon of divine utterance. There hath been and is no need for mention of this evanescent one and his like. There is no doubt about the sweetness of the Persian tongue, but it doth not possess the breadth of Arabic. There are many things for which no expression hath been made in Persian - that is, no word hath been established to signify them. However, in the Arabic tongue multiple names have been established for every thing. No language on earth hath had or hath the vastness and breadth of Arabic. This word is mentioned with fairness and truth; otherwise it is evident that today the world is illumined by the Sun that hath risen and shone forth from the horizon of Persia. In this case, whatever praise is offered to this sweet language is befitting.\n\nAll the questions of that honored personage were mentioned and answers were dispatched. If deemed advisable and wisdom dictates, there is no harm in their being reviewed, and likewise the gentlemen of that land such as the honored Ali-Qabl-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power, and the honored Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, may review them. This servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to adorn the world of humanity with justice and fairness. Although fairness is itself one of the attributes of justice, justice is a lamp that guides humanity in the darkness of the world and protects from dangers. It is the brilliant lamp - may God illumine the rulers of the earth with its light. Verily this servant beseeches God to assist all to do what He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of the last and the first. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nRegarding the honored Haji Shaykh Hadi, upon him be the glory of God, who was mentioned - convey greetings on behalf of this ephemeral one. It behooveth him to manifest the greatest steadfastness in the Cause of his Lord, the Lord of all beings. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist him in this, that he may guide people to the path of righteousness. I swear by the Sun of divine utterance that creation itself came into being for this Cause. Although this servant mentions to the gentlemen that which causes exaltation, ascendancy and enkindlement, yet he has been and is forbidden from revealing most matters. Were that which is hidden to be revealed, souls would take flight, solid rock would melt, how much more so hearts.\n\nWe beseech God to raise up souls who are pure in motive, that they may engage in purifying the world and its peoples, and through wisdom and utterance cause all to attain the true life-giving waters, that all may be illumined by the light of truth and cast off their old, antiquated, and sullied characteristics in the name of Truth, and be adorned with holy spiritual qualities, goodly words and righteous deeds. O friends! Make an effort - now is the time, now is the time! After a few days, most souls now living will be buried beneath the earth. For these few days, one should not be deprived of eternal life. Strive that all may attain that which, were the people of earth to search throughout the duration of the kingdom and heavenly realm, they would find nothing like unto it. I conclude these words at this point with mention of God's chosen ones and His friends who have arisen to praise Him and serve His decisive, wise Cause.\n\nThat regarding the honored leaf, the wife of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abdul-Hadi, upon her and upon him be the Glory of God, and her degrees of sincerity, steadfastness, perseverance and service in the path of God which you had written - this detailed account was presented before His presence and He showed His favor. Some time ago, a Most Holy and Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abdul-Hadi, upon him be the Glory of God, and mention of the leaf was detailed in the Tablet and sent. No one strives in the path of God except that their mention flows from the Supreme Pen. How many souls were engaged in unworthy deeds that in truth were not befitting of God and His loved ones and His days, yet nevertheless He showed them favor due to their love and devotion. One day in Iraq, a person committed an unseemly act and attained the Most Holy Court. After his departure, He said: \"O servant! Since the grace of the divine days is all-encompassing, We showed him favor, otherwise he deserved to be stoned.\" Similarly, on another day when He was going out towards the Shrine and this servant was present, He mentioned one of the friends and showed favor from the Dawning-Place of grace. And this servant was somewhat bewildered due to certain matters he had heard and personally observed. This bewilderment was not from questioning, for through His grace this servant had been blessed to know that whatever He says is truth, even if He were to praise the worst of creation with the utmost mention and tribute, for the banner of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" is raised through His name and \"He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth\" circumambulates. Rather, the bewilderment was from the greatness of His grace and manifestations of His favor. Immediately He said: \"No, no, O servant! Be assured that he is deprived of most divine favors in the infinite worlds. But since the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation have encompassed the world, he has become the recipient of favor according to his capacity due to his devotion and love. Ask God that all may attain the station of contentment and be honored with the greatest favors. And likewise ask God that they may be aided to return, for verily I am the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. Today the gate of grace is open, the sun of favor is shining, and the ocean of bounty is surging. A single moment of these days is superior to centuries and ages, for the fragrance of the divine garment is diffused therein. Blessed are they that attain!\" Similar utterances were repeatedly heard from the Tongue of the Revealer of verses. O beloved of my heart! His favor has reached such a degree that He says: \"O Son of Man! Observe My commandments for the love of My beauty.\" If a soul were to discover the fragrance of this word and its sweetness and the mercy that can be derived from it, they would declare with a hundred thousand tongues: \"I turn unto Thee and return unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!\" Two matters are very essential today: one is the unity of the friends of God, and the other is the sanctification of deeds. These two are the means of ascent for souls, two pillars for the pavilion of knowledge, two wings for the believers, and two oceans for those who thirst in the valley \\[...\\]\n\nAnd they are two seas for the thirsty ones in the valley \\[...\\] and two suns for the heaven of meanings. Once They said: \"O servant, write to His Honor Fadl that he must strive and become the cause of unity. If they act according to what God hath revealed in the Book, the Truth will bestow that which before \\[its manifestation\\] the mind was powerless and incapable of comprehending.\" Say: Let them refer to the revealed Tablets that they may become aware and conscious of the power, majesty, knowledge and all-embracing nature of the Truth, exalted be His glory. Verily the Glory preventeth all from following their desires and calleth them unto that which hath been ordained in the Psalms and Tablets.\n\nThis evanescent one and that honored one beseech the Truth to grant all attentive ears and penetrating vision, that the counsel of counselors, the exhortation of exhorters, and the utterance of the sincere may prove effective and direct the realm of ignorance to the horizon of the heaven of knowledge.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Siyyid-hood, this is most evident and clear. Those souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of certitude, by the Most Great Ocean, those souls have been and are the Siyyids of the people. If through divine grace and infinite mercy this station is realized for a person, his relation is to the Truth, exalted be His glory. At the head of Tablets, this servant writes the revelation, and afterwards the Two Most Great Branches--may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps--inscribe the Tablets. However, your Tablet specifically, the Ancient Beauty commanded it to be written in this manner. Write that it is requested that you convey greetings to all the friends in that land. This evanescent one presents his respects to all and beseeches that, God willing, they may hold fast to such means and perform such deeds as will cause the sanctification and glorification of the Cause of God.\n\nThis servant has mentioned each one in the Most Holy Court, and likewise has written concerning each one that which he was commanded. In this case, it would seem he has some small claim, and by virtue of this claim he submits that the recompense, reward and acceptance of that service to each one is that from this party, who have been named by the name of God, such qualities should be manifested as will cause the exaltation of the Word, the attraction of people, and the turning of hearts.\n\nAnd concerning the mention of Aqa Siyyid Ru?u'llah and Mashhadi Baqir, upon them be the Glory of God, it was submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for the first, His word, exalted be His grandeur:\n\nIn My Name, the Answerer\n\nSay: O friends, until ye are purified from the defilement of self and desire, ye shall not attain true tranquility. Today this exalted Word shineth as the sun from the horizon of the Divine Book: Act ye in accordance with what beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. God willing, may ye be adorned with such an adornment as to attain distinction in the assemblage of the world. O Ru?u'llah! The Wronged One mentioneth thee and commandeth that which is befitting. Strive thou to be blessed in all times with the breath of the Holy Spirit. Today the Spirit crieth out in the wilderness of longing and giveth glad tidings to all who are on earth of the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Say: O friends, today is the day of acceptance and today is the day of deeds. Hold fast to the cord of steadfastness and cling to the hem of sanctity. This is the counsel of the Wronged One of the horizons to His loved ones. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and upon those who have attained unto the Word of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for the latter, I am the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing: \\[...\\]\n\nBlessed is he who hath turned unto Mine all-highest horizon, and hath heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree, and hath beheld Mine All-Greatest Sign. He is of the people of Baha inscribed in the Crimson Tablet which none hath understood save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee, and counsel thee with that wherewith We have counseled Our loved ones, and I am the Counselor, the All-Wise. Shouldst thou become aware of the ocean of My bounty and the heaven of My grace, thou wouldst surely call out this Name by night and by day. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Whoso hath attained unto My Word and acted according to what is in My Book, he hath attained unto that which no swift scribe can reckon. The glory be upon thee and upon him who hath attained unto My presence and upon him who hath answered his Lord, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nNo Name among Names remained except that there was revealed for it that which the treasures \\[...\\] cannot equal even one letter thereof. Well is it with them and may it be wholesome for them. This lowly one also conveyeth greetings and glorification to them, and giveth them the glad-tidings of God's bounties. Blessed is the soul that hath become the recipient of glad-tidings and hath truly attained unto the hearing of the utterance of the All-Merciful. He is assuredly among those who are brought near unto God in His Book, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Glory shining forth from the horizon of the bounty of our Lord, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, be upon you and upon those mentioned in your letter and upon those who have attained unto the announcement of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Great.\n\nThe Servant\n\n14 Sha'ban al-Mu'azzam 1299\n\nIn His Name, He is the All-Glorious!\n\nThe servants of the True One must be patient and forbearing during this time of afflictions and trials. Perhaps through God's grace and bounty manifest transformations shall come to pass in this world and through His loving-kindness the divine springtime shall come to fruition. In truth, before Divine Justice all people must be held accountable for their deeds, but the friends must, in all conditions, remain steadfast and immovable in the Cause of God and firmly grasp the cord of His assistance. The Power of God shall assuredly resolve all difficulties.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n=== END BH00048 ===\n\n=== START BH00049 ===\n\nHe is the Glorious, the Most Glorious! In the name of the One God, exalted be His unity and oneness! The Supreme Pen hath ever been moved and flowing in praise of His loved ones, and hath never been withheld or stilled from its endless outpourings. The breezes of grace from the sanctuary of oneness have ever wafted and shall continue to waft over all created things. Exalted be this breeze that, in less than a moment, can transport those veiled by the shrouds of heedlessness and lethargy to the sacred abode of unity and vision, and can guide, quicker than the twinkling of an eye, those sick in the wilderness of ignorance to the supreme horizon - the station of divine knowledge and the realm of utterance.\n\nThe paths of His guidance have never been concealed from any wayfarer, nor have the ways of His grace been barred to any seeker. Yet how can the breezes of divine grace reach those who dwell in the valley of deprivation when they flee from the holy divine breeze and wage war against the Beauty of the Divine Unity? The gaze of God watcheth from above all heads, yet none perceiveth it; the Kingdom of God is manifest before all eyes, yet none is aware of it. How many are the breezes of the All-Merciful that have passed over the heedless at dawn, finding them all oblivious to the Beauty of the All-Bountiful, lying asleep upon the bed of negligence, whereupon these breezes return to the most exalted Paradise at the right hand of the divine Throne.\n\nNever hath the outpouring from the source of My bounty been cut off, nor hath grace from the treasury of My favor been withheld. The hand of My mercy is vastly outstretched and encompassing, and within My grasp of power all things are held captive. Yet this infinite grace and beginningless bounty can only be received by those who enter beneath the shadow of the education of Him in Whose hand lies the Kingdom of all things, and who dwell in the spiritual realm of \"His mercy precedeth all things.\"\n\nConsider the seed: if it be sown by the hands of the Manifestations of divine names in pure, goodly and blessed soil, assuredly the ears of divine grace and the fruits of knowledge and divine wisdom will appear from it, of itself and for itself. But if it be cast upon barren, unpleasing soil, no fruit or trace will ever come forth from it. Thus hath it been ordained by the Mighty, the Ancient One. These stations are clear and evident to anyone of insight; the clarity of this path needeth no proof, for it can be seen with the outer eye and observed with manifest vision.\n\nTherefore, if all created things deprive themselves of the wondrous grace of God and the education of the King of Oneness, this will not affect the wafting of the breezes of grace, for they have deprived and veiled themselves from the cloud of divine mercy and favor. Thus, strive to draw thyself beneath the shade of the divine Tree, that thou mayest be nourished by the fruits of infinite grace. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings, from which all are now veiled, that should all created things enter with true certitude beneath the shade of this manifest Tree and remain steadfast in His love, they would all be adorned with the blessed robes of \"He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\" None comprehendeth this save those who have detached themselves from all who are in the heavens and earth and have fled from their own selves unto the Self of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nNow consider: if anyone should deprive himself of this heavenly outpouring of divine clouds \\[...\\]\n\nFar have they fled from their own selves unto the Self of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Consider now, if a soul should deprive himself of these showers from the divine cloud and content himself with words that neither nourish nor satisfy, how could he ever be worthy of this supreme bounty and this most great gift? Nay, by My very Self, the Truth! None shall be worthy thereof save honored servants.\n\nO Nasir, O My servant! By God, the Truth! The Youth of the Spirit stands this day above all heads with the most exalted nectar, observing and waiting to see upon whom His glance may fall, that they might, without any gesture, take and drink from His snow-white hand. Yet none have thus far attained to this matchless draught from the everlasting Sovereign save a few, and these abide in the Most Exalted Paradise, above all heavens, established upon the thrones of constancy. By God! Neither the Mirrors, nor the Manifestations of Names, nor all that was or ever shall be, can ever excel them, if ye be of them that know.\n\nO Nasir! These are not days wherein the understanding of those who comprehend or the perception of those who perceive can grasp His grace--how much less the heedless and the veiled! And if thou wouldst cleanse thine eye from the greatest veils, thou wouldst witness such a bounty as hath no likeness, peer, equal, or similitude from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end. Yet by what utterance can the tongue of God speak, that the veiled might comprehend it? The righteous drink of the holy nectar in My Most Glorious Name from the Supreme Kingdom, while for others there is no share.\n\nIn any case, thy letter reached the Sacred Court and thy lamentation and sighing were heard. At the beginning of thy letter were these words:\n\nThough outwardly I am far from Thy presence,\n\nYet my heart and soul are ever with Thee.\n\nKnow that thou wert not far removed in outward appearance, rather We raised thee up in a Temple and commanded thee to enter the divine Ridvan of the Beloved, yet thou didst pause, standing bewildered in the courtyard of the Gate, and hast not yet attained to entry into the Holy City of the Eternal and the Seat of Glory of the All-Merciful. Observe now how the Gate of Grace is opened and thou art bidden to enter, yet thou hast veiled thyself with doubts and idle fancies, remaining distant from the seat of nearness. By God the Truth! At all times thou and thy like are observed - some halted at the pass of questioning, others paused at the pass of bewilderment, and some veiled at the pass of names. Therefore hearken unto the Call of the Divine Grandeur, which at every moment and from all directions calleth out to thee and all things, saying: \"By God the Truth! The Revealer of Power hath appeared at the Most Great Horizon, and that which was never manifested hath been manifested. Then did trembling seize the temples of the Manifestations of Names and all who are in earth and heaven, and most of them denied and fled. Say: O people! By God, the Almighty, the Beloved! The sun is darkened and the moon is troubled, for the Most Great Ocean hath surged within itself through His Most Great, Most Exalted Name. O people! Know ye the worth of these days wherein floweth the Salsabil and Tasnim, and then this most holy, most pure Kawthar. Therefore turn your faces unto Him and pay no heed to every turbid spring.\"\n\nDespite this sweet divine Call and holy, glorious Melody which at all times speaketh and singeth with most wondrous accent, no one hath become aware in himself. Then were all possessors of eyes blinded, all possessors of ears deafened, all possessors of tongues struck dumb, all possessors of hearts veiled, all possessors of knowledge rendered ignorant, and all possessors of wisdom withheld, save him whom God aided through His grace and who was detached from all the worlds.\n\nO Nasir! In My first Manifestation I shed light upon all contingent beings through the second letter of My Name, in such wise that none had any cause for rejection or objection. I summoned all servants unto My eternal holy Ridvan and called them to the everlasting holy Kawthar. Yet observe how much oppression and tyranny was manifested by the people of error, to an extent that none can reckon save God, until at last they suspended My radiant Body in the air and wounded it with the bullets of hatred and malice, until My spirit returned to the Supreme Companion, gazing upon the Most Glorious Raiment. Yet none reflected on why I accepted such harm from My servants, for had they reflected, they would not have remained veiled from My Beauty in My second Manifestation through one of My Names. Such is the state of these servants and their rank and station. Leave thou the mention of them and what floweth from their pens and issueth from their mouths.\n\nAlthough in all the Tablets of the Bayan I commanded all My servants not to remain heedless of My subsequent Manifestation and not to be veiled from the King of attributes by the veils of names and allusions, yet now thou canst observe that they were not content with remaining veiled, but have cast countless stones of doubts at the hidden Tree of Glory without pause or delay. Even this did not suffice them, until one of My Names whom I created with a single letter \\[...\\]\n\nAnd yet this did not suffice, until one of My names, whom I created with a single letter and gave life with a single breath, rose up to wage war against My Beauty. By God, the Truth! He opposed the Chosen Beauty with such denial and pride as has no likeness. Nevertheless, presuming people to be without insight or consciousness, and seeing all minds as dependent upon his acceptance or rejection, he attributed his own reprehensible deeds to the Most Pure Beauty, that he might spread it through God's cities, hoping thereby through such insinuations and schemes to deprive people of the Cause of causes. This matter was initially hidden from all and none were aware save two souls - one of them, who was named Ahmad, was martyred in his Lord's path and ascended to the highest station, and the other, who was named Kalim, was present at that time before Us.\n\nIn any case, We turn the discourse away from this topic, for it would be a pity for the Pen of Destiny to write of such matters. Now return thou to the Most Sublime Vision in less than a moment and observe thyself before the Lord of all worlds. Reflect upon this exalted Revelation, and likewise observe with penetrating vision the proofs of the Messengers. Look with fairness at what these servants have believed in, beyond which they have not observed with their outward eyes. If they have become certain of the Manifestations of Divine Unity through the revelation of horizonal and personal signs, by God! The horizons have been filled with the effulgences of this Dawning to such extent that the followers of previous religions would testify, let alone the people of the paths of guidance. None but the stubborn denier would deny this evident power. And if they look to the revealed verses, they have encompassed existence, both unseen and visible, descending from the clouds of Divine grace and the rain of Divine bounty to such degree that in a single hour the equivalent of a thousand verses are revealed. Were it not for consideration of the weakness of the servants and the corruption in the lands, permission would surely be granted for all to appear before the Most Great Throne and witness with their outward eyes the most noble breaths of the Holy Spirit.\n\nStrange it is that these heedless, immature servants, in this time when the Sun of the Beauty of the Glorious One has been rising and shining at its zenith, none have observed with their own eyes or become aware through their own selves. This heedlessness was only because all have prevented themselves from recognizing the All-Knowing Sovereign through thick veils of fancy, and have remained deprived of the holy, firm City of the Eternal through the flimsiest of dwellings.\n\nO servants! Hasten from the turbid mirage of fancy to the living fountain of certainty of the Lord of all worlds, and take up residence on the shores of the Kawthar of mercy for those drawn nigh. Say: O people! Come somewhat to your senses and do not again suspend the Most High Beauty in the atmosphere of hatred, and do not crucify the Spirit on the cross of rancor, and do not cast the Most Glorious Joseph into the well of envy, and do not sever the purified and manifest head with the sword of malice, and do not banish from land to land. By God! All of this has befallen Me, but the people do not perceive.\n\nVerily, in My holy words and intimate allusions My glances of favor have ever been directed toward My friends, and in the primal reality the true addressees in all utterances have been and shall ever be the friends of God. Therefore, O My friends, strive not to find the limited horizons grief-stricken and darkened through separation from the Luminary of Oneness. Rather, endeavor to be illumined by the lights of the holy manifestations of the Glorious and Eternal, and be not deprived of the fountainhead of divine grace and the source of the bounty of the Sovereign of Oneness. How blessed is he who turneth toward Him with his heart, who seeketh shelter beneath His shade, who establisheth himself in His holy precincts, who fleeth from all else save Him, and who attaineth unto the wellspring of His guidance! Thus doth the Most Great Spirit command you, if ye be of them that hear.\n\nAt this moment, verily, the Primal Point standeth at the right hand of the Most Glorious Throne, speaking these sublime, goodly, blessed, manifest and evident words: O My servants! My purpose in My Manifestation and My object in My appearance hath been and shall ever be none other than to herald the Beauty of My Beloved. The veils of fancy and the thick clouds that stood as an impregnable barrier among men and prevented them from the Sovereign of Ancient Days - all these did I rend asunder through My power and might. Thus have ye witnessed how at the time of the appearance of My Beauty the people remained veiled from My recognition through their vain imaginings. In the Bayan I counseled all with the tongue of power that at the time of the Manifestation they should not remain veiled from the recognition of His Self by any thing whatsoever, whether by the Letters or the Mirrors or by whatsoever hath been created in all the heavens and earth. For the Eternal Essence hath ever been known by His Own Self, and all else in His holy presence is mere nothingness and absolute void. How can the created attain unto its Creator, and the non-existent unto the Sovereign of existence? Nay, by Him Who holdeth My soul in His hands! Rather shall they attain unto that which hath been ordained for them from the traces of His manifestations. Thus have We sent down the Command in all the Tablets, would that ye might perceive.\n\nDespite all these binding counsels and conclusive admonitions, after the appearance of My Beauty, Whose lights have encompassed all created things and Who hath appeared and become manifest in such wise as the eyes of creation have never witnessed the like thereof, some of you have nonetheless arisen in sheer opposition, others have risen up in hostility, and yet others have clung to mere acceptance and denial. Evil is that which ye have wrought against your own selves and have imagined in your thoughts. By My Beauty! All who are in the heavens and earth are this day but as a handful of dust before the Lord of Lords. Blessed is he who hath ascended to the holy heights and risen to the intimate stations and hath recognized the scene of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nConsider now with fairness: if ye deprive yourselves of this Beauty of Oneness, this flowing Stream, this dawning Sun, this soaring Cloud, this all-encompassing Mercy, and this all-pervading Power, unto what direction will ye turn? Nay, by Him Who holdeth My soul in His hands! There remaineth for you no refuge save in the depths of the fire. Cleanse the rheum from your eyes, then open them through My love; search then throughout the reaches of the heavens and earth - can ye find a mercy greater than that which hath appeared? Nay, by My Most Great Scene, were ye but to know! And were ye to traverse all horizons, could ye find a power more wondrous than your Lord's, the All-Merciful? Nay, by My Bountiful Self, were ye but aware!\n\nO servants! I have turned the gaze of all from all directions that perchance ye may not remain veiled at the time of My manifestation.\n\nWere you to traverse the horizons, would you find a power more wondrous than the power of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Nay, by My generous Self, were you of those who perceive! Indeed, O servants, I turned the gaze of all from all directions, that perchance at the time of My manifestation you would not remain veiled and would not be heedless of the ultimate purpose. Now it is observed that all of you, like the peoples of the past - nay, more severely and greatly - have remained far from the Manifestation of Divine Beauty due to imaginary veils, written allusions, and verbal indications, and yet you suppose yourselves to be among the virtuous and guided ones. Nay, by the Self of Baha, were you to reflect! Would that you had been content with these things alone and had not raised hands of malice against the manifest Tree! O heedless ones! What, after all, was the cause of My martyrdom, and what was the purpose of the sacrifice of My spirit? If you say it was the revealed laws, these laws have been and will always be secondary to recognition of the Divine, and how can those who remain veiled from the root hold fast to its branch? And if you say the purpose was the Letters and Mirrors, all were and will be created by His will. O people! Fear God and compare not His Self to your selves, nor His attributes to your attributes, nor His beauty to your beauty, nor His signs to your signs, nor His utterance to your utterances, nor His sovereignty to what is among and within you, nor His words to your words, nor His exposition to your exposition, nor His walking to your walking, nor His repose to your repose. Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and be among the God-fearing! If you believe in My Self, by God, this is My Self, and if you believe in My verses, by God, He hath sent down that which was never sent down before to anyone, and to this beareth witness Mine own Self, then Mine essence, then My heart and tongue, and beyond Me testifieth to it that which appeareth from His presence, were you of those who know. O people of the Bayan! Deprive not yourselves of the Holy Self of the All-Merciful, and seek not to cling to this or that. Whoso willeth, let him hearken unto the melodies of the Spirit, and whoso turneth away, he is indeed the best of hearers and knowers. O people of the Bayan! Have you not observed that for twenty years He arose by His own Self to face His enemies? Many were the nights when you all slept in beds of ease while this Beauty of Divine Unity stood manifest and firm before the polytheists, and many were the days when, out of fear for your own selves, you kept yourselves protected and concealed in veils of concealment, while the Beauty of mighty steadfastness was evident, manifest, and apparent among the polytheists. Yet, not content with what the enemies have wrought, most of you have risen to war against the Beauty of Divine Unity. By God! Therefore doth Mine eye weep, and My heart burn, and My being tremble, and My skin shiver, and My bones crush, and My pillars shake, and I know not what more you wish to inflict upon Him and bring against Him. Nay, We have been knowing of all this, and all is preserved with Us in tablets of glory.\n\nHere are these heavenly words which the Most Exalted Tongue hath uttered. Blessed is he who hearkeneth unto the Words of God and purifieth himself from all who are in earth and heaven and from whatsoever hath been created therein, that he may enter the City of Immortality, which is the most holy and resplendent extinction. Well is it with them that are assured and have attained, and blessed is he who beholdeth the Words of God with his own eyes and turneth not toward the objections of the world.\n\nFor We have created every soul today like unto this world - just as in the world there are diverse cities and different villages, and likewise trees and fruits and leaves and branches and twigs, and seas and mountains and all that is visible therein, even so within man all these diverse things exist. Thus doth one soul warrant being called a world. However, in the believers are witnessed holy attributes - for example, the heaven of knowledge and the earth of tranquility and the trees of oneness and the twigs of detachment and the branches of sanctity and the roses of certitude and the flowers of love for the Beauty of the All-Merciful and the seas of learning and the rivers of wisdom and the pearls of Divine glory are found therein.\n\nAnd two kinds of believers are observed: from some this divine favor is veiled, for they have deprived themselves of beholding this all-encompassing mercy through unworthy veils. And some, through the grace of the All-Merciful, have had their vision opened and through the glances of God they perceive that which hath been deposited within their souls, and they witness the signs of divine power and the wondrous manifestations of God's handiwork in themselves with their outer and inner sight.\n\nAnd whosoever attaineth unto this station hath attained unto the day wherein \"God will render everyone independent out of His abundance\" and hath understood that day, and beholdeth himself in such wise under the shadow of his Lord's riches that he perceiveth within himself all things that have been created in the heavens and on earth - nay rather, he seeth himself encompassing all things, were he to look with the eye of God.\n\nAnd should one of these souls arise with firm and mighty steadfastness in the Cause of God, he would verily triumph over all the peoples of the world. To this testifieth that which the Tongue of God hath set in motion with the sovereignty of power and might and ascendancy: \"By God the Truth! Should anyone arise for the love of Baha in the world of creation and should all who are in earth and heaven war against him, God would verily make him victorious over them, as a manifestation of His power and an expression of His sovereignty. Thus hath the might of thy Lord encompassed the worlds.\"\n\nAnd since in everything can be seen the attributes of all things, therefore upon a single one is conferred the decree of all. And this is the mystery of that which was formerly inspired in the Manifestation of My Self: \"Whoso quickeneth a soul is as though he had quickened all mankind.\" For since all that is in the world existeth in a single soul, He therefore saith that if someone giveth life to a soul it is as though he had given life to all mankind, and if someone killeth a soul it is as though he had killed all the world. Ponder then on this, O ye who are endowed with insight!\n\nLikewise observe with the same vision regarding the idolaters, but in these souls what hath been mentioned appeareth as, for instance, the heaven of denial \\[...\\]\n\nAnd likewise observe the polytheists with this same sight, but in these souls what hath been mentioned shall be seen manifest: for instance, the heaven of turning away, the earth of rancor, the trees of hatred, the branches of envy, the boughs of pride, the leaves of tyranny and the flowers of lewdness. Thus have We set forth the details for you in a chosen tongue, that perchance ye may immerse yourselves in the oceans of divine wisdom and knowledge, and, taking fast hold of the Most Glorious Ark which saileth today upon the sea of grandeur, be numbered among those who have attained thereunto. How well will it be with you if ye be not among the deprived ones.\n\nSay: O ye that are veiled from My Beauty! I swear by the Sovereign Lord of My majesty and glory that this Sun, dawning from the horizon of sublime oneness, shall not remain concealed behind the clouds of rancor nor be obscured by the veils of hatred. At all times doth it shine resplendent at its zenith, calling out with melancholy, enchanting tones: O servants! Deprive not yourselves of the rays of this manifest Sun, nor withhold yourselves from the divine eternal sanctuary. This is God's sanctuary in your midst, this is the Merciful's abode that moveth and walketh among the peoples of the world in human temple. This is the desire of all worlds, the sacred place of divine unity, the holy station of detachment, and the sanctuary of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Peerless, made manifest and visible amongst creation. All the near ones have given their lives for this Day, while ye, O veiled ones, have occupied yourselves with this and that, remaining far from the divine presence. Alas for you, O company of the heedless!\n\nI swear by God that whatsoever hath befallen and continueth to befall the Manifestations of Divine Unity hath been due to the veiling of the people. Consider, for instance, My first manifestation when I appeared between heaven and earth by the name of 'Ali, the All-Knowing, and rent asunder the veils. The divines of that age were the first to arise in rejection and protest. Though outwardly their rejection caused the people to turn away, in reality it was the people who caused these divines to turn away. Observe that had the people not made their acceptance conditional upon the approval of the divines of Najaf and elsewhere, and had they believed in God directly, no opportunity for rejection would have remained for these divines. When they saw themselves bereft of followers and alone, they would surely have hastened to the holy divine court and inevitably attained the fountain of ancient grace.\n\nAnd now too, if the people of the Bayan would sanctify themselves from attachment to their leaders, they would certainly not be deprived, on the Day of God, of the wine of divine meanings and the bounty of the clouds of the All-Merciful's mercy. Through My Name, rend asunder the thick veils and shatter the idols of blind imitation through the power of unity, and enter the holy paradise of the All-Merciful's good-pleasure. Purify your souls from all that is not of God and find repose in the mighty sanctuary of security and the exalted refuge of infallibility. Veil not yourselves with the veil of self, for I have created each soul complete that the perfection of My handiwork might be made manifest. Thus every soul is, in itself, capable of perceiving the Divine Beauty, and ever shall be. For were any soul incapable of this station, no obligation would rest upon it, and if in the Most Great Gathering before God, a soul were asked: \"Why didst thou not believe in My Beauty and turn away from My Self?\" and if that soul should cling to all the peoples of the world and respond: \"Since no one turned unto Thee and I saw all in rejection, I therefore followed their example and remained far from Thine eternal Beauty\" - such an excuse would never be accepted or heard. For the faith of no soul hath ever been, nor ever shall be, dependent upon another. This is one of the mysteries of revelation which I have sent down in all heavenly Books with the Tongue of Power and recorded with the Pen of Might. Now ponder this a while, that with your outward eye \\[...\\]\n\nThis will never be. This is among the mysteries of revelation which I have sent down in all heavenly books with the exalted tongue of power and inscribed with the pen of might. Therefore ponder now awhile, that with your outer and inner sight you may behold and comprehend the subtle wisdoms and the gems of celestial traces which I have revealed in this eternal and sublime Tablet through decisive and irrevocable utterance. And distance not yourselves from the ultimate abode and the divine Lote-Tree and the dwelling place of resplendent glory. The signs of Truth shine forth like the sun among the signs of His servants, and none of His qualities can ever be confused with another. From the dawning-place of His knowledge do the suns of knowledge and meaning rise, and from the paradise of His ink are the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted. Well is it with them that perceive.\n\nO brothers! I swear by the Beauty of the All-Merciful that were it not for observing a limited few who have arisen and, with utmost effort and striving, stand ready to cut down the Divine Lote-Tree, never would I have opened My tongue in utterance nor spoken a word. But what am I to do when these few unworthy and immature ones, clinging to the cord of leadership and grasping at worldly ornaments, prevent people with perfect scheming and utter deceit from approaching the shore of eternity? They have had and have no purpose save to raise up a group like the People of the Furqan in the land, lest any harm befall their leadership. Such is the state of these servants. And since they have observed that the lights of the Ancient Holy Sun have encompassed all worlds and the banners of mighty remembrance have been raised and become renowned in all lands, they have therefore risen in deception and attributed false and unworthy calumnies, that perchance through these falsehoods they might prevent people from attaining the presence of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes. They are occupied with utter delusions, and soon will the greatest shrieking be raised among the people and veils of fancy encompass souls. Therefore, take refuge in God on such a day and observe this Tablet in certain times, that perchance the divine fragrances wafting from this glorious Tablet may protect thee from the darkened winds of hatred and keep thee steadfast on the path of love for the Beloved. In brief, seek not attachment to any leader, and let no turban or staff prevent thee from the outpourings of the Most Glorious Cloud, for human excellence has never been and will never be in garments and names. If any among the turbaned ones have become illumined by the dawning manifestations of the Sun, their names are mentioned with thy Lord; otherwise they have never been and will never be mentioned. Therefore, hearken to My most wondrous and exalted melody. If human excellence were in the turban, then that camel which bears a thousand turbans should be counted among the most learned of people - yet thou seest it is but an animal seeking grass. Beware lest thou be debarred from the Truth by the manifestations of names and temples who adorn themselves with outward turbans and ascetic garments, and be not heedless. Today the Kingdom of Names circles round the Tree of the Cause, created by a single word. Moreover, the asceticism that is beloved of God has been and will ever be turning to God and turning away from all else, not like these servants who, heedless of God and occupied without Him, are content and call this asceticism. Evil is that wherewith they are occupied; soon shall they know. I shall cause one melody from My former melodies to shine forth purely for the sake of God upon thee and the people of the earth from the Dawning-place of utterance, that perchance it may awaken those sleeping in the bed of heedlessness and make them aware of the spiritual breezes that blow from the horizon of My luminous morn. And it is this: The Primal Point - may the spirit of all in the kingdom be sacrificed for Him - wrote to Muhammad Hasan Najafi, who was considered one of the great divines and eminent religious leaders, the substance of which is mentioned in eloquent Persian thus: \"We have raised up Ali from his resting-place \\[...\\]\"\n\nWe sent forth Ali from his resting place and dispatched him unto thee with a perspicuous Tablet. Had thou recognized him and prostrated thyself before him, it would have been better than seventy years of worship thou hast rendered. From thy first letter We would have raised up Muhammad the Messenger of God, and from thy second letter the third letter who is Imam Hassan. But thou remainedst veiled from this station, and We bestowed Our grace upon him who was worthy.\n\nConsider now the greatness of this Cause, how magnificent and momentous it is. The Ali who was sent to the aforementioned Sheikh was Mulla Ali Bastami. Moreover, reflect upon the power of the Manifestation of God, who with but a single letter from the name of His servants can, should He wish, create and raise up all the temples of unity and manifestations of eternity. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the All-Encompassing.\n\nYet now the leaders of the Bayan seek to establish a system of successorship, and through these ancient traditions deprive the people of the fountain of divine glory. Meanwhile the Primal Point, My previous Manifestation, erased all such mentions from the Bayan, and naught was seen or shall be seen save the mention of Mirrors, and even that was not specific or limited, as He says: \"O my God! Raise up in every year a Mirror, and in every month a Mirror, nay in every day and every moment manifest a Mirror that will reflect Thee.\" This bounty exists in the Mirrors so long as they remain turned toward the Sun of Truth; after turning away, all is lost and unmentioned.\n\nBy God! Today the Mirrors remain veiled - nay more, even the followers of the Torah are thunderstruck. Consider the Ahsanu'l-Qisas, known as the Qayyumu'l-Asma, and the Persian Bayan which contains the subtle divine utterances, that all mysteries may become evident. These words are mentioned for the weak ones; otherwise, those who dwell in the station of \"Know God through God\" and who abide in the holy sanctuary of \"He cannot be known through aught else\" recognize Truth through His own Self and through what appears from Him. Though all in the heavens and earth be filled with decisive verses and firm utterances, they pay no heed nor seek to hold fast to them, for clinging to words is only justified when their Revealer is not present.\n\nExalted be this Beauty whose light hath encompassed the worlds! This heart is too grief-stricken to reveal hidden pearls or incline toward speech, for the Cause of God is being squandered, and the labors of this servant have been scattered to the winds of oblivion by one who was himself created by His word. Though such matters truly lead to the maturity of people, since most are weak and immature they remain veiled. Yet thy Lord is indeed independent of such as these, and He encompasses all worlds.\n\nBe not content to be like the people of the Furqan, who cling to names \\[...\\]\n\nBe not content to be like the people of the Qur'an who cling to names while remaining veiled from the Source of Names, who recite words while depriving themselves of Him Who is their Revealer and Source. For if, on this Day, all who are in the heavens and on earth were to become refined mirrors and lofty, impregnable, and inaccessible crystals, and were to arise to worship as did those of old, yet hesitate for less than a moment in this wondrous Cause, they would be regarded as utter nothingness in the sight of God and be mentioned as absolute non-existence. Have you not observed that all the mentions of the people of the Qur'an were pure falsehood, and at the time of the Manifestation, none benefited from that to which they had clung, except those who entered the religion of the Lord of the Worlds through the power of certitude? Therefore, hearken unto the divine melody and the glorious, eternal utterance, and say: In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious, and by His Most Exalted, Most Impregnable, Most Holy, Most High Permission. Enter through the gate of the Ridvan Garden into the very heart of the City, that thou mayest witness thyself enriched through the riches of thy Lord, speaking in praise of thy Creator, knowing the Self of thy Master, and finding that which will solace thine eyes, gladden thy being, bring joy to thine essence, and number thee among the triumphant. This is the counsel of the Ancient Beauty to His loved ones. Whosoever wishes, let him believe, and whosoever wishes, let him turn away. And if thou attainest unto that which hath been mentioned and art honored with the presence of the Beauty of the All-Merciful, then stand firm in His Cause and cry out among the servants, and with Our sweetest melodies proclaim between the heavens and the earth: \"O people of the Bayan! By the True One! The Sun of Knowledge hath risen from the horizon of glory and hath dawned from the chambers of the Ridvan Garden - this Youth, upon Whose countenance shineth the radiance of the All-Bountiful, in Whose hand is the Wine of Life, and Who giveth drink to all created things in My Most Glorious Name, this crimson Wine. Therefore hasten, O people of creation, O manifestations of names, that the hidden pearls may be revealed unto you from this treasured Cup which hath appeared in the form of the Tablet. Drink ye therefrom, as have the denizens of the highest paradise in their most exalted habitations. And when they drank, they were seized by the raptures of the All-Merciful and the breezes of the All-Glorious, and they spoke in the heights of Paradise with songs of joy: 'By God! This is indeed the sealed wine! By the True One! This is the wine that was hidden beneath the veils of the unseen and preserved beneath the pavilion of glory, touched by the fingers of the All-Merciful on the throne of Paradise, and manifested through grace by this Name which hath appeared in truth and from Whose face have shone wondrous lights both secretly and openly, whereby the eyes of those near unto God were solaced, then the eyes of the Messengers, then all that was and will be.' O people of the Bayan! Deprive not yourselves of the vision of the All-Merciful. Break the idols of vain desire through My Most Glorious Name, then draw forth the sword of utterance from the scabbard of the tongue and sing with the sweetest melodies among the people of creation, that perchance men might become aware within themselves and emerge from behind a limited veil. Say: Do ye imagine within yourselves that this Youth speaketh from desire? Nay, by His Most Glorious Beauty! Rather, He standeth at the Most Exalted Horizon and speaketh that which the Most Great Spirit hath spoken within His most pure and crystal heart. By the True One! The Mighty One hath taught Him in the highest empyrean, and the Powerful Spirit hath acquainted Him in the most sublime Kingdom, and He speaketh the truth at all times with that which the Tongue of Command hath spoken in the most hidden pavilion. By God! This is He Who appeared once by the name of the Spirit, then by the name of the Beloved, then by the name of Ali, then by this Blessed, Transcendent, All-Compelling, Sublime, Beloved Name.\"\n\nHe speaketh the truth at all times according to what the Tongue of Command hath spoken in the Most Hidden Pavilion. By God, this is He Who appeared once by the name of the Spirit, then by the name of the Beloved, then by the name of Ali, and then by this blessed, exalted, transcendent, sublime, and beloved Name. And verily this is Husayn Who hath appeared in truth through grace in the heaven of justice, and the polytheists rose against Him with their tyranny and wickedness, then severed His head with the sword of hatred and raised it upon a spear between earth and heaven. Then the head spoke from atop the spear: \"O gathering of shadows! Be ashamed before My beauty, then before My power, My sovereignty and My grandeur. Turn your gaze toward the countenance of your Chosen Lord, that ye may find Me crying out among you with holy, beloved melodies. Be fair then within yourselves - would ye deprive yourselves of the Most Exalted Sanctuary and this Most Pure, Most Wise, Crimson House? Toward what sanctuary do ye turn and around which do ye circle? Fear God, then open your eyes, that ye may perchance behold God's glances above your heads and His Kingdom before your faces, that ye may perchance become aware within yourselves and be among those who understand.\"\n\nO Nasir! We loved thee before and We love thee now, that thou mayest stand firm in thy love for thy Lord. We have sent thee that which sufficeth as proof for the East and West of the earth, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of them that are gladdened by the glad-tidings of the Spirit. When this Tablet reacheth thee, arise from thy seat, then place it upon thy head, then turn thy face toward My shining, mighty, and self-subsisting countenance and say:\n\nO Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having sent down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which purifieth the worlds. O Lord! Thanks be unto Thee for having shed upon me the lights of the Sun of Thy countenance, by Whose dawning the two worlds were created. O Lord! Praise be unto Thee for Thy wondrous gifts and beauteous bestowals. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Beauty in this blessed, luminous, Most Glorious Garment to cut me off from every remembrance save Thy remembrance and from every praise save Thy praise. Then inspire me with that which will establish me in Thy good-pleasure and prevent me from turning toward the worlds. O Lord! I am he who hath been neglectful in Thy Cause. Grant me, by the sovereignty of Thy grace, and leave me not to myself for less than a moment. O Lord! Drive me not from the gate of Thy mighty oneness and the courtyard of Thy holy unity. Then send down upon me that which is beloved by Thee, for Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Generous. O Lord! Send upon me the breezes of forgiveness from the direction of Thy Most Glorious Name, then raise me unto the pole of paradise, the seat of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Then forgive me and my father and her who bore me, by Thy grace and mercy, for Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. O Lord! Ordain for me what Thou chooseth for myself, then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty from the wonders of Thy generosity and favor. Then fulfill my needs from Thy presence, for Thou art the best fulfiller, the best judge, and the best ordainer, and Thou art the Ancient Bestower.\n\nThen after that, gird up thy loins to serve God and His Cause, and aid it with whatsoever thou art able. Neither deny within thyself, nor withhold the words of God from the eyes of the servants. Rather, spread them before the believers. Beware lest the name of anyone or the customs of any soul prevent thee. Convey the Cause of thy Lord to those who are there, and tarry not in what thou art commanded. Be thou steadfast in this wondrous Cause. First counsel thyself, then counsel others. This is what We have ordained for Our sincere servants. Be thou so firm in thy love for thy Lord that nothing shall cause thee to slip from His path. This is of My bounty unto thee and unto My beneficent servants. Know thou that there will come before thee one who would prevent thee from the love of God. When thou perceivest from him the odors of hatred for the Beauty of Glory, be assured that he is Satan himself, even if he be among the most exalted of men. Then shun him and seek refuge in My Name, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Thus have We informed thee of the hidden tidings that thou mayest become aware of that which is concealed from the eyes of all creation. O Nasir! Avoid such as these, then flee from them to the shadow of thy Lord's protection and be in mighty safekeeping. Know thou that the very breath of such people hath an effect like unto the effect of a serpent's breath, if thou be of them that understand. Thus have We inspired thee and taught thee that which was hidden from thee, that thou mayest become aware of God's purpose and be illumined with clear vision. Cleanse thy hands from clinging to aught else but God or pointing to any besides Him. Thus doth the Ancient Pen command thee, if thou be of them that hearken. Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, the Truth, there shall come upon you the thunderbolts of the Day of Wrath, then the earthquakes of grievous days, then the blowing of a devastating wind, and there shall come unto you the Embodiment of Fire with a Book wherein is a refutation against God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have ordained for every believer that, should he become aware of this and find it within his power, he should take up the Pen of Might in the name of his Lord, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, and write in refutation of him who hath denied God. Thus doth thy Lord requite the idolaters. By God, the Truth, We took dust and kneaded it with the waters of the Cause, and We formed from it a mortal and adorned him with the shirt of names among the worlds. But when We raised his mention and made his name renowned among the concourse of names, he then arose in opposition and warred against My Self, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and pronounced sentence of death against Him through Whose remembrance the heavens and earth were created. When We found him in such a state, We concealed it within Ourselves and departed from among these people and sat alone in the house, trusting in God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Ancient. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee that thou mayest become aware of that which is hidden and be illumined with clear vision. Purify thy sight from such as these, then turn thy gaze to the Most Great Scene, the seat of the Throne, the dawning-place of thy Lord's beauty, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, that He may protect thee from the arrows of allusions and make thee eloquent in His praise among the worlds. Arise then to remember God and His Cause, and remind those who have believed in God Who created them and fashioned them. Then impart unto them what We have imparted unto thee in this Tablet, that they may be among them that remember. And likewise unto those of thy household who have believed in God and His signs, whether female or male, whether young or old. And praise be to My Self, the Supreme, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Ancient. By God, this word at the end of the utterance is God's sword against the idolaters and His mercy unto them that believe in His unity.\n\nIt was mentioned that you would always send a gift with your letter to the sacred threshold, and now due to apparent lack of means you have been deprived of this bounty. Never be saddened by this and do not grieve. By God, the Truth, your love for Me is better than the treasures of the heavens and earth if you remain firm in it. Thus has the Command been sent down from the heaven of wondrous glory. Do not sorrow over this, for all good is in His hands. He will soon enrich you through His grace when He wishes and wills. Verily no matter exists except after His leave. His is the creation and the command. He ordains what He pleases, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And verily if your love is purified from the allusions \\[of this world\\], God will make it an imperishable treasure, a garment that will not wear out, stores that will not be concealed, a glory that will not be veiled, and an honor that will not be obscured. Thus has the Tongue of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, moved so that you may find tranquility in your soul, rejoice in your being, and be among the patient and the trusting ones.\n\n\\[Phrases within brackets that have been effaced in the original Tablet are from the copy...\\]\n\n=== END BH00049 ===\n\n=== START BH00050 ===\n\n0\n\nIn the Name of the Wronged One, Who is manifest in the Most Great Prison! This is a Book from which the trees perceive the fragrance of spring, and children catch the loving scent of their gracious Father, and the thirsty hear the murmur of the Water of Life, and those near unto God inhale the breath of the All-Merciful, and the sincere behold the lights of Beauty, and lovers discern the signs of nearness and reunion. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Ancient Beauty walked in the palace which God made the seat of His mighty throne.\n\nO My Name! Bear thou witness as God hath borne witness that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Go forth with the Book of God and His tokens to His lands, and remind therein My loved ones of this Day which was remembered in the hearts of the Prophets and inscribed in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers. Say: Beware lest the veils of the people of the Bayan keep you from God, the Lord of all worlds. We counseled them concerning the Most Great Manifestation, and commanded them to do what is right, and gave them glad tidings of this glorious and wondrous Day. Yet when the Hidden was revealed and the Sealed Wine was unsealed, they denied and turned away from Him Who came with manifest sovereignty.\n\nO My Name, O thou who hast drunk the wine of My utterance! Say: O people of the Bayan, remember, then observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\" Say: O company of the heedless, fear God and oppose not Him through Whom the banner of divine knowledge hath been raised to the highest station of possibility, and through Whom the ocean of utterance hath surged and the sweet savors of the All-Merciful have wafted. Be fair and be not of the wrongdoers.\n\nO Mahdi! Say: Verily, he whom ye have taken as lord besides God was fleeing from place to place. To this beareth witness the Lord of all beings and every fair-minded and discerning soul.\n\nO My Name! Say: O people of the Bayan! The books of the world profit you not today except through this Book that walketh in the Most Great Prison and proclaimeth before all nations: \"There is none other God but I, the Expliciter, the All-Knowing.\" Say: The Most Glorious Horizon hath appeared and the Supreme Pen hath moved in this Revelation whereby the pavilion of glory hath been raised upon the Luminous Spot, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath been manifested.\n\nO My Name! Say: O company of the heedless! Hearken unto that which the Dove of Utterance warbleth upon the branches, then observe the essence which the Primal Point took from the heavenly Books in His words: \"I have written an essence regarding His remembrance, and it is that He cannot be indicated by My indication nor by what is mentioned in the Bayan.\" Fear ye the All-Merciful and deny not Him Who hath come to you from the Dawning-Place of knowledge with a clear proof.\n\nSay: That which is with the people will not suffice you today. Cast away vain imaginings and turn unto the Manifestation of God's Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is the Day whose covenant We took from every Prophet and every holy one, were ye of those who know. Beware lest the greatest veil prevent you from the Lord of Destiny. Purify your hearts with the Kawthar of your Lord's utterance, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Sanctify the mirrors of your hearts that there may be reflected therein \"The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nSay: Come, let us set aside what the people possess and judge fairly concerning that which hath shone forth from the horizon of God's knowledge, the One, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: If ye desire verses, they have indeed encompassed the horizons, and if ye seek clear proofs, they have appeared in such wise that none deny them save every transgressor, sinful one. Say: By God! I have arisen with the Cause on a Day wherein eyes were dazed and feet did slip through fear of those who were on a mighty side of wrongdoing. Fear ye God and be not of the transgressors.\n\n1\n\nO My Name and he who walks by My leave! Mention unto My chosen ones and My loved ones that which hath been manifested in the Land of Sirr through God's power and sovereignty, when He rose above the horizon of the House, speaking forth the verses of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beauteous. By God! The Bayan was sent down for My remembrance, and it is but a leaf from among the leaves of the Tree of My utterance. To this testifieth My Herald, who laid down His life in My straight and manifest path. Say: O heedless ones! Take heed lest the Bayan withhold you from your Lord, the All-Merciful. By God's life! It was sent down to bear witness unto Me. Read ye what is therein and be of the fair-minded. Say: By God! He Who conversed with the Burning Bush speaketh, yet ye perceive not. He is the One promised by the tongue of the Prophets. Fear ye God and dispute not the signs of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: This is the Day wherein the Ocean proclaimeth: \"Blessed art thou, O Land, for the breezes of God, the Mighty, the Great, have wafted over thee.\" Thou hast discovered the fragrances of the days and the sweet-scented perfume of thy Lord's garment when He appeared with His blessed Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. And the Land proclaimeth, saying: \"Blessed art thou, O Ocean, for God's Ark, the Lord of all worlds, hath sailed upon thee.\"\n\nO My loved ones in all lands! Rejoice in that God hath singled you out for the recognition of the Dayspring of His Cause and hath preserved you from the Great Terror that hath seized all people, save whom God willeth, the Strong, the Almighty, the Powerful. Ye have attained unto that which none else hath attained. To this bear witness the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and they who possess the Manifest Book.\n\nO My Name! Remind My servants and give them the glad tidings of My mercy and My favor. Then recite unto them what hath been sent down from the kingdom of Mine wondrous utterance. Say: The use of opium hath been forbidden unto you in God's Book, the All-Commanding, the All-Wise. It harmeth you and benefiteth you not. This is what ye have been commanded, both before and after, through clear verses and manifest proofs. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with that which he hath been commanded by God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nPass through the lands with the fragrances of thy Lord's garment of utterance and give His loved ones therein the glad tidings of this Remembrance through which that which was hidden in a preserved Tablet hath been revealed. Take the rights of God by Our leave, then act in accordance with what We have commanded thee. Verily thy Lord is He Who commandeth whatsoever He willeth. The might of the mighty weakeneth Him not, nor do the doings of the heedless frustrate Him.\n\nShould thou arrive in the land of Alif and Ra, convey My greetings unto My loved ones and illumine them with the lights of the Sun of My tender mercy, and remind them of this News through which this lofty Structure hath been raised. Say: Give thanks, for My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken in remembrance of you, and My Most Glorious Countenance hath turned toward you, and the tongue of My bounty hath sent down from the kingdom of Mine utterance that which, were it to be placed upon the mountains, would cause them to soar with longing for the meeting of the Lord of Causes, Who hath come with a sovereignty that the veils of idle fancies and the clouds of vain imaginings have not prevented. Say: He hath come with God's proof and His evidence, and He is the Path of God for all who are in the heavens and on earth, did ye but know.\n\nAnd We make mention of the Imam therein who emigrated in My path and drew near until he attained unto Our presence, when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra, and he drank the wine of reunion from the hands of My bounty and stood before My gate which was opened unto all in the seen and the unseen. We bear witness that he heard the Call and answered his Lord, the Lord of what was and what shall be\\[...\\]\n\n2\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar! Remind mankind of that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen. Say: Fear God, and deny not Him Who enjoineth upon you what is virtuous and forbiddeth you that which ye were forbidden in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. It behooveth you to make good what hath escaped you in His days. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which He Who speaketh at the mid-most heart of the world commandeth you. There is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Say: If God were to chastise anyone for having believed in this Revelation, by what proof would He not chastise those who believed in the Point of the Bayan, and before Him in Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before Him in the Son of Mary, and before Him in Moses the Interlocutor, until the matter returneth to the Primal Beginning. Fear ye God, and follow not the idols who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed. Whoso halteth in this Cause hath halted in every Cause that hath been manifested by God's will and purpose, would ye but know. Say: Naught is seen in the Word but its Speaker, nor in the Manifestation but the Beauty of Him Who is manifested, nor in the Revelation save the Revealer, Who domineth all created things through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of the people of Mim and Ra from the presence of the Lord of Names, and give them glad tidings of God's bounty, the Lord of all worlds. Say: We make mention of you in the Most Great Prison with that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. O My loved ones in all lands and regions! Rejoice that the countenance of God hath turned towards you and giveth you glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for you by the Most Exalted Pen in a Tablet wherein He hath spoken: There is none other God but He, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Blessed are they who have ascended unto God, and those upon whom there hath descended from the daysprings of tyranny that which hath caused the most exalted Paradise and the dawning-places of My most beauteous names to lament. Upon them rest My glory, My mercy, My bounty and My grace which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: We have sent down for you that which hath brought joy to the eyes of the Concourse on high. Rejoice, then give thanks for this manifest bounty. Beware lest the world and what appeareth therein grieve you. By the True One! The ocean of joy hath surged before the face of Him Who conversed upon Sinai. Draw nigh with radiant hearts unto the most exalted horizon. This is better for you, did ye but know. Verily, those who have martyred themselves in My path are the denizens of the pavilion of My glory and the tabernacles of My grandeur. The people of My Kingdom and My Dominion, and the Manifestations of My names, and the Daysprings of My attributes, and the Repositories of My knowledge, the All-Glorious, the All-Encompassing, offer prayers for them.\n\n3\n\nO My Name! Associate with the loved ones of the All-Merciful with spirit and joy, and remind them of that which will attract their hearts in this Day which God hath made the sovereign of days in a preserved Tablet. We have remembered thee, exalted thee, caused thee to hear and shown thee. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the mystics and the Object of worship of the sincere ones.\" We have permitted thee to grant permission unto whosoever desireth to attain the presence of thy Lord. This is yet another bounty bestowed upon thee from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Thus hath the sun of grace shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness, and I am verily the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nHe who seeketh to attain the ultimate goal and to enter the presence of the Lord of all beings must follow that which the Supreme Pen hath ordained from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He forbiddeth you to bow down and prostrate yourselves at My feet and the feet of others. This is what hath been revealed in the Book from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! If ye desire to attain His presence, then present yourselves with spirit and joy, with the manners that befit human nature. Fear God and be not of the heedless. He ordaineth as He pleaseth and commandeth that which guideth the servants unto this Most Great Light, before which, when it appeared, the Faithful Spirit prostrated itself. Kiss not the hands and bow not down at the time of arrival. He commandeth you to observe what is right, and He is the Commander, the All-Responding. None should abase himself before another soul. This is the decree of God as He established Himself upon the throne with manifest sovereignty.\n\nForbidden unto you is that which We have mentioned. Take ye the laws and commandments of God and follow not the ways of the ignorant. Whoso attaineth the presence of the Face is accounted among the visitors in the sight of God, the Lord of this noble station. Whoso attaineth hath visited, and he is of them that have attained to what was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Forbidden unto you is kissing of hands, prostration, casting oneself down and bowing. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them down as a grace from Our presence, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.\n\nProstration beseemeth him who knoweth not and seeth not. But he who seeth is among those unto whom the Clear Book hath testified. None should prostrate before him, and whoso hath prostrated before him should return and repent unto God. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. It hath been proven through clear evidence that prostration is due only to the Unseen Presence. Know this, O people of the earth, and be not of them that turn aside. Say: O people, cast away your principles and adopt the principles of God through His might, and follow not every dubious learned one. Beware lest ye object to Him Who hath come unto you with clear signs, and beware lest ye deny this Great Announcement, before which, when it appeared, every great announcement bowed down in submission.\n\nThe Wronged One desireth to make mention of the land of Ba and Nun which was honored by the arrival of His loved ones who fulfilled His firm and mighty Covenant. Blessed are they who were martyred therein through the deeds wrought by the hands of every tyrannical oppressor. Happy is he who attained martyrdom in My days and spent what he possessed in My love and bore witness to that which the tongue of My grandeur testified in the most exalted station. Glad tidings unto him who hath arisen to serve My Cause of the loving-kindness of God and His grace which hath encompassed the horizons.\n\n4\n\nWe make mention of the Trustworthy One who took the cup of tribulation and adversity in the path of God, the Lord of all names, until he drank therefrom through this Name before which all necks have bowed down in submission. O Amin! We testify that thou didst stand firm in My service, wert vocal in My remembrance, and remained patient in all that befell thee on this Path. Thou art he who clung to the Will and Purpose of God, forsaking the desires of every covenant-breaking infidel. Rejoice in that We have made mention of thee in numerous Tablets and in a Scripture which none save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath seen. We have made thee a star shining from the horizon of this heaven and a letter from the Book of God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nO My Name! Gladden the people of Baha in other lands on behalf of God, the Lord of all men. Then bid them to that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of creation, may be exalted. Say: Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. By the life of God! These are mightier than all the hosts of earth combined, as attesteth He Who beareth witness that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. Hold fast unto the cord of unity in all conditions, that there may be manifested from you that which God, the Lord of the worlds, hath purposed. We have servants in those regions whose names We have withheld lest they become known to every oppressor who hath denied the right of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\n\nWe make mention of My loved ones in the land of Ta and give them glad-tidings of God's bounty, His favor and His mercy which have preceded both the unseen and the visible. Say: Blessed are ye for having inhaled the fragrance of the verses and for having attained unto the sweet savors of the days of God, the Mighty, the Loving. We counsel you to fear God and to that whereby His Cause may be exalted. Verily, He heareth and seeth; He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: Beware lest love of the world hold you back from the Lord of all men. Abandon that which is on earth, then hearken unto that which calleth you from the Divine Lote-Tree on the gleaming spot of the sacred and luminous earth. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Manifest, the Speaking One, Who doeth whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nWe have turned toward you at this time and make mention of you with that which shall never lose its fragrance throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly dominion. Abandon that which extinguisheth the fire of the Cause among men and kindleth the fire of self and desire. Fear God and be not of them who understand not. We beseech God to aid you in that which may exalt His Cause and enable the Divine Lote-Tree to speak forth amidst all creation. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nO loved ones of the All-Merciful! Ye are they who have borne for God's sake the censure of every critic and the malice of those who have disbelieved in God's favor and turned away from Him through Whom those in the graves have been raised up. Blessed is the land illumined by the lights of His countenance and the garden over which hath wafted the breezes of revelation from this glorious station. Hold fast unto that which is good and cleave unto that which profiteth all mankind. Thus have ye been commanded by God, the Lord of the Ancient Days, Who hath guided you to His straight path.\n\nVerily, the Divine Lote-Tree desireth to make mention of the people of Milan who have believed in the All-Merciful on a day wherein the people turned away from God, the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Sufficient. O people of Milan! Hearken unto the call of the Dawning-Place of Light from the Divine Lote-Tree. Verily, He informeth you of that which hath been ordained for you by God, the Lord of existence. We counsel you to that which is praiseworthy and that whereby your stations may be exalted in both the earthly kingdom and the kingdom of heaven. Blessed is the heart that hath turned to My horizon, the tongue that hath uttered this Most Great Remembrance, and the face that hath turned toward the face of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. O people of Milan! Rejoice in your Lord, the All-Merciful. Ye have turned unto Him. Verily, He hath sent down for you that which cannot be equaled by all the treasures and riches.\n\n5\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones in Sisan who have inhaled the fragrance of My utterance and hearkened to My call and have soared in this atmosphere from which can be heard the warbling of the Bird of inner meanings that beareth glad-tidings unto the people of God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. We counsel you to be trustworthy and just and faithful, and to that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be made manifest. They that have oppressed and denied, these are among the wayward in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Blessed are ye, O people of Paradise, by virtue of what the All-Merciful hath testified for you in this exalted station. Verily he who hath turned unto God, the Lord of all creation, is assuredly among the people of the most exalted Paradise in His mighty Book. O My loved ones! Preserve your stations through My Name, whereby hath been manifested that which was recorded in the Scriptures of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO My Name! Hear what God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen and the Lord of the mighty Throne, counseleth thee. Make mention of the people of Za from Me. By the life of God! They are beneath the glances of their Lord's loving-kindness, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Say: Blessed art thou, O Land of Za, for in thee were martyred the friends of God and His chosen ones, through whom was manifested the decree of faithfulness in the world of creation and through whom wafted the fragrance of steadfastness in the kingdom of names. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this station which hath been named by every name by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who remembereth them and who seeketh out and visiteth their resting-places, by virtue of what hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of their Lord, the Revealer of verses.\n\nO My Name! Glorify on My behalf My loved ones there, upon whose faces thou perceivest the radiance of the All-Merciful and from whose deeds is raised the Cause of God, the Lord of all men. O My Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face toward My loved ones in Ra and Shin and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My grace and My loving-kindness, and say: Blessed are ye for having fulfilled My Covenant and My Testament, and for having drunk the choice wine of My utterance, and for having heard in My path the blame of every sinful doubter. We were with you in days wherein was heard the croaking of one who spoke that which caused the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise to lament. Blessed is he who showed patience in God, the Judge of the Day of Reckoning.\n\nWe make mention of him who heard My call and turned to My horizon and arose to serve My Cause and confined all matters to My remembrance and praise, and testified to that which the Tongue of My Cause testified in the tabernacles of My grandeur - he whom We named the Nightingale in the Book of Names - that he may give thanks unto God throughout the nights and days. By the life of God! We have remembered you in such wise that the fragrance thereof shall never cease to endure so long as My most beautiful names endure. To this beareth witness the Most Great Book of God, round which circle the Scriptures and Tablets.\n\nWe make mention of My loved ones in Qaf who were not prevented by the affairs of creation from the Truth and who attained unto the Kawthar of eternity in the earliest days. O My loved ones there! Rejoice in that the Wronged One maketh mention of you in such wise as to attract the hearts of them that are possessed of understanding. Blessed are ye for having rent asunder the veils and for having shattered, with the hands of power and certitude, the idols of vain imaginings and idle fancies. Ye are they that heard and hastened until ye reached the shore of the ocean of utterance - the station wherein the atoms cry out throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven unto Him Who hath appeared with the truth and hath manifested through His sovereignty whatsoever He desired. We have found from you the fragrance of faithfulness. We have sent down for you that which no treasures of the world can equal. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and discerning one.\n\n6\n\nO thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon My countenance! When thou beholdest the darkness of My city, pause and say: O Land of Ta! I have come to thee from the Prison with tidings from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O Mother of the world and Dayspring of Light amidst the nations! I herald unto thee the tender mercy of thy Lord, and upon thee do I pronounce, from before the All-Knowing, the Knower of secrets, the Most Great Name. I bear witness that within thee was revealed the Hidden Name and the Treasured Secret, and through thee was made manifest the mystery of what hath been and what is yet to be. O Land of Ta! The Lord of Names remembereth thee from His glorious station. Thou wert the Dawning-Place of God's Cause, the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Manifestation of His Most Great Name, whereby the hearts and souls were sorely shaken. How many of the oppressed have been martyred within thee in the path of God, and how many a wronged woman lieth buried within thee, at whose fate honoured servants have wept.\n\n7\n\nVerily We make mention of Our loved ones in that place who entered into imprisonment for the sake of God, the Lord of all kings, and We make mention of those who turned to the Most Exalted Horizon in days wherein the fire of hatred blazed in the breasts of those divines who violated God's Covenant and His Testament, and denied God's favor, the Lord of what was and what shall be. And We make mention of the emigrants who fled when the fire of sedition was kindled through that which the hands of every polytheistic disbeliever had wrought. O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not those who have denied the right of God and His chosen ones, and deny not Him Whom ye invoke by night and by day. This is the Day which ye were promised aforetime, and in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. By the life of God! Ye were created for this Day. Recognize it and deprive not yourselves of this grace to which the Tablets have testified. This is the Day wherein the Choice Wine hath appeared and the Salsabil hath flowed and Kawthar hath proclaimed: \"The Promise is fulfilled and mankind hath risen before the Lord of Lords!\" This is the Day wherewith God gave glad tidings to His Prophets and His Messengers. The Mother Book with Him beareth witness to this. Say: O company of the heedless! By God, the Bayan was sent down by My command and its letters are from My Word. Fear God and oppose not Him through Whom the dawn hath breathed and the Balance been established. This is the Day wherein the Trumpet and the Mount circle round the Manifestation, and the Path walketh upon the loftiest horizons of the earth with power and sovereignty. If ye deny God's signs and His proof, by what evidence can ye prove what ye possess? Be fair, O company of oppression! By God the True One, the Bayan lamenteth by reason of your tyranny and declareth: \"Woe unto you for having broken My Covenant and My Testament and for having denied Him about Whom We counseled you at all times.\" God sent Me down to mention Him and made Me a herald of His Name through which the hidden Mystery was revealed and the Fire spoke forth in the Trees. O My Name amongst the rejectors! Among them is he who saith that He hath plagiarized the verses and attributed them to Himself. Say: Present thyself before the Divine Countenance that thou mayest behold what no eye of possibility hath seen. And among them is he who saith that He hath forbidden people from what is right. Say: Woe unto thee, O heedless liar! That which is right circleth round Me and hath appeared through My command, and justice standeth before My face at eventide and at dawn. This is the Day wherein the earth hath spoken and hath shone with the light of its Lord, the Possessor of the Day of Return. O people! Be fair for God's sake! Were it not for the letter B before H, who would arise to uphold the Cause when the limbs of the earth trembled with fear of these days? Ye were behind the veil when the Wronged One called out between earth and heaven. The Manifestations of the Names and He with Whom is the Kingdom of Utterance bear witness to this. Ye were asleep behind the curtains while My Most Exalted Pen moved in the arena of wisdom and knowledge. We opened the gate of counsel before your faces when We found you to be the most wretched of servants in deeds. Ye have done what ye were forbidden and abandoned what ye were commanded in the Book. We testify that ye have cast God's laws behind your backs and taken what ye were commanded by your base desires and passions, without any clear proof or evidence. Verily We saw you in the darkness of your lusts. We held fast to the cord of counsel to such an extent that the scratching of My pen ceased not by night and by day, at eventide and at dawn. O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and lean not upon him who cast God's Covenant behind his back and pronounced judgment against Him Who reared him with the hands of grace in spirit and joy. When God's Cause was exalted to a certain degree, We found him like unto a spotted snake, creeping and hissing behind Us. Thus was the matter decreed in days wherein the pillars were shaken.\n\n8\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones in Qaf and Mim, and of him who hath set his face towards the All-Highest Companion and the Ultimate Goal, that it may be a light unto him in every world of the worlds of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. O ?adiq! The Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee from the Most Great Prison, when sorrows have encompassed Him from all sides through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We counsel those whom God hath related unto thee to be patient and forbearing, and We comfort them with this remembrance whereby the eyes of them that are nigh unto God have been solaced. We make mention of the two brothers who have arisen to serve the Cause, and of those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Supreme Horizon on a day wherein the feet of the mystics have slipped. And We make mention of the people of Kaf, whom the censure of any censurer hath not deterred in the path of God, and whom the hosts of the heedless have not frightened. They arose and declared: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\" O My loved ones in that place and its surroundings! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He counseleth you to preserve that which ye have been given by God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest ye forfeit your stations and that which hath befallen you in the path of God, the Exalted, the Great. Ye have witnessed for the sake of God that which hath caused the Supreme Pen to lament. Soon shall ye behold that which shall gladden your hearts, O people of Baha. Thus doth God give you glad-tidings as a token of His grace, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. There hath been sent down for you in the Book that before which the treasures of the world and all that the kings and rulers pride themselves upon are as naught. Take ye the chalice of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of your Lord, the Lord of Names. This is what the Wronged One hath commanded you, both before and after, if ye be of them that comprehend.\n\nO thou who bearest My Name and gazeth upon My countenance! When thou beholdest the whiteness of the city wherein the Sun of fidelity hath set, pause and say: O Land of ?ad! Where are the daysprings of thy light and the dawning-places of thy glory? Where is the ornament of thy temple, and where are they through whom the horizons of guidance were illumined amongst all creatures? Where are the words of the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised? O Land of ?ad! Where are thy standards and thy signs, thy evidences and thy banners? Have the traces of injustice been erased from thee, and will it be as it was before? Tell me, and be not of the patient ones. Doth the serpent still hiss within thee, and doth the wolf still howl as it howled before? Verily thy Lord doth ask and answer, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. We bear witness that within thee were treasured the treasures of fidelity, and the crimson Ark was sunk, and the She-Camel of God, the Lord of the worlds, was hamstrung. The suns of love and fidelity have set from thy horizons through that which the hands of them that disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Invincible, have wrought. Say: O Land of ?ad! We counsel thee regarding My trust and My trusts, and We ask thee concerning the fire of hatred - hath it been extinguished, or can its burning and its flames still be seen? Tell Me truly, for the sake of God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.\n\n9\n\nO My Name! O thou who speaketh My remembrance! Know thou that whosoever desireth to be illumined by the light of eternity and to be honored by visiting any of the people of Baha who are established upon the Crimson Ark and are turned toward the Supreme Horizon, it behooveth him to cleanse his heart with the water of detachment and sanctify his face from turning to whatsoever hath been created in existence and brought into being, and to be in such wise that he seeth the Kingdom before his face and all else behind him. Then let him walk with the dignity and tranquility of God, and in every step let him say with the essence of submissiveness and the utmost lowliness: \"O my God! I have intended those who shed their blood in Thy path and sacrificed their souls in Thy love,\" until he reacheth the most holy sepulcher and sacred dust. Let him stand and look to the right like one who awaiteth the mercy of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Then let him turn and say:\n\n\"The first ray that dawned from the horizon of grace, and the first fragrance that wafted from the garment of the countenance of His Holiness the Ancient King, and the first word uttered by the tongue of the Divine Will in the world, and the first light whereby the hearts of the nations were attracted - upon you, O Temples of Glory and Daysprings of Names and Dawning-places of the Command in the Kingdom of creation! I testify that through you the All-Merciful was established upon the throne of possibility, and the ocean of forgiveness surged, and the Kawthar of life overflowed, and the Kingdom of utterance appeared, and from its horizon the sun of knowledge shone forth. Ye are they through whose will the Will and its sovereignty appeared, and the Purpose and its power emerged, and Destiny and what was ordained therein by God, the Powerful, the Mighty. Through you the Word encompassed all things and the breeze wafted, and the world was illumined by the manifestations of the light that rose and shone forth from the Dayspring of the light of Oneness. Indeed, through you the dove of faithfulness cooed in the Supreme Paradise, and the Lote-Tree of the extremity spoke, and the nightingale of glory sang, and all things proclaimed that which God, your Creator and your Sovereign, your Origin and your Maker, your Quickener and your Slayer, your First and your Last, your Manifester and your Inspirer, your Strengthener and your Identifier, hath testified.\n\n\"Ye are the letters of the Primal Word and the first adorning in the Kingdom of creation, and the manifestations of justice in the Supreme Heaven. Ye are the Book inscribed, and the Symbol witnessed, and the Scroll outspread, and the House frequented. Through you were raised the banners of justice and planted the standards of triumph, and through you the fragrance of the garment was diffused and the sign of sanctification appeared, and through you the door of bounty was opened before the face of all nations and from the clouds of knowledge rained down the showers of the All-Merciful's grace. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who draweth nigh unto God through you and who holdeth fast to your hems and cleaveth to your cords and uttereth your remembrance. And woe unto him who denieth your right and turneth away from you and showeth pride toward you and rejecteth God's favor in you. Every thing beareth witness to your glory and the loftiness of your station and your profit in the hereafter and the first life, and to the loss of those who disbelieved in God when He came with shining signs and clear proofs and brilliant lights.\"\n\n10\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the believers have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and presence, and the sincere ones have hastened to the place of sacrifice in Thy love and good-pleasure! I beseech Thee by those who have been martyred in Thy path and were so attracted by Thy verses that nothing in the world prevented them from drawing nigh unto Thee, to ordain for us through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will benefit us in this world and the next. O my God, my Lord and my Hope! I implore Thee by this most pure dust and sanctified tomb to forgive me and remit my grievous sins, and to ordain for me through Thy grace that which will bring solace to mine eyes and gladden my breast. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over all things, and within Thy grasp are the keys of mercy and prosperity. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.\n\nWe have now turned toward the Land of Alif and Ra, wherein We make mention of My loved ones who were not deterred by the hints of the divines nor held back by the veils of the mystics. They heard and responded - they are indeed of the assured ones. These are they who shattered the idols of vain fancy in the name of their Lord, the Lord of all beings, and held fast to the cord of God, the Lord of all worlds. And We make mention of the Most Great Victory who attained to that which was recorded in the Books of God and left his home, turning to the All-Informed One, until he entered Zawra and stood before the gate that was opened unto all on earth and in heaven, and heard the call of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nO My loved ones in that land! Beware lest the affairs of the world frighten you. Hold fast unto deeds and character, and unto that which will elevate the station of man. Thus have We commanded you before and in this exalted station. Preserve your stations and what hath been ordained for you from the presence of One mighty and powerful. The Glory shining and radiant from the horizon of grace be upon you and upon My handmaidens who heard the call and turned to the Supreme Horizon in days wherein the feet of the mature ones slipped.\n\nAnd We make mention of another land which God hath made the seat of His loved ones and the dawning-place of him who was named Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin. Hearken unto the call from the right side of the luminous spot, from the Crimson Tree: The dominion of earth and heaven belongeth unto God, the Goal of the sincere ones. We make mention of you as We mentioned you before, that ye may give thanks unto your Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing. Hold fast unto that which is goodly and that which beseemeth you and the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest transient affairs prevent you from the Kingdom of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are commanded by the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\n\nTribulations and adversities have touched you in My path, and I am the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. Ye have witnessed for the sake of God what no eyes have seen - to this testify all things and this perspicuous Book. Ye have heard the taunts of the enemies in the days of God, the Lord of Names. Hear now what floweth from My Most Exalted Pen in praise of your turning unto Him, your submissiveness, your humility, and your orientation toward the countenance of your Lord, the Mighty, the Luminous. By the life of God! What ye see today cannot equal My mention of you. Be thankful and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Goal of all seekers, and glory be unto Thee, O Glory of those in the heavens and the earth!\"\n\n11\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face toward the land wherein hath been diffused the fragrance of sincerity and submissiveness from those whom God hath related unto Himself and for whom He hath inscribed, from the Most Exalted Pen, that which none hath known save His all-encompassing knowledge. We have raised them to a station wherein the tongues of all created things speak their praise and glorification, and that which hath been sent down unto them from the Ancient Revealer. We bestow Our blessings upon their faces and pray for them, and We counsel them to observe the Most Great Steadfastness and to preserve that which hath been ordained for them by God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and I am the All-Wise Counsellor. And We make mention of My loved ones there who have aimed for the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Summit, and who have arisen to serve the Cause of their Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. Be ye as mountains in the Cause of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. This behooveth you, if ye be of them that comprehend. The world shall pass away and the winds of extinction shall seize it, but that which My Pen hath recorded and My truthful and trustworthy Tongue hath uttered shall endure. Take ye the chalice of immortality in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious, then drink therefrom in spite of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of creation.\n\n12\n\nWe make mention of the Land of Alif and Ra as a token of Our grace, for verily We are the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We counsel them with that which befitteth the days of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. O My Name! When thou meetest Ra and Jim, convey unto him My Glory and say: Be steadfast, for there hath come to thee a mighty matter whereby the limbs of the earth have quaked, the Trumpet hath been troubled, the Balance hath been stunned, and the Path hath lamented before the Face, by reason of that which hath befallen the Manifestation of the Cause through the doings of the heedless ones. Say: Be patient in God, then preserve what We have given thee. Soon there shall be made manifest unto thee that which hath been ordained by the One Who is Mighty and Ancient. Preserve thy station through this Most Great Name. Thus doth command thee He Who hath called all unto God, the Single, the All-Informed. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and say: O people! By God, the horizon of Revelation hath been illumined and that which was promised in the Scriptures of God, the True, the Mighty, the Wise, hath appeared. Cast aside what ye possess and take hold of that which the Lord of Eternity commandeth you, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. Say: The Most Great Book hath appeared. Verily it calleth aloud between earth and heaven and summoneth you unto a station before which all regions of the earth have bowed down, were ye of them that know. Deprive not yourselves of the Most Great Ocean and of that which hath been ordained for you in a glorious Tablet. Be thou in such wise as beseemeth the Cause of thy Lord. He, verily, shall aid thee and decree for thee what thou desirest of His bounty, which overshadoweth all things great and small. Arise with supreme steadfastness amidst mankind. This is what We commanded thee aforetime. Be thankful and be of them that praise. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and cling to His resplendent hem. Should thy son oppose thee in what We have commanded thee, leave him to thy Lord. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a Book which none hath comprehended save Him Who proclaimeth in every matter that there is no God but I, the Witness, the All-Hearing. Read thou this Tablet and ponder that which hath been sent down therein from the presence of One Who is Mighty and Powerful. Say: O people! Dispute not concerning the signs of God and deny not Him Who hath come unto you with what the learned possess. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Leave those who have no knowledge of this Cause to speak according to their desires. Lo! They are among the abased ones. O My loved ones there! Rejoice in that wherewith the Supreme Pen maketh mention of you in the prison of Akka and giveth you glad tidings of God's grace and mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Arise to serve the Cause in such wise that the veils of those who have clung to the Dayspring of idle fancies and have spoken that whereby the Holy Spirit hath lamented may not hinder you. From this spot We send Our glorification upon you and upon My handmaidens who have attained unto this wondrous Cause. We make mention of My loved ones in Manshad. By God! The Concourse on High hath grieved at your grief, and they who circle round the Throne have lamented at what hath befallen you at the hands of the oppressors. The Wronged One hath been with you, hearing and seeing, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Behold then remember what hath befallen the Lord of Names in the prison of Ta and in other lands from those who denied the right of God and His loved ones and who followed vain imaginings and idle fancies. Rejoice in that the Lord of the worlds remembereth you with such remembrance as hath caused every great mention to bow down before it. We counsel you to patience and forbearance and to that whereby the sanctity of the Cause may be manifested in cities and countries. Take hold of that which ye have been commanded by One Who is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. The light that shineth resplendent from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon you and upon those who have aided you and turned unto you out of love for God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\n13\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones in the Land of Dal and Ha, even as We mentioned them before, as a token of Our grace, that they may give thanks unto their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as the breezes of My loving-kindness have wafted over you, and My Pen hath testified to your acceptance, while its Lord lay imprisoned in a mighty prison. Beware lest the world's tribulations debar you from the Ancient Beauty. Cast away that which perisheth, and take hold of that which endureth, in the name of your Lord, the Everlasting, the Ever-Abiding, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Blessed is the arm that hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings and hastened to the shelter of the pavilions of the grandeur of his Lord, the Gracious One. We make mention of every servant who hath turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon, and of every maidservant who hath turned unto My Straight Path.\n\nWe make mention of 'Ali-Akbar, who fulfilled My Covenant and My Testament, who turned unto My countenance, soared in My atmosphere, stood before My gate, hearkened unto My call, attained My presence and reunion, and spoke forth My beauteous praise. Rejoice in the Supreme Companion, inasmuch as the Lord of Names, Who spoke from the Burning Bush unto Moses, son of 'Imran, making mention of thee, declaring: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Manifest, the Speaking One, the All-Powerful, the Mighty.\" O 'Ali-Akbar! We make mention of thee when thou didst leave thy homeland, turning towards the Most Sublime Horizon, enkindled with the fire of love for thy Lord, the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Eternity, and when thou wert among the people and there befell thee in the path of God that which caused the eyes of every just and knowing one to weep. We make mention of when thou didst circle round My throne and act in accordance with what was commanded thee in My perspicuous Book. We make mention of thy son and those who upheld what was right concerning him and arose to set his affairs in order out of love for God, the Lord of this utterance, the Revealer of these verses, the Manifestor of clear proofs, and the Speaker among the nations when seated upon the Most Great Throne. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nWe desire to make mention of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Blessed City of Light wherein was diffused the fragrance of the Beloved, His verses were spread abroad, His proofs were made manifest, His banners were raised, His tabernacle was pitched, and every wise command was detailed. That is the city wherein wafted the sweet savors of reunion, by which the sincere were drawn to the seat of nearness, sanctity and beauty. Blessed is he who purposed, attained, and drank the choice wine of meeting from the ocean of the bounty of his Lord, the Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy.\n\nO Land of Heart's Desire! I have come to thee from God and give thee glad tidings of His grace and mercy, and glorify thee from His presence. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto thee and discovered from thee the fragrance of God, the Lord of the worlds. Light be upon thee and glory be upon thee, inasmuch as God hath made thee a paradise for His servants and the blessed, hallowed earth whose mention He hath sent down in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers.\n\nO Land of Light! Through thee was raised the standard of \"There is none other God but Him,\" and within thee was planted the banner of \"Verily, I am the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.\" It behooveth every one who turneth unto thee to glory in thee and in whatsoever is therein of My branches, My leaves, My traces, My chosen ones, and My loved ones who have turned with supreme steadfastness unto My glorious station. We have not mentioned those whom We made the keys of victory, lest they be discovered by every oppressive one who is veiled. We, from this station, glorify thee, O My earth, and them, and those who have laid hold on this mighty, extended cord.\n\n14\n\nSay: O concourse of earth! Set aside your desires, clinging fast to My desire. By God, this is better for you than all that you behold this day. To this testifies the Book of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Do that which God has willed, not what your own selves have willed. Fear God and be not of those who comprehend not. Verily, he who clings to what he possesses cannot turn his face toward the face of God, the Everlasting, after the passing away of all things. Thus has My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this blessed and beloved Tablet.\n\nO Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of God's loved ones in Kha, that they may be drawn to a station wherein naught is seen save the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Through you the Word is ended in this station, and this is of My grace and favor unto you. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful over what has been. There is no God but Him, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Mighty, the Witnessed. Through you has dawned the horizon of certitude and clashed the swords of inner meanings in the arena of utterance, and through you has spoken the tongue of revelation: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Possessor of the seen and unseen.\" You have attained unto the days of God and His Cause, and have turned unto Him when the princes of earth, all of them, and every learned one made vain by knowledge, turned away. Blessed be your faces for having turned, and your tongues for having answered, and your hands for having been raised unto God, the Lord of the Kingdom. Thus has risen from the horizon of proof the Sun of utterance. Blessed is he who has recognized and attained, and woe unto every heedless one rejected. The light shining from the heaven of My favor be upon you, O captives of God in His earth and dawning-places of His firm, wise, and impregnable decree.\n\nO Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of what has come upon thee at this moment from God's firm and irrevocable decree. We were making mention of Our loved ones in the cities and lands when suddenly the door opened and one entered saying, \"Thy handmaiden has taken flight.\" We said: \"Unto God, the Mighty, the Loving.\" She was a handmaiden who set out for the Most Great House of God and left her station until she arrived and circumambulated and took for herself a station beneath the domes of grandeur. To this testifies the Lord of creation Who speaks what He spoke in the earliest days and before them. Verily, there is no God but I, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O My handmaiden! Upon thee be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness, and upon those who remember thee after thy ascension and who speak thy praise out of love for God, the King of Kings. I bear witness that thou didst turn to God and believe in Him and didst find the fragrances of the Manifestation when He appeared in truth with manifest sovereignty, and thou didst drink the choice wine of utterance from the hands of His bounty and didst witness what His Most Exalted Pen witnessed in His blessed station. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon My trusted servant who was known among the Concourse on High for his service to Me and to My chosen ones who arose to aid My Cause and who spoke in times of hardship and tribulation: \"We are God's, and to Him shall we return.\"\n\n=== END BH00050 ===\n\n=== START BH00051 ===\n\nSpiritual beloved, his honor Varqa - upon him be Baha'u'llah's Most Glorious Beauty - may observe.\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nThis servant beareth witness to that which God hath witnessed, and acknowledgeth that which the Supreme Pen hath acknowledged before the creation of all things - that there is none other God but Him. He hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in His knowledge, inscribed in His Book, symbolized in His Tablet, and treasured in the repository of His protection, in such wise that neither human limitations nor the whisperings of those who have denied the Lord of Destiny could prevent it. He hath arisen with such an arising that the pillars of princes and the foundations of the learned were shaken, and He hath proclaimed with the most exalted call between earth and heaven that there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, by Whose finger's beckoning the ocean of knowledge surged in the realm of possibility and the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted over all lands. Blessed is he who hath heard and hastened, and woe unto every hesitant doubter. Joy unto him who hath heard and responded, and woe unto every idolatrous disbeliever. I offer prayers, peace and glory upon His loved ones and chosen ones, whom neither the swords of enemies deterred from the Lord of all beings, nor the hosts of tyranny frightened in the days of their Lord, the Sovereign of all names. These are servants whose mention hath been voiced by every Book, whose glory and loftiness every scroll hath proclaimed, and whose excellence and sublimity every tablet hath extolled.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the world is illumined and through Whose mention the fragrance of utterance is diffused among the nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Breaker of the might of aggressors, the Refuge of the monotheists, and the Haven of the fearful, to protect Thy loved ones from the wicked among Thy servants and to aid them with such aid that in every city the banners of Thy Name and the standards of Thy mention may be raised. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest what hath befallen those whom heedlessness hath not overtaken in Thy path, and whose eyes have not witnessed sleep resting upon beds in Thy love. They traversed lands to exalt Thy Word and visited the servants to convey Thy Cause until they were expelled, seized and imprisoned for Thy Name's sake - the Name through which the river of life flowed and the breezes of revelation wafted over all who dwell in the realm of possibility. O Lord! Thou art He to Whose grandeur all things possible have testified, and to Whose power the tongues of all beings have witnessed. Adorn Thy loved ones, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, with that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in all conditions and grant them the chalice of Thy good-pleasure at all times. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all possibility and the Ordainer of all worlds.\n\nO beloved of my heart! By God's life, thy mention and praise, and that which flowed from thy pen and was uttered by thy lips, time and again, have gladdened me. Many a day did this servant arise while encompassed by sorrows at what had befallen thy honor and the loved ones of the All-Merciful, and there reached him what thou hadst sent, from which every person of discernment perceived the fragrance of thy sincerity and steadfastness, and the fragrance of thy support and faithfulness in days wherein the servants cast fidelity behind their backs and violated God's Covenant by following their own desires. When I read and understood, the wine of love for thee so intoxicated me that sorrows took flight. Thereupon I repaired to the Most Exalted Station and the heaven of the highest heavens until I attained the presence and presented myself before the Face. When the Ancient Beauty turned His attention to this servant, He spoke, exalted be His grandeur and mighty be His utterance:\n\nWe are the All-Knowing Witness.\n\nThis is the Day wherein the Kingdom of Utterance calleth aloud in the midmost heart of contingency: \"Blessed is he who hath aided the Cause of God and stood up to serve His Cause and quaffed the cup of tribulation in His path and the chalice of hardship in His love and was imprisoned for having summoned the people unto Him!\" And from the waves of the ocean of inner meanings is heard: \"Joy be to him from whom the fragrance of fidelity hath wafted throughout the realm of creation and who hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in a Cause whereby the feet of the denizens of the Kingdom of Names have slipped, save whom God hath willed, the Lord of all worlds.\"\n\nO Warqa! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The servant who is present hath come with thy letter and what thou didst send to him before and after. From every letter, every word, and every character have We inhaled the fragrance of thy love and thy steadfastness and thy sincerity and thy faithfulness and thy covenant in the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We bear witness that thou hast girded up thy loins to serve God and hast spoken His praise and proclaimed His Cause and rent asunder, through His Name, the veils of those who were held back from the Lord of destiny by the Most Great Veil which is called the world. We beseech God to aid thee and assist thee and preserve thee. Verily, He is potent over all things.\n\nWe make mention of thee every day and night, and We recall what hath befallen thee in this Cause, at Whose appearance all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\" Blessed is he who hath turned unto thee and loved thee and heard thy mention in this wondrous Cause. Say: O people of the Bayan and O people of creation! Beware lest ye deny Him Whom ye have worshipped throughout ages and centuries, through nights and days. Be fair in the name of God, then behold this Most Great Structure and hearken unto that wherewith this Great Announcement doth remind you. Say: He is the One foretold in the Torah and announced by the Spirit and Whose mention was sent down in the Qur'an from the presence of an ancient Lord. Fear God and deny not the signs of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and oppose Him not. He calleth you unto the supreme horizon, whereunto every discerning knower beareth witness.\n\nWe make mention on this night of My loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy and My bounty, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nWe make mention of the 'Ayn and the Ba, to whom God testifieth of his acceptance, his devotion, his remembrance, his praise, and his spending in this straight Path. Remember him and give him glad tidings. By My life! He hath attained unto a remembrance that no remembrance can equal and unto a word whose fragrance shall not be cut off throughout the endurance of the names of thy Lord, the Hearing, the Responding. We have heard what thou hast mentioned concerning him, and what the Trustworthy mentioned before, and what he hath done in the path of God, the Exalted, the Great. Convey My greetings unto him and unto the faces of My loved ones, and give them glad tidings of My favors, and remind them of what We have revealed unto thee in this Clear Tablet, that perchance the attraction of the utterance of the All-Merciful may so seize them that the might of the mighty shall not weaken them, nor shall the hosts of the oppressors frighten them. God shall soon seize them as He seized the peoples before them. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon every steadfast and upright one.\n\nThese pearls of the ocean of utterance need a hem vaster than earth and heaven to gather them together. God is Most Great! Who is able to enumerate them and who can swim in the depths of this Most Great Sea? What pearls! What are these words that this servant hath spoken and continues to speak? In truth, he should seek forgiveness throughout the endurance of the kingdom and the heavenly realm for what he hath said and continues to say. Yet praise be to the Object of the world and the Sovereign of nations, that the effulgences of the sun of His favor toward that spiritual beloved are clear, manifest and evident. We hope that they will, through the name of the Lord of existence, set hearts and souls ablaze with wisdom and utterance - an enkindling such that all who are on earth shall find themselves powerless to extinguish it. What has happened and what intoxication has seized the world? Yes, the intoxication of self and desire has prevented ears from hearing and eyes from seeing. Nevertheless, this servant holds fast to the cord of generosity and clings to the hem of favor, and beseeches Him not to deprive His servants of the waves of the ocean of meanings. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nSome time ago, letters arrived from the honored master, His Eminence the Trustee Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God. In two letters he mentioned in detail your honor and the spiritual beloved 'A.B., upon him be the Glory of God, and he was very pleased and satisfied. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may aid them in that which is befitting and grant them that which is worthy of His generosity and mercy.\n\nConcerning what was written about the means for promoting the Cause and spreading the divine verses and laws, this matter was presented before the Presence. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, blessed and exalted be His words: \"Today it is incumbent upon every soul to serve the Cause of God. God, exalted be His glory, has made earthly affairs dependent upon means. Every soul must pay the Rights of God, and one-third of the Rights of the Land of ?a and its surroundings must be spent on the interests of teaching and spreading the Cause and establishing it. All must be engaged in supporting the Cause in perfect unity and must strive to their utmost ability to exalt the Word. God has forbidden contention and conflict - this is the most great bounty and the supreme favor.\"\n\nIn all ages, assured and steadfast souls have, in accordance with the command, supported the Cause with life and property. Now it is dependent on property alone. This servant beseeches and hopes from God that He may enable all to accomplish that which benefits the Cause. Verily, He is the Helper, the Generous.\n\nThe items that were sent arrived. However, when the two photographs attained the blessed presence, He observed them and then, smiling, uttered these supreme words: \"O servant! They are present in this moment in the presence, and the reward of attainment has been inscribed by the Pen of Will. Blessed be they both, and may it be wholesome for them both.\" The gaz also arrived and attained the presence, and was bestowed upon every soul who was present before Him, both at that time and afterwards. We praise God for this.\n\nOn one occasion, this servant attained the presence with a petition from the spiritual friend, his honor A.B., upon him be the Glory of God and His favors. After permission was granted, it was presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply - His glory be glorified:\n\nHe is the Near, the Answering One \\[...\\]\n\nThe Wronged One hath heard thy call and hath answered thee with that which hath diffused the fragrance of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. This is a Day wherein the Mother Book crieth out and saith: \"Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which was hidden in divine knowledge and recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds.\" And the Mother of the Bayan calleth aloud, saying: \"O peoples of the earth! By God! The veils have been rent asunder, and the Intended One is come, speaking openly before all the world: 'The Promise is fulfilled and this is the Promised One Who proclaimeth: Verily there is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the All-Informed.'\" And the Mother of the Tablets crieth out saying: \"The gate of reunion hath been opened unto all who are in earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and attained. He is indeed of those who are brought near in a perspicuous Book.\" And the Crimson Scroll proclaimeth amidst the concourse of creation, saying: \"Blessed is he who hath attained unto the days of God and hath acted according to that which hath been recorded in His precious Book.\"\n\nO thou who hast turned thy face toward Mine own! Rejoice in My remembrance of thee. We have accepted what thou hast done in His path, and have sent down for thee, both aforetime and at this hour, that which nothing can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. We bear witness that thou hast heard the call of the All-Merciful, hast turned unto Him and held fast unto His Strong Cord. How many a servant hath heard and hastened, then turned away from God, and how many a servant hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in such wise that through his constancy the limbs of the idolaters were made to quake. Read thou what We have revealed unto thee, by the hosts of My Kingdom's denizens. Thus doth He command thee Who possesseth a perspicuous Book. We counsel thee to observe wisdom, lest the clamor of every remote transgressor be raised. Give thanks unto God that thy deeds have been accepted, thy call hath been heard, and thy letter hath attained unto My Most Great Prison. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among thy kindred, and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken concerning them that which shall never perish and whose fruits shall appear day after day. This year all have been commanded to practice concealment lest clamor be raised among the people. This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to them and declareth: \"Happy is he, for he hath attained unto the special favors of God, exalted be His glory.\" That which hath been revealed beareth witness to what hath been stated, and a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath also been sent separately. God willing, they shall attain unto it and receive their portion from the oceans of His grace. Glory be to God! This servant is astonished at these heedless people - to what have they attached their hearts and with what are they occupied? Do they deny the transience of the world, or are they unaware of its changes and transformations? They have taken conjecture in place of certitude, and fancy in place of assurance. Soon shall all return to nothingness, and there shall remain for those brought near only what God hath revealed in the Book. As commanded, they must observe wisdom and act in accordance therewith, for this matter hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in numerous Tablets and its observance is obligatory upon all. He verily protecteth whom He willeth and aideth whom He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. It is entirely clear and evident that the True Protector is God, exalted be His glory, yet it is necessary and incumbent to act in accordance with what He hath commanded, for people are not all observed to be at the same station. Therefore must the loved ones be considerate and remind them.\n\nHe is God! Exalted be His station of glory, grandeur and utterance!\n\nRegarding what was written about several souls from the land of S and Y who are heading to this land for agriculture according to the counsel of the honored beloved, the distinguished Amin, upon him be the glory of God - this matter was presented by Amin and they said: \"The prison situation is uncertain, as disturbances have been mentioned both before and after. Therefore it is more prudent for them to remain in that same land.\" Today the primary and universal divine cultivation has been and continues to be the sowing of the blessed Word. We beseech God to assist them and others in service to the Cause.\n\nAs for the mention of my beloved Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, my beloved Ibn-i-A?daq, and my beloved Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon them be the glory of God - in these days their letters arrived addressed to this evanescent servant. Praise be to God, every word thereof spoke in praise of Truth and bore witness to their acceptance, attention, humility and submissiveness before God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. A letter also arrived from His Holiness Ismu'llah Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious Glory, mentioning that beloved of the heart. Their intention was that that beloved one should travel to those regions. After presenting this in the Most Holy Court, they said: \"It is very good, however the requirements of wisdom must be observed, for after the episode in the land of ?a, some movement has appeared in every land.\" And they said: \"We beseech God to assist Ismu'l-Jamal in wisdom.\"\n\nRegarding what was written about the beloved of the heart A and ?, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and the relatives and friends of that land, upon them be the glory of God - these matters were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for them from God, the Lord of the worlds. His word - exalted be His majesty and mighty be His utterance \\[...\\]\n\nO people of Mim! Your Ancient Lord makes mention of you with that which draws you nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. During the nights hath the Supreme Pen remembered you, and during the days it moveth upon your names. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous. At all times there hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful the river of wisdom and utterance. Blessed are they that drink thereof. O My loved ones there! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One when sorrows encompassed Him through those who disbelieved in the Day of Judgment. By God's life! Were ye to hearken with true hearing--that is, were ye to hear the Call of Truth with the ear of inner truth--ye would be set ablaze in such wise that the peoples of the world would be powerless to quench it. Today the Sun calleth out, and the waves of the ocean summon mankind unto the most exalted horizon. The rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is raised from one direction, and from another floweth the Kawthar of the All-Merciful's utterance. They that have not drunk from the ocean of knowledge and are deprived of hearkening to the divine call must arise with perfect steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of all beings, in such wise that neither the aggressive, nor the irreligious, nor the deceitful may debar you from the Most Exalted Horizon. Today the heavens of Revelation are adorned with the stars of utterance, and the horizon of the world is illumined with the splendors of the light of His countenance. Strive ye, that ye may attain unto that which beseemeth the days of God. Moses gave all men the glad-tidings of this Day, and Christ promised it. The Seal of the Prophets--may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him--was commanded in the mighty stronghold of the Qur'an to give the glad-tidings of the Day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Know ye the value of this time! By God's life, it is more precious and more beloved than the crimson philosophers' stone, for while the latter, as is said, transmuteth one color into another, or one body into another, this time and this moment, which in the Qur'an is termed \"the Hour\" and mentioned as \"the Resurrection,\" bestoweth life upon the world and conferreth the spirit of the animal. O party of God! Arise as behoveth you and act as is worthy. Be not grieved by the might of princes, the power of the strong, or the glory of the divines. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance which speaketh at this moment--ere long shall all return with utter abasement and regret to the station appointed for them as a consequence of their deeds. Praise be to God! Ye have attained unto that from which all others are veiled. Ye have drunk that whereof all are seen to be deprived, save whom God willeth. With the arm of certitude, take hold of the Perspicuous Book. This is that which shall profit you in all the worlds of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have, out of wisdom from Us and protection from Our presence, veiled the mention of him who loved Me and attained unto My Tablets, and verily We are the Concealer, the All-Wise.\n\nO people of S and Y! The Wronged One makes mention of you from the prison and gives you glad tidings of the favors of God, the Lord of all worlds. There has come before the Wronged One a letter from him who has arisen to serve My Cause, who circled round Me and soared in My atmosphere, wherein was your mention. We have made mention of you with this wondrous mention. Beware lest anything keep you back from God, the Lord of all names. Give thanks unto God for having created you, sustained you, and aided you to hearken to His most sweet call when it was raised between earth and heaven. Verily your Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Be not grieved by the doubts of the people of the Bayan and the intimations of the divines of the earth who have broken the Covenant of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nBlessed are they who in this day arise wholly to offer praise and glorification, but this must be done with wisdom, for the heedless people cling to the manifestations of fancy and vain imaginings. They are seen to be unaware of the sealed wine and bereft of the Kawthar of utterance. The loved ones in that land must, with perfect unity and harmony, occupy themselves with the mention and praise of the True One and aid the Creator with the hosts of goodly character. By the life of God! Were you to become aware of what hath been ordained by the Supreme Pen, you would all exclaim: \"Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!\" Be not saddened by what hath come to pass or what may yet come to pass. The command is in His hand. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Powerful. The glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon them that have believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nIndeed, one matter has become the cause of great regret, namely that in every place where a believer was arrested, first the Tablets and Writings were seized, and then the owner of the house. Glory be to God! Are the Tablets and Writings to be kept in front of the houses of the friends or in places exposed to all eyes? In the land of Ta, many Tablets and Writings fell into the hands of the oppressors. A hundred thousand regrets, for they do not preserve them and may perhaps destroy them all. The people of God must exert their utmost effort in protecting the divine verses, that they may be safeguarded from treacherous eyes and thieving hands. This servant has expressed this to some of the friends. God willing, they will be assisted. Among other things, all the writings of the beloved Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, fell into the hands of the enemies. In any case, they took most of these along with other writings to the government. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve whatever has fallen into the hands of the oppressors. Verily He is the Preserver, the Wise.\n\nThey had written mentioning Haji Muhammad-Tahir, upon him be the Glory of God. This matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for him once again from God, the Lord of all beings. His word, mighty is His utterance and manifest His proof:\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the Generous \\[...\\]\n\nO Muhammad-Taher! The Wronged One makes mention of thee at a time when sorrows have surrounded Him from the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings of those who claim knowledge without clear proof or evidence. These are they who would mount the pulpits to make mention of God, the Lord of creation. When they concluded their remembrances with mention of the Proof, they arose and said \"May God hasten his advent.\" Yet when the veils were rent asunder and the clouds parted, they arose in opposition until they pronounced their verdict against Him with such injustice as caused the trees in the mountains to lament. They passed judgment on Him Whom they had remembered throughout the nights and days. By God! Because of their tyranny the eyes of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven wept. He in Whose possession is the Mother Book bears witness to this. Blessed art thou for having cast them behind thee and for having turned to God with spirit and fragrance. We have heard thy call and what thou hast composed in remembrance of this Wronged One Who was banished and exiled throughout the lands. By the life of God! We call unto all who are on earth even as We called them before, and We make mention of what We mentioned before all faces. The might of the mighty cannot hinder Us, nor the clamor of the divines, nor the roaring of men. The hosts of the world cannot weaken Us. The Lord of Eternity, Who proclaims \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful,\" bears witness to this. We beseech God to assist thee in preserving what He hath ordained for thee. He is verily the Helper, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken My remembrance, the face that hath turned toward My face, the ear that hath been honored to hear My call, and the hand that hath clung to the cord of God, the Lord of Lords. The glory shining from the horizon of the Tablet be upon thee and upon those who have cast aside what the people possess, turning unto God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nThus ends what was revealed. Praise and gratitude be to God. They have attained to that which hath no peer or likeness. The bounty of God, exalted be His glory, is evident from the fragrances of His verses. God willing, they shall be enabled to engage in remembrance, praise, and the greatest steadfastness in all conditions. This servant offers his utter nothingness and effacement in service to them, and conveys remembrance and glorification.\n\nAs to what you wrote regarding the veil, although certain ordinances have been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, the matter of covering has been ordained and is concealed from all. However, considering wisdom, what has been observed is that in most matters the previous ruling remains in effect until the greatest separation occurs, lest it become a cause of remoteness and avoidance by the people, that perchance they may be enabled to hearken unto the Word and act according to what God has willed.\n\nAs to what was written concerning the elixir, this Most Exalted Word was repeatedly heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: \"O servant in attendance! Whatever hath been revealed concerning the elixir from the heaven of divine Will was in response to the questions of the servants. They repeatedly asked until that which was revealed was revealed. Otherwise, the Most Exalted Pen would not have addressed it and hath not had, nor hath, any inclination to mention such matters. The Prophets have made mention of it, and likewise the philosophers have had countless discussions about the existence or non-existence of this art. Some have said that bodies other than gold are prevented from attaining to this station due to ailments, and that the power and balance of the elixir removes this and reveals their original color and essence. Others have deemed this impossible, saying that these metals are each composed of different elements and that the elixir is incapable of acting upon different contradictory things. Many philosophers have considered the transformation of essence impossible. The books of the people are filled with such mentions, objections, and differences among philosophers and others. However, if one possessed of insight and vision were to reflect upon the utterances that have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, the matter of its existence or non-existence would become evident and manifest unto him.\" Time and again this servant has presented the petitions of the friends of God who have inquired about this matter, and some have shown utmost insistence in their questioning. Therefore there flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which exists. Once this Most Exalted Word was heard, He said: \"O servant in attendance! If no answer were to be revealed, there would be fear that they might attribute it to a lack of divine knowledge.\" And to each person an answer was revealed containing within it a prohibition, save for one or two. The prohibition against engaging in this work has been repeatedly revealed. The wisdom of the past has entirely differed from the wisdom of the present. In the elements, in the planets, and likewise in movements, spirits and bodies, fundamental differences have appeared, both in effects and in numbers, and assuredly in future years that which is now hidden from eyes shall be revealed. This Most Great Revelation is the cause and reason for the opening of the gates of sciences and wisdom. No one hath yet fully enumerated the sciences and hosts of Truth. How many manifest suns have not been seen, and how many moons remain hidden from sight! If all the world were to gather and attempt to enumerate the creation of but one of the fixed stars and the planets revolving around it, they would surely find themselves powerless and would utter the blessed words \"None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him.\"\n\nThe glad tidings are that yesterday the Ancient Beauty proceeded from the Mansion of Bahji to the Mansion of Mazra'ih with a group, and when they reached the resting place of His father - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - He paused, and there was revealed for him that whose fragrance endureth, whose mention endureth, and whose word and meaning endureth. Blessed be he and joyous be he who, in coming and going, hath attained to this most great bounty the like of which the eye of the world hath not seen. This station is beyond mention.\n\nConcerning what was written about the Revelation of John, upon Him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, it is correct. He has mentioned with utmost clarity, as He says that the New City shall descend from heaven, meaning the New Jerusalem shall descend in Jerusalem, as indeed it did descend. There are many signs, but time does not permit. What that beloved one wrote is correct, but the people do not understand.\n\nAs for what was mentioned about the Well-Ordered Pearl and the traditions recorded therein, it is fitting and conforming, but the people are antagonistic and hypocritical. In this land too, some have found clear signs, evident proofs, and decisive traditions in the books, all of which indicate the appearance of the Hidden Name, the Treasured Secret, and the Complete All-Embracing Word, and yet no one is aware. The Prussian group, despite acknowledging that \"we have turned to this land to attain the Manifestation, for it is written in our books that the Manifestation is near or has passed,\" yet they remain heedless. The world is overtaken by the stupor of negligence. One day these words were heard from the Mouth of the Will of the Lord of all beings: \"O servant in attendance! Today the sun bears witness, the sea cries out, the earth gives tidings. The intoxication of vain desire has so seized the people that they are oblivious to themselves and others, let alone this station and the recognition of the station that has been the ultimate hope of those near to God, the monotheists, and the sincere ones.\"\n\nAs to what was written concerning the revered Shaykh and the revered Siyyid - upon them be all the most glorious Glory of God - that among some of the friends there are discussions about their stations and ranks, claiming that the Ahmadi Revelation represents the celestial station of Muhammad and that the station of Prophethood was offered to them but they declined it - whether these statements have any foundation or are mere products of vain imaginings - they are assuredly nothing but vain imaginings. When this matter was mentioned in the presence of the Ancient Beauty, He paused for some time in His explanation and then said with great regret that the friends of God should not speak of that which is far from justice. The glory of Ahmad lies in that he became aware of certain mysteries of Prophethood and became the bearer of the Trust. This station is most exalted and sufficient for him, by the Lord of all worlds. All manifestations, revelations, sainthood, pillars, poles, chiefs, nobles and whatever stations are mentioned as praiseworthy among the servants have appeared through his word and attained their lofty stations.\n\nSome mystics have said things that were not befitting. Some have fabricated inner meanings and counted themselves among its people. By the life of God, they are lower than a gnat in the sight of Truth! An unjust mystic has said that the station of Prophethood is the station of announcement, while the station of mystical unveiling and witnessing is above it - considering the second to be the station of saints and the first to be the station of Prophets. This sightless one devoid of truth has failed to understand even this much: that the announcements of the Prophets came after mystical unveiling and witnessing. Indeed, they were the very essence of witnessing and unveiling and its reality. Through them appeared every wise command and every great mystery. The Prophets have been the source of both Prophethood and sainthood, and through the word of the Prophets have saints appeared in the earth.\n\nIn brief, most people have spoken and continue to speak according to their desires. Many times have these exalted words been heard from the Source of verses. He has said that every day an apostate appears and takes away a river from the ocean of Muhammad's Law, until at last the ocean was seen to be diminished, as is witnessed today. The Cause is one and the Path is one, and unity and concord are praised in the divine Books, Psalms and Scriptures. Nevertheless, these differences that are witnessed have all been from transgressors and apostates. Should anyone wish to enumerate the branches of the spiritual path that are mentioned and known among people today, he would need to spend much time.\n\nThe servant asks his Lord to adorn all with the collyrium of justice and the Kawthar of equity, and to grant them the cup of righteousness. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. According to His command, remind the people of these things, that perchance these vain imaginings may be effaced. Ignorant and heedless souls have afflicted the people. Convey with the utmost joy and fragrance and wisdom that which is befitting.\n\nThe station of the revered Shaykh and the elevated Siyyid - upon them be the glory of God and His favors - is most exalted. Once these blessed words issued forth from the Source of divine wisdom: \"O servant in attendance! Ahmad and Kazim were aware and informed of the meanings of the divine Books. With the intention of attracting hearts, they made certain statements, and their purpose was to bring people near, that they might attain the Word of Truth - as indeed those souls who first entered the divine Law were of that party.\" \\[...\\]\n\nThe purpose was the drawing nigh of souls, that perchance they might attain unto the Word of Truth, even as did those who first entered the Divine Law. That party it was, and this fact beareth witness to their awareness, knowledge, wisdom and the straight path to which they held fast. Well is it with them.\n\nTowards the end, the honored Siyyid--upon him be all the most glorious glory--repeatedly stated: \"Do you not wish for me to depart so that the Truth may be made manifest?\" This was the essential meaning of his words, but in accordance with the requirements of wisdom, there appeared from him what appeared.\n\nAs to what was asked about the Manifestations of the Cause, they possessed and possess stations in the mother source, and these were revealed according to the requirements of the times and circumstances.\n\nConcerning what was asked about the blessed verse revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, His words, blessed and exalted be He: \"Whoso layeth claim to a Cause before the completion of a full thousand years...\" etc. This matter was presented, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: \"O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and circleth round the Cause...\" That which all are bound to recognize hath been revealed in this blessed verse, and all are obliged to acknowledge it and hold fast to it. Most of the ignorant are heedless and walk in the paths of delusion, and most people are unaware. Therefore was this blessed verse revealed as a bounty, that they might not follow every barking dog and become the cause of dissipating the Cause of God.\n\nIn truth, this blessed verse is a great bounty for all, for that Beloved One knoweth that each day a barking ariseth from some direction, and likewise deeds that have caused and led to the dissipation of God's Cause. They imagine that the Cause of God is like children's play, each day engaging in some game and uttering some word. Lost indeed are they who have spoken that for which they had no leave from God, and have done that which hath caused the eye of justice and equity to weep. That beloved one must remind the people.\n\nRegarding what was asked about another blessed verse, His words, blessed and exalted be He: \"Say: This is the Hidden Knowledge which shall never change...\" The purpose of this utterance can be understood from the rest of the verse, His exalted words: \"for it is derived from the letter Ta, which indicateth the hidden Name, the Manifest, the Impregnable, the Inaccessible\" and the number of division corresponds and agrees with the complete number of the nine fractions. Today the world of the unseen and the visible circleth round the indicative Ta. By the life of Our purpose and your purpose and the purpose of all who are in the heavens and the earth, there is concealed within this sovereign of letters, namely Ta, that which all the pens of the world are powerless and incapable of describing.\n\nAs to what was written regarding his honor Aqa 'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. His words, blessed and exalted be He: \"O 'Ali! Thou hast attained unto the grace of God in that which hath been the purpose of creation. Preserve this station for the sake of the One Beloved. The irreligious and the transgressors have been and are lying in wait. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and fix thy gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon, speaking My beautiful praise. In affairs take counsel, and then act, placing thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, He is with thee and will aid thee, and He is the Mighty, the All-Loving.\"\n\nIn His Name, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.\n\nAs to the repeated mention of the beloved of the heart, his honor A.B., upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, he has never been and will never be absent from this evanescent one's sight. Praise be to God, they have attained to the favors of the True One. That which was written to this servant, and likewise the petition dispatched to the Most Holy Court, all were presented before His presence and attained the honor of His hearing. His word, exalted be His majesty and all-encompassing be His bounty: \"They have ever been and continue to be the recipients of the True One's favors. Their requests have been heard with the ear of acceptance. They have attained to that which was revealed in the Divine Books regarding the mention of these days. This is a grace that no other grace can equal. We beseech the True One to ordain for them that which is the cause of eternal success and triumph, and not to deprive them of that which is befitting. We have granted permission for attainment of His presence and have recorded the reward thereof. O 'Ayn and Ba, give thanks to the Intended One of all worlds, Who has assisted thee to turn towards Him, to recognize Him, to love Him, and to serve His Cause. To Him be praise and glory. He has adorned thee with such an adornment whose mention shall never be erased from the world, and has ordained for thee that which He has ordained for those near unto Him. We testify that thou hast attained unto My good-pleasure and hast drunk the choice wine of recognition from the hand of My bounty. Give thanks unto God for this manifest grace.\" Each and every matter they raised was presented and received His gracious response. In each instance the sun of favor and grace dawned and shone forth from the horizon of His will. All that was done regarding that beloved one has been mentioned at the Divine Threshold and has attained the ornament of acceptance. This servant beseeches the True One to assist them in all conditions. As commanded, they must be mindful of and hold fast unto wisdom. The robe and circle will also arrive, God willing.\n\nAs to the mention they made of the departed and elevated one, his honor Mirza A.B., upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, all that that beloved one mentioned was and is correct. There hath been revealed for him from the Supreme Pen that which nothing in all creation can equal. This matter too was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. His word, blessed and exalted be He \\[...\\]\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon and quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the cup of the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of Names. Say: The glory shining forth from the heaven of thy Lord's mercy, the Lord of creation, be upon thee, O thou who didst turn unto the Countenance when the limbs of the servants did quake. I testify that thou didst hear the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and didst answer thy Lord when earthquakes seized the tribes of the earth and hearts were troubled through fear of God, the Lord of Lords. Blessed be thine ear, for it hath heard, and thine eye, for it hath seen, and thy heart, for it hath turned, and thy face, for it hath set itself toward the Qiblih of all horizons. Thou art he whom neither the calumnies of the divines nor the might of the powerful could deter. Thou didst hold fast to the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of thy Lord's grace on a Day whereon the trumpet was sounded, and the Balance set up, and the Bridge laid down, and that which was hidden in the hearts of those who violated God's Covenant and Testament and turned away until they pronounced judgment against Him was made manifest. Blessed art thou, O servant of God, and blessed are they who turn unto thee and visit thy grave, by virtue of what the Most Exalted Pen hath spoken in this Prison which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names. Blessed is he who remembereth thy days and maketh mention of that which hath been sent down unto thee from God, thy Creator, thy Fashioner, thy Provider, thy Helper, thy Supporter, the One Who giveth thee life and causeth thee to die. Glory be upon thee, and light be upon thee, and peace be upon thee from God, thy Lord, thy Beloved, thy Desire, and the Desire of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nPreviously also there was revealed specially for him that which shall endure in the garden of divine books. Happy is he! And that which hath now been revealed beareth witness to this. Praise be to God, divine mercy encompassed him and His grace took him by the hand. Again, happy is he! This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to assist his son in all that is befitting. This servant conveyeth greetings and glorification unto him, and likewise unto Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the glory of God and His grace, and unto all the friends and loved ones, upon them be the glory of God. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to intoxicate all with the wine of the realm of inner meanings, in such wise that they may behold none save the Friend and seek none save the Friend.\n\nHis honor the imprisoned one of Rasht, upon him be the glory of God, who graced that land with his presence, hath ever been and continueth to be before Our eyes. Time and again mention of him hath been heard from the tongue of Grandeur in the Most Holy Presence. God willing, may he be assisted to do that which is befitting. They made mention of the coolness of the eyes and fruits of the heart, 'Azizu'llah and Ruhu'llah. Their mention was made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. He recited that which was and shall be the manifestation, exposition, evidence and sign of divine grace, bounty and mercy. Two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent specially for them. God willing, may they attain unto them.\n\nMention was made of the friends and notables of that land. Each one hath, through the grace of God - exalted be His glory - attained unto His mention, and been recorded by the Pen of His Command. The bounty of God hath reached such heights that tongue and pen fall short of describing it. For some, special Tablets have been revealed individually, while for others mention hath been made collectively in a single Tablet. This latter approach is more conducive to preservation. Copies should be made and given to their recipients. What hath been sent this time should not exceed this, and hereafter the matter resteth in God's hands. He doeth as He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth. Peace and glory and majesty be upon you, upon those with you, upon those who have attained unto that which none before them had attained, and upon every patient and grateful soul. Praise be to God, the Powerful, the Kind, the Forgiving.\n\nThe Servant\n\n11 Safar 1302\n\nAnother letter from that beloved one, dated 26 Dhi'l-Hajjih, arrived as the post was being sealed. Praise be to God, it brought joy to our eyes. Specifically for Aqa Mirza Muhammad - upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\] - a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was sent. God willing, he will attain unto it.\n\nConcerning what was written about the disagreements of certain ones, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. He - glorified be His majesty - said: \"Let them not be saddened by such matters and deplorable deeds. Soon all shall return and become aware of their loss. Your steadfastness suffices to awaken those souls. They shall soon acknowledge thy counsel and turn unto thee. The same souls who now praise such deeds shall confess their evil. Blessed art thou, and woe unto him who is heedless. Verily thy Lord is the Elucidator, the All-Knowing, and He is the Rememberer, the Counselor, the Speaker, the Compassionate, the Generous.\"\n\nThis servant's humble submission is that whatever was received from that beloved one expressing devotion, humility and submissiveness to the presence of the Two Most Great and Most Blessed Branches - may my spirit, my being and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - this servant presented it. They showed countless tokens of bounty, recalled the days of attainment to Their presence, and sent greetings, praise and glory. They said: \"God willing, may they remain firm in the assistance of God's Cause as they have been.\" Whenever mention is made, this evanescent one presents it, and tokens of Their perpetual bounty are manifested. Likewise the two other Most Pure and Most Luminous Branches - may my spirit be sacrificed for their footsteps - and the dwellers of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur, all send their greetings and make mention. All glory be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you.\n\n=== END BH00051 ===\n\n=== START BH00052 ===\n\nThis is the Surah of the Robe which We have sent down in truth and made it the manifestation of Mine own Temple amongst the worlds. In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Holy, and in His Name, the Luminous, the All-Glorious!\n\nO ye dwellers of immortality in the most exalted Paradise! Hearken unto the Call of God from this Breeze that moveth within this gentle air beneath this delicate and subtle heaven. Verily it announceth unto mankind the Most Great Pilgrimage through this Greatest Word which hath been inscribed upon the form of the line in this Book by the Pen of Glory with grace. Say: Verily this is the Most Great Book which was sealed with the seal of God, hidden behind the veils of the unseen, and treasured within the vaults of glory, and hath appeared through grace in the form of justice in the days which were promised in truth.\n\nO Thou Solace of the Spirit! Rain down upon all created things from the heaven of Thy grace that which will make them independent of all that exists between \\[the earths\\] and the heavens, for they were poor in the innermost mystery and at the threshold of these domes before the Dawning-Place of this Beauty, having been, by Thy leave, caused to pause.\n\nO Thou Solace of the Spirit! Verily the idolaters were in doubt concerning Thy Cause after We made Thee speak with the melody of remembrance at the Dayspring of Light in this Revelation which hath shone forth from this Mount that hath been raised upon these two names in these two resplendent Suns in the two Beauties. Grieve thou not, but be patient, then show forth supreme patience, for verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, guardeth thee from the hosts of Satan, and He hath ever been wise over all the worlds. Rend asunder the veils from thy countenance, then the holy veils from thy beauty, then arise from the dayspring of paradise in the temple of light in the form of spirit. Turn not unto anyone nor cast thy glance upon the faces of the idolaters, but turn thy face toward the direction of the Throne, toward thy Lord. Verily He sufficeth thee against all the worlds, and He will assist thee in truth and will aid thee at all times even as He aided thee through grace such that the Spirit spoke within thy breast and made thee a shining light unto all the worlds.\n\nSay: By God! I am the Most Great Manifestation in the most exalted Paradise, the Most Pure Beauty in the Most Glorious Horizon, the Most Evident Word at the Furthermost Tree, the Mighty Announcement at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, the Hidden Countenance in the heaven of destiny, and the Mystery of God and His Command in the kingdom of origination. Through a signal from My Pen hath appeared the decree of the Kaf between earth and heaven and the command of the Nun in the cities of names. Verily thy Lord, the Generous, hath preferred thee in truth and made thee a mighty pillar unto all the worlds.\n\nSay: I am the Most Great Pillar and the Most Perfect Word, and whosoever holdeth fast unto Me hath indeed held fast unto the cord of God, the Strong One, in this Perspicuous Announcement which was concealed behind the pavilion of infallibility beyond the veils of grandeur, hidden in truth.\n\nO Thou Solace of Eternity in the Dayspring of Light! By God, Thou art the Ruler in this heaven; therefore rule as Thou pleaseth, for through that which hath been established by Thee are the decrees of destiny confirmed through execution. Verily the suns and moons and stars are all made subservient by Thy command. To Thee belongeth the command in the heaven of eternity and to Thee belongeth creation in the kingdom of earth and heaven, for verily Thy Lord, there is no God but He, hath made Thee in truth a pure helper and supporter unto all the worlds.\n\nO people of earth! Do you imagine that you can enter Paradise in this Eden which hath appeared in the Temple of the All-Merciful in these gardens without love for this Youth, the Eternal, the One, the Ancient of Days, the Everlasting, the Persian, the Arabian, the Divine? Evil is that which ye have imagined within yourselves, for verily the abode of the wrong-doers hath been fixed, in justice, in the fire which blazeth in the depths of hell. Say: We have, in justice, cast terror into the hearts of the idolaters, and into the hearts of them that have recognized Divine unity have We sent down tranquility through the grace of this Book which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Unseen as a bounty unto all the worlds.\n\nO people of creation! Hearken unto the melodies of God in the midmost heart of the Paradise of Ridvan from the Sacred Lote-Tree which hath been planted by the hands of the All-Merciful in the land of saffron. Say: By God! Through but one note thereof did the Light shine forth upon the elevated Mount in the holy Sinai beyond the sea of rapture unto Moses, He Who conversed with God, in the canopy of eternity near the furthermost Tree, from this Fire which flameth yellow: \"Verily I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old,\" and verily He doth encompass all the worlds. And through another note thereof were the spirits stirred within the bodies of all created things, and the Bird of the Divine Throne warbled betwixt earth and heaven, and the Holy Spirit spoke with a wondrous tongue most eloquent. Through it were made manifest the mysteries of the letter K and N, and God's favor was perfected upon all who are in the heavens and on earth, and the Beauty of God appeared with such splendor as caused all in the kingdom to swoon away.\n\nO people of earth! If ye be not content with this most pure Beauty in this most great Ridvan, die then in your wrath! Verily He hath appeared with the truth, and God hath made Him a light unto them that have recognized Divine unity and a fire unto the idolaters, and verily He seeth all things. Say: On this day no one's call shall ascend unto God save his who hath entered the eternal Paradise which is the court of this Word that speaketh the truth upon this exalted Mount which hath been raised up by the Command. Say: Verily this is the Book of God, the sealed and treasured Tablet which hath been preserved in truth beneath the vaults of might behind the veils of infallibility. O concourse of earth and heaven! Are ye able to pass beyond the borders of this fortress which hath been raised up behind the mountain of glory from bars of iron? And can ye find any way to leave God's earth? Nay, by Him besides Whom there is none other God! Ye shall neither find means to pass beyond nor power to leave. Therefore hold ye fast unto this yellow cord in this atmosphere which shineth in this heaven that hath been manifested in this cloud which hath appeared with a crimson hue at the heart of this paradise which the eyes of the exalted ones have not perceived, that ye may be recorded by God's Pen as being among the people of Paradise in the holy Ridvan.\n\nO people of the Bayan! Do ye say as said they of old that God's hand is chained up, or do ye imagine within yourselves that the gates of grace have been sealed shut after they had forever been open before the faces of the heavens and earth? Say: By God! The gate of holiness hath then been opened on the right hand of Paradise and there hath appeared therefrom the Ancient Beauty with manifest sovereignty. This is He Whom God hath made a herald of glad tidings unto them that have recognized Divine unity and a warner unto the idolaters, and verily He is God's Lamp between the heavens and the earth, lit of itself for itself from its own oil, from which illumination do the denizens of the most exalted Paradise receive their light, then the dwellers by the crimson sea, then the inhabitants of the holy ocean behind the billows of grandeur. Thus hath the matter been inscribed in truth by the Pen of Destiny upon the Tablet of Accomplishment.\n\nO Pupil of Immortality! Withhold not the outpourings of Thy grace from all created things, nor remain veiled behind the curtains of allusion. Come forth from the chambers of ruby, then pour forth the wine of everlasting life in this paradise from the chalices of the All-Merciful, by the hand of this Youth who hath been witnessed from the horizon of holiness adorned with the ornament of God. Beware lest Thou close Thine eyes to grace and withhold the Kawthar of bounty from Thy servants. Look not upon them nor upon what they possess, but gaze with the Most Great Vision upon a station gloriously praised. Have mercy upon them, then raise up in this heaven the clouds of glory and eternity, then shower upon all created things the beloved rain of grace. For verily Thou art the Munificent One in the kingdom of names, the Ancient Possessor of bounty in the heaven of eternity, and the Supreme Bestower of generosity in the realm of the unseen, and Thou hast been renowned for Thy grace above the Throne in the most exalted assembly. Say: The Beauty of the All-Merciful and the Countenance of Glory hath appeared in the temple of man. Blessed be God Who hath sent Him in truth and taught this Pen in the mystery of the line the wisdom of utterance, for verily He hath power over all things.\n\nO Solace of the Spirit! Recount unto men the bounty which We bestowed upon thee before the creation of all things in the atoms of eternity, and before the temples of all things were adorned with the mantle of names, at a time when the Adam of eternity was hidden in the clay of destiny by virtue of the Command. And should the opposition of the idolaters reach thee, grieve not, for We shall soon sanctify the hem of thy robe from the allusions of the manifestations of names and attributes, even as We have purified thee from the recognition of every wretched idolater. Stand firm then in the Cause, and speak forth between earth and heaven that wherewith We have caused the Spirit to speak within thy breast. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, in the eventide of holiness and the dawning of nearness, for He shall suffice thee in truth against every sinful oppressor. Turn unto God thy Lord, then turn away from all else, and verily We shall guard thee with the sovereignty of might and power, and preserve thee with an inviolability whereof no created thing hath any knowledge. Soon shall We manifest thy Cause and exalt thy name in the assemblage of names, and make mention of thee in the pavilion of holiness with a truthful and trustworthy tongue. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of the Cause and diversify for thee the signs, that the proof from thy Lord may be fulfilled unto all the worlds.\n\nO Supreme Remembrance of God! How can I make mention of the wonders of Thy remembrance wherewith Thou hast inspired me, when the idolaters have encompassed me from every side, and Thou art witness to this. By God! I have lost the thread in my affair and am bewildered by reason of the hatred that hath appeared in the breasts of those who believed not in Thee for the twinkling of an eye, and Thou art well aware of them. When I behold the wonders of Thy gifts and bounties toward me and my nearness to Thy Self, my spirit trembleth with longing for Thy presence, and when I turn my gaze toward my tribulations among Thy creatures, my very being is shaken with fear of Thy decree. Thou art in truth the Knower of all things and art cognizant of all things.\n\nO Quintessence of Immortality! Grieve not over anything, neither be thou afraid of anyone. Pour forth unto the denizens of the all-highest Paradise from the chalices of eternity, and unto the holy concourse of the Kingdom of Might from the crimson wine, and unto the dwellers of the pavilions of sovereignty and dominion from the white cups of this pure and most refined milk. Then unto the people of the human kingdom from the pitchers of divine decree, and unto the people of glory that which will sever them from all things and draw them to an ancient and holy retreat. Beware lest thou regard the idolaters and what their hands have wrought. Rather, gaze with the Most Exalted Vision upon thy Ancient and Eternal Beauty, Who hath dawned in truth from the horizon of the Most High Name, and verily He sufficeth thee above all else and will guard thee from the darts of the evil ones and will raise thee up in justice to a wondrous station of glory. For thou art indeed Hussein in the Kingdom of Names, and through Ali thou wert mentioned round about the Throne. And when the matter becometh grievous unto thee, sorrow not within thyself, but be patient in My path, for the reward of the patient ones hath been inscribed by the Pen of Holiness in the Mother Book. Say: The decree hath come through this Mandate, and He ordaineth what He willeth for all who are in the heavens and on earth, from the presence of One mighty and wise.\n\nO peoples of the earth! Do ye worship names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which God hath sent down no authority, and yet reject Him Who hath come unto you invested with mighty sovereignty? Fear God and follow not the promptings of your own selves, but rather follow God's command and His laws as revealed in the Bayan. Verily, all authority is with Him alone, and He is indeed the All-Knowing. Be not miserly with what God hath bestowed upon you through His grace; rather, spend of that which ye have been given. If ye are poor, God will enrich you from His bounty. Verily, He hath power over all things. God will soon reward those who have believed and have spent with the most excellent of rewards from His presence, and will cause them to enter an ancient and holy paradise.\n\nWhen We desired to conclude Our utterance, We heard a Call betwixt earth and heaven, saying: \"O Thou Beauty of the All-Glorious in the Most Resplendent Vesture! Withhold not from the ears the holy melodies, nor from the eyes the antimony of the knowledge of Thy beauty, nor from the suns the effulgences of the lights of Thy bounty, nor from the hearts the fragrances of Thy love, nor from all created things the outpourings of the flood of Thy mercy which doth encompass all worlds. Verily, the Maids of Paradise and the dwellers of the precincts of intimacy, and they that stand behind the Throne in holy places, have descended from the pavilions of eternity and have halted in the air above in this most holy and pure atmosphere, desiring to hear Thy sweet melodies in this most exalted station.\"\n\nBy God! Silence is beloved except concerning Thy wondrous melodies, and preservation is sought except in Thy mighty Cause, and patience is praiseworthy except in the face of Thy radiant and glorious Beauty. Thou art, of a truth, with Thy knowledge, well aware of what I say. By God, the Truth! Through Thy sorrowful utterances, the hearts of the faithful have been rent asunder, and the verses have returned to the dominion of truth, and the temples of names have been stripped of the raiment of attributes, and all things have been gathered in garments of grief between earth and heavens. Thou art, verily, the Powerful in judgment, doing what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty, and Thou art, indeed, powerful over all things.\n\nWhen We heard the Herald of the All-Merciful from the direction of the Divine Paradise, We ceased Our first melody and began another, that perchance they that are intoxicated among the malevolent ones might deal justly in this wondrous, most wondrous and exalted Cause, even less than an atom that moveth in this atmosphere, and might witness their Lord's power both in secret and in the open. Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth, even as He sent them down in truth upon 'Ali, and before him upon Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before him upon the Spirit, and before him upon Moses, testifying that there is none other God but Him. His is the command in the dominion of eternity. He causeth to live and die, then to die and live. Verily, He is the Everlasting that perisheth not, the Sovereign that declineth not, the King that fadeth not, the Manifest that is never hidden, and the Hidden that is never revealed. In His grasp is the kingdom of all things, and He is verily the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nO people! Fear God and deny not the signs of God, nor Him at Whose meeting the dwellers of the heavens and earth and all between them glory - the Concourse of the near ones who are sustained at every moment by the rays of Beauty shining upon them from the countenance of God, the Almighty, the All-Luminous. Say: O people! This is the Spirit of God amongst you and His sovereignty within you. Beware lest ye deny the signs of God after they have been sent down in truth like the descent of rain. Indeed, the rain descends and ceases, but the verses descend at all times in such wise that they never exhaust, and they who are endowed with holy vision testify that they have descended from the dominion of God, the Supreme, the All-Compelling. O people! If ye deny the signs of God, then by what testimony did ye believe in God on the day when the feet of every mystic slipped, the skin of every believer trembled, and eyes were dazzled? Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and dispute not with Him in Whom ye believed before. Be fair in your own selves and differ not regarding Him through Whom your names were exalted, and follow not every faithless calumniator. Say: Do ye take lords besides God and do as did the peoples of the Qur'an? Woe unto you for what your hands have wrought; soon shall ye return to your abode - and what abode for the wrongdoers save the fire? Say: Those who hearken unto the Word of God and are struck with yearning for it - these are they who drink the choice wine of holiness from the hand of this Youth, the One, the Eternal, the Ancient of Days, the Divine, Who hath come unto you upon the clouds of Command with sovereignty and power.\n\nO people of the Bayan! Do ye read the verses while denying their Revealer? By God the Truth! None hath done as ye have done, nor have any peoples committed what ye have committed. Woe unto you, O company of evil ones! Ye have indeed failed in your own selves, to such extent that ye have forgotten God's covenant, broken His testament, and turned away from Him by Whose command ye and the heavens and earth were created. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He sendeth down what He willeth to whom He willeth, and all things are decreed in His presence. Say: We counseled you in the Bayan not to deny the signs of God when they are sent down in truth. We revealed not the Bayan save for this Announcement which was inscribed with the choice wine of holiness upon tablets whereat vision turneth not back. Yet when We came to you again from the dawning-place of the Spirit, ye turned away from the Path, denied God's favor, and followed every doubtful denier. By God the Truth! None shall recognize Us today save those whose heart-mirrors are pure and whose vision is cleansed from beholding aught besides God. These are the companions of the Heights who recognize their Creator in every condition and hold fast to the Most Great Handle in this Most Firm, Most Pure Cord. Thus do We expound the verses for you and cast upon you that which shall make you independent of every treacherous associator. Say: O people! I fear not for Myself, but for Him Who shall come after Me on the day when the Fire shall be kindled and the Lights shall shine. By God the Truth! O people of the Bayan! Ye shall do unto Him what neither the people of the Qur'an did to 'Ali, nor the Christians to Muhammad, nor the Jews to Jesus, nor those who were before, before, unto God's Messengers. This is witnessed by what ye have done to this Servant after He came unto you with the sovereignty of the Cause, accompanied by a proof that would render powerless all possessed of knowledge and might\\[...\\]\n\nO people of the Bayan! Have ye forgotten the time when the Most Exalted One came unto you with sovereign authority from on high, and the divines of the Qur'an denied Him, until they pronounced their verdict against Him and put Him to death in such wise that the heavens and earth wept for Him, and those who are nigh unto God and the dwellers of the holy precincts of nearness lamented, and beyond them the very stones and trees mourned, while but few among you believed in Him? Then He returned once again that truth might be distinguished from falsehood. Thereupon ye denied and rejected Him until ye disbelieved in that which ye had formerly believed. God is sufficient witness between us and you, and He possesseth the knowledge of all mysteries. Say: In the most exalted Concourse ye are known for falsehood, in the heaven of eternity for polytheism, and in the kingdom of names for unbelief, for ye have disbelieved in God's verses after having used them as proof against others. Thus doth God reveal the treachery of souls and that which the breasts conceal. Among the polytheists are those who say these verses were not revealed according to nature. By the True God! Nature itself hath at this moment appeared in the form of a servant, and standeth at the gate in utmost submission, crying out and saying: \"Woe unto you, O company of the heedless! By God, I was created by His command.\" Thus doth it testify of itself, but these evil ones understand not. By God! It prideth itself in its connection with Our true Self, though We have ever been independent of it. We created it and all things by Our command, and none denieth this save every froward unbeliever. Thus have their lying tongues become so brazen that they say that which they understand not and forge lies against God. Say: Who is more unjust than one who forgeth lies against God and denieth His verses which were sent down in the nights and at dawn? Say: Die in your wrath! Today ye have no refuge except to deny what ye possess or to acknowledge that which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine decree by One mighty and free to choose. Say: Do ye speak as spoke the divines of the Qur'an? Are ye not ashamed before God Who created you and sustained you and made known unto you the Manifestation of His Self through verses that have bewildered minds and thoughts? O host of God! Purify your hearts from the mention of these people, then arise to aid God and His Cause. Take hold of God's Book with the power We have given you and pay no heed to the polytheists and what they say, for today they have no proof and naught shall profit them save the striking of necks by the swords of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. By God! O companions! Ye are God's swords if ye drink from this cup whereby souls are detached from all else save Him and raised to a station where nothing in the heavens and earth can frighten them, where neither their small numbers nor the multitude of the wicked can disturb them. For by God, besides Whom there is none other God, if one of you were to arise to aid Our Cause, God would make him triumph over a hundred thousand, and were his love to increase, God would make him prevail over all who are in the heavens and earth. Thus have We breathed at this moment the spirit of power throughout all regions that the dwellers of Paradise might draw strength therefrom in whatever region they may be, and aid God their Creator every night and day. Know ye that those whose hearts are attached to aught in the heavens and earth shall never enter My Kingdom, for God hath sanctified this station from all else and made it the habitation of the righteous. Therefore strive ye to attain this station\\[...\\]\n\nThey who deny God and His sovereignty in the heavens and on earth shall never enter My Kingdom, for God hath sanctified this station from all else and hath made it the habitation of the righteous. Strive ye, therefore, to attain unto this station, and deprive not yourselves of this bounty, and be ye not among the denizens of the fire. They who have denied God and His sovereignty - these shall be encompassed with abasement, and they shall have no protector from God. Soon shall the scourges of His wrath lay hold upon them from the presence of God, the Almighty, the Compelling. Thus have We sent down the verses unto you, and expounded the Cause, and made it subservient through that which We have manifested from this Most Exalted Pen, that it might serve as a reminder to the learned.\n\nKnow ye then, O people, that God hath made each letter of these words a paradise more vast than can be reckoned by all who dwell within the realm of possibility. And they who remain behind the veils of light at the manifestations of this Revelation, wherein are seated the Maids of inner meaning and utterance from the mysteries of this divine Youth Who is established upon the throne of forgiveness - were but the beauty of one of these to be unveiled before the dwellers of earth and heaven, all would be thunderstruck, nay, would cease to exist, save those who hold fast to the cord of the beauty of Him Who is peerless throughout creation in His all-bountiful Self, and in whose breast the Beauty of the Unseen speaketh at all times, saying: \"Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Most Generous.\"\n\nAnd when We desired to conclude Our utterance, We heard once again the call of the All-Merciful from the direction of the Throne above the celestial paradise, saying: \"O Ancient Beauty! I adjure Thee by My beauty, then by My light, then by My Cause, that Thou cease not Thy most sweet melodies, but rather give voice to the verses in yet another strain, for the people of the unseen from the worlds of the divine cloud long to hear Thy rapturous melodies. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Inaccessible, the All-Glorious.\"\n\nO Thou Who art the joy of the Cause! Make mention, beneath the canopy of light, of Our chosen servants in all regions, that perchance the melody of the All-Compelling may so confirm them in the Cause that they will never exchange the garment of the All-Possessing from their temples, and will arise to render victorious assistance through My Name, the Helper, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Glorious. Say: God's remembrance of His loved ones is sweeter than all that is sweet, and more precious than all that hath been created between the heavens and earth. By God! Were men to know the measure of what is being sent down unto them of the verses of God, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, they would sacrifice their very souls and expend their wealth in hope of but a single letter from the traces of their Lord. Even thus do We impart unto you of the wisdom of God, that ye may be of them that are endowed with understanding.\n\nO My Name! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord at the time when He ascended the throne with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things, that thou mayest remain steadfast in the Cause and be of them that attain. Know thou that We have been caught in the talons of hatred and find no helper for Ourself save God, my Lord and the Lord of all the worlds. There hath befallen Us that which hath never befallen God's chosen ones before, and the like of which no ear among all creatures hath ever heard. Thus do We impart unto thee tidings of the Spirit, that thou mayest aid Him as thou art able and be among them that are firm in His Cause. Say: Verily, He hath no need of anyone, and all victory lieth within His grasp. He aideth whom He willeth through His command, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. And if He commandeth the people to help, this is of His grace unto them that He may bring them to what He desireth. He, verily, is independent of all worlds. In His hand is the dominion of all things, and in His right hand is the empire of creation and command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Be thou steadfast, O servant, at a time when the people are intoxicated with this Most Great, this Mighty Announcement, such that they flee to the right and to the left, and place their fingers in their ears lest they hear the melodies whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were entranced and the minds of them that have recognized His oneness were bewildered. Thus have We recorded the matter in the Tablets of Destiny behind the veils of infallibility, and informed thee thereof in this manifest Tablet. Say: O people! This is God's mercy unto you, which hath encompassed all atoms. Have ye ever seen anything more wondrous than this? Nay, by thy Lord, the Most Merciful! Yet most of the people are behind mighty veils. Say: This is the breath of holiness wafting from the dayspring of the Cause. Have ye ever reckoned anything more excellent than this? Nay, by My bountiful Self, if ye be of them that are assured!\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! We have believed in that which hath been sent down from God in every age, and in 'Ali and in what was revealed unto Him of the signs of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and before Him in Muhammad the Messenger of God, and before Him in God's chosen ones and His Messengers who rent asunder the veils of creation and appeared from the horizon of the All-Merciful with clear sovereignty and a manifest and brilliant proof. Say: We have believed in them and in what they possessed of God's laws and His religion, then in God's ordinances and His command. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are preserved with Him in the tablets of might. Thus doth the servant testify for himself, and all existence, both seen and unseen, beareth witness unto this, if ye be of them that testify. Say: O people! By God, this is indeed 'Ali in truth Who hath appeared with a sovereignty the like of which hath never been witnessed by the eyes of those who dwell within pavilions of glory behind veils of light, much less the eyes of these oppressed ones. From His right hand flow the waters of life and from His left march forth the hosts of the All-Merciful. Exalted be this Man Who hath appeared at the heart of possibility with the beauty of the All-Glorious! Exalted be this most wondrous, most holy, most ancient, and everlasting Beauty!\n\nO Ancient Beauty! Make mention in the Book of Radiyyu'r-Ruh, that he may be well-pleased with himself and with what the clouds of holiness have sprinkled upon his heart from the rain of wondrous glory. Perchance the veils may be burned away by the fire which hath shone forth at the heart of contingent being, and the shrouds of idle fancy may be rent asunder by My sovereign might, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Say: O servant! Fear no one in the path of thy Lord. Take the chalice of life in thy right hand, then share it with those whom thou findest upon the shores of good-pleasure in this garden which hath appeared from the right hand of the All-Merciful. And shouldst thou find thyself powerless to bear the Word by reason of this Most Great Weight, then seek strength through My Name, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And if thine eye be too weak to pierce the dust of vain imaginings, then seek vision through My Name, the All-Seeing, the All-Perceiving, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Arise to serve the Cause, then take the staff We have given thee in the mystery of these words, and cleave asunder therewith the sea of idle fancies in these days wherein trembling hath seized all who are in the heavens and on earth, save whom thy Lord, the All-Merciful, willeth. Verily He protecteth whom He pleaseth, and He hath power over all things. Say: By God! The Beauty of the First One hath appeared yet again, and there hath shone forth from the light of His countenance, less than a needle's eye, upon all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thereupon did the dwellers of Sinai swoon away upon the elevated Mount by reason of this resplendent, this inaccessible Beauty, after We had informed them of this Cause in preserved tablets of glory. And thou, read thou what was sent down by Our First Beauty in the Qayyumu'l-Asma, that thou mayest know the mystery of the Cause in this Mystery which hath been veiled in secrets and concealed behind curtains through what the hands of the oppressors among these wicked ones have wrought. None knoweth this save God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. And shouldst thou become aware in the Book of the mysteries of thy Lord and recognize the decree of the Return after the first Return, beware lest thou reveal it to anyone or move thy tongue with it, for verily the people of the depths of eternity cannot bear to hear it; nay, they would instantly cease to be. Beware, beware! Conceal the beauty of the Cause from those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God. Behold thou the Ancient Beauty in the mirror of thy heart, then take comfort in Him and be of the thankful. Conceal the beauty of God from the eyes of the polytheists, and His mysteries from the hearts of the misguided. By God, the Truth! These are days wherein God hath tested all the Prophets and Messengers, then those who were behind the pavilions of infallibility and the canopy of grandeur and the tent of glory - how much more these polytheists who have taken their own selves for gods, and when the sovereignty of God and His power, then His grandeur and His majesty are made manifest unto them, they place the hand of rejection over their eyes, then hasten to practice deception that they might cause doubt among the servants. Thus do We cast upon thee that which will preserve thee from the darts of these satans. And if thou desirest to drink from this spring which hath flowed from the right hand of grace, and that which was promised thee at the heart of good-pleasure of camphor and salsabil, then detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and from all that hath been decreed by the rule of names in the kingdom of origination, that the gates of inner meanings and utterance might be opened unto thy heart and thou mayest become aware of the mysteries of the All-Merciful in this Paradise and be of those endued with certainty. O Radiyyu'r-Ruh! Reflect upon that which hath been sent down unto thee from the presence of One mighty and all-knowing, that thou mayest know what God desireth thee to know.\n\nO Rida'r-Ruh, ponder upon that which hath been sent down unto thee from the presence of One Who is mighty and all-knowing, that thou mayest recognize that which God desireth thee to know, and attain unto the station ordained for thee in the tablets of glory and bounty. Verily, We have sent unto thee this garment which hath been sprinkled with the blood of the truthful, that thou mayest perceive that which is hidden from the eyes of the world, save whom thy Lord willeth - they whom neither veils nor allusions can hinder, nor can any hindrance deter, even were it to appear in the form of the angels of heaven and the cherubim, for they behold with the Most Great Vision this Most Manifest Beauty and recognize the proof by its own self and not by aught else, for its evidence is in its verses and its existence is its proof. Thus hath it been, before and after, if ye be of them that know.\n\nO Delight of Eternity! Say: By God! We have not revealed in the tablets a single word in wondrous melody concerning that which We have cast upon the Pen from the mysteries of eternity, for We found the people of the Bayan in such intoxication, heedlessness and delusion as cannot be compared with any other people. Therefore hath the Temple of Grandeur veiled His most luminous and exalted Beauty with a thousand thousand veils of light, lest the eyes of these treacherous ones be drawn unto Him. Weep then for that which hath befallen Me at the hands of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and were among the heedless. By God! What We have suffered at the hands of the loved ones is far more grievous than what We have endured from the unbelievers. The heavens are well-nigh cleft asunder, the earth rent in twain, the mountains laid low, the pillars of the Throne demolished, the foundations of Paradise destroyed, and the hearts of them who are nigh unto God consumed, whereat the Pen of Command weepeth, the Immortal Dove lamenteth, and the Bird of Heaven crieth out, for that God willeth to prove His faith unto His servants after they were all created by His command - to this testifieth all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth. Say: O people! Verily, We have believed in God's Messengers and His chosen ones, and in that which hath been sent down unto them of the verses of God, the Mighty, the Revealer, the Bountiful. By what sin, then, have ye denied this outpouring, the like of which the clouds of Command have never borne, nor hath the rain of bounty attained unto it, nor have the eyes of them who are nigh beheld it?\n\nO Delight of Eternity! Turn the Pen away from the mention of these people, and bring not the treacherous ones beneath the pavilion of thy sweet remembrance. By God! All that floweth from thy pen is beloved in the sight of the denizens of the highest Paradise; therefore, it grieveth Me that thy precious fingers should move to record aught but thy wondrous and mighty mention. Thus, conclude the mention of the polytheists and begin with the mention of the sincere ones among thy loved ones, that perchance the wondrous melodies of thy sublime utterance may establish them upon thy mighty and exalted path. For the polytheists among the hypocrites desired to sow hatred in the hearts of the loved ones, upon whom the messages of eternity from the direction of Glory have passed. Thus have We reckoned up the matter in a perspicuous Book.\n\nO Rida'r-Ruh! Make mention of God's chosen ones who are in thy land, that they may rejoice within themselves that the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, hath moved upon their names.\n\nAnd among them is he who is named Muhammad - make mention of him from Our presence that he may glory therein among the worlds. Say: O servant! Efface from thy heart every remembrance save the remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Make My love thy stronghold, then My Cause thy mantle, then My remembrance thy shield, then My beauty thy companion, then thy trust in Me, the Bestower, the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.\n\nThen remember him who was named after My Name, that his name may endure in the heaven of grandeur and the kingdom of eternity, and that he may be of them that remember. Say: O servant! Give thanks unto God for having made thee the namesake of His Self and for sending upon thee the fragrances of the All-Merciful when thou wert present before the Throne, seated upon the seat of truth in the presence of the mighty and powerful King. Strive, then, that there may appear from thee in thy days that which befitteth this pure, exalted, and glorious Name. Remember thou thyself, then remember the servants through this blessed and luminous Name.\n\nThen remember Ha and Sin with the sovereignty of remembrance, that he may fall prostrate upon the dust before the countenance of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all who are in the realm of existence. Say: O Hasan! Do thou good even as God hath done good unto thee, then purify thyself for the revelation of His Self and thy heart from the promptings of them that join partners with God. Leave behind the world and all that is therein and thereon in thy shadow, then take shelter in My shadow which hath encompassed all created things and wherein dwell the sanctified concourse.\n\nThen remember Zaman with the verses of the All-Merciful which descend from the direction of a mighty throne. Say: O Zaman! First, detach thyself from time and all that is therein that thou mayest be enabled to ascend unto the heights of glory before thy Lord, the Gracious, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ancient. By God! Nothing shall profit thee this day save My love; lay fast hold upon it and be thou of them that are assured. And should abasement overtake thee for My Name's sake, grieve not but put thy trust in God, and verily He will guard thee from the harm of satans. Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord such that naught of all that hath been and shall be created may cause thee to slip, for this is the way of them that are steadfast. Then mention thy son from Our presence and adorn his brow with the crown of nearness from this brilliant and firm Pen.\n\nThen give glad tidings unto Rida with the tidings of the Spirit Who took refuge in the shadow of His Lord for months and years. Say: O servant! Grieve not at separation, for We have raised thee up before Us and inscribed thy name in the tablets of nearness among them that are nigh. Beware lest thou forget the melodies of thy Lord, His fragrances, and the lights of His beauty when they shine forth among you and illumine the people of the Supreme Concourse. Then remember his father and his son, then his brother and those with him who presented themselves before their Lord and unto whom the Face shone forth with sanctified and resplendent lights. Say: We have caused to gush forth for you from the mountain of holiness, in the mystery of this Ridvan, springs of Kawthar and Salsabil. Therefore, O people of the Bayan, deprive not yourselves but draw nigh unto it and be not of the patient ones. By God, the Truth! Ye have attained unto that which none before you hath attained, if ye but recognize the favor of God which hath descended upon you from the clouds of holiness and be of them that are firmly established. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon you and sent down upon you grace from every direction and from this holy, transcendent, and glorious Quarter.\n\nO Pen of Holiness! Remember the dust that he may remember within himself and turn unto the face of his Lord and be of them that are detached. Say: O servant! Rise above the dust and whatsoever proceedeth therefrom that thou mayest be enabled to know thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and be of them that attain. By God, the Truth! Today there is no refuge nor resting place for anyone save beneath the shadow of My luminous and mighty countenance, and at the gate of this Ridvan stand the angels of the Cause, stationed in My Name, the Protector, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. And should they detect in anyone the fragrance of the world and of whatsoever hath appeared between the heavens and the earth, they shall prevent him from entering this Ridvan and from standing before thy Lord, the Gracious, the Ancient. Thus doth the Dove teach thee, and those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the One, the Peerless.\n\nThen remind Hussein with that which the Spirit of Truth reminds him through manifest and holy verses, that he may soar in the atmosphere of nearness and know God, his Lord and the Lord of all worlds, in these days wherein no one has purified his countenance for the face of his Lord, and all worship vain imaginings as did the servants before them--thus it has been and ever shall be. The All-Merciful Himself is witness to what I say.\n\nThen make mention in the Book of Our other servants among the sanctified concourse. Say: Verily Hassan, then Ali before Nabil, then Hassan--all are among the righteous ones. Then Muhammad before Ali, then the servant before Ali, then Ali before Rida, then Our chosen servants--all are among the sincere ones. And for each has been ordained in the holy tablets that which none among the worlds can reckon. God Who created them and aided them in His Cause and made them know the Manifestation of His Self and made them to be among the believers. And they shall attain unto this station if they change not God's favor unto themselves; and should they change, God will change toward them. Verily there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are before Him in a perspicuous Book.\n\nSay: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Come forth from behind the veils of possibility and the shrouds of existence through the power of your Lord, the Bestower. Then stand firm in the Cause between the heavens and the earth in such wise that should all who are and all who shall be gather against you with all at their command to turn you from your purpose, they would prove powerless; nay rather, they would find themselves utterly impotent. Thus doth God establish the truth through His words and confirm the Cause through His verses, if ye be of those who know.\n\nTherefore, purify the mirrors of your hearts for the manifestation of the lights from this Beauty Who hath dawned in the Pole of Glory and Who shineth at the point of its setting with a radiance whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth are illumined, save those who have disbelieved in the signs of God, then denied His proof, disputed His tokens, and turned away from His beauty, and were among the heedless ones.\n\nSay: By God! The dwellers of Sinai were thunderstruck upon the Sinai of the Cause, and those veiled in clouds have fled from this divine Lion, and the spiritual ones shall perish in this terror wherein everything shall be struck with fear save those whom the hand of grace hath taken hold of, from the presence of One mighty and powerful.\n\nSay: O people! Read ye the words of God in the sweetest of melodies, that the denizens of earth and heaven may be drawn unto them. By the True One! Should anyone recite that which hath been sent down from the heaven of immortality by the All-Glorious Beauty of God, the Most Exalted, God will surely raise him up in the eternal Paradise with such beauty that the dwellers of the Supreme Concourse will be illumined by the light of his countenance. He will be visited by the inhabitants of the pavilions of holiness and by those who dwell within the tabernacle of concealment - they whose faces have never been beheld by the eyes of such as have denied the signs of the All-Merciful in this time wherein His sovereignty hath encompassed all created things, even every atom, if ye be of them that bear witness. Thus hath God ordained for every soul who readeth His verses; and besides this, He will raise them up at the dawning-place of every Manifestation, that He may perfect His favor upon them and upon all the worlds. Thus doth God reward His servants who remember Him with the best of rewards from His presence, and He verily is the Guardian of the virtuous.\n\nKnow thou moreover that they who have attained unto the presence of the Throne - these are they who have attained unto that which none besides them hath attained. Thus doth God bestow His grace upon whomsoever He willeth among His creation. There is no God but Him. He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. His is the bounty and the grace. He singleth out whom He pleaseth through His favor. There is no God but Him, the Munificent, the Mighty, the Beauteous.\n\nOf those whose names We have mentioned in the Tablet, some have soared unto the realms of holiness, while others have tarried at the threshold of this world. For each there is a portion with their Lord, and each is inscribed in mighty and glorious Tablets with Him. As for those whose names We have not mentioned, do thou remember them with the remembrances of the Spirit from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.\n\nIf thou art blessed with this Tablet wherein have been detailed the mysteries of what was and what is to be, arise from thy place, place it upon thy head and say:\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness with my tongue and my heart that Thy wondrous favor hath encompassed all atoms among all that hath been created between earth and heaven, such that nothing remaineth but that Thy proof hath been perfected unto it, Thy evidence hath shone upon it, Thy Word hath reached it, Thy sovereignty hath been manifested unto it, Thy verses have descended upon it, and the signs of Thy bounty have appeared unto it. Therefore, O my God, I have detached myself from all else save Thee and have arisen before the tabernacles of Thy glory and the pavilion of Thy grace, in such wise that I have purified my heart and my tongue from the love of aught else besides Thee and from the remembrance of any but Thee.\n\nWherefore, O my God, cause me to enter beneath the shadow of the tree of Thy oneness and the Lote-Tree of the majesty of Thy sovereign unity. Then grant me the sweetness of Thy verses and whatsoever lieth concealed therein of the pearls of Thy knowledge, which Thou hast ordained for Thy servants. Deprive me not, O my God, of the holy breezes that waft in the form of glad-tidings from the direction of Thy presence, and in the form of verses from the source of Thy favors. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Bestower, the Mighty, the Compassionate.\n\nThen make me steadfast, O my God, in Thy Cause whereon none can stand firm save those who have detached themselves from all that is in the heavens and the earth. Then establish for me, O my God, a seat of truth in Thy love and a station of glory at the manifestation of the lights of Thy countenance. Then join me with Thy sincere servants.\n\nThus have We taught thee and acquainted thee after We inspired thee, and shown thee after We informed thee, that thou mayest give thanks unto God thy Lord in thy heart and be in a state of joy and wondrous attraction. By My Beauty! Were but a single spark from the fire of longing which We have kindled in the sacred Lote-Trees upon the Sinai of these words to touch thee, it would draw thee unto a station wherein thou wouldst behold beneath thy shadow the kingdom of names and attributes, and wouldst find thyself in such an exaltation as could never be attained by the dwellers of earth and heaven. Thus hath the Ancient Pen inspired thee in this most ancient style, that thou mayest be among the steadfast.\n\nO Letter Jim! Go thou with this My shirt and cast it upon the face of all created things, that perchance the Daysprings of divine attributes may emerge from behind the veils and arise from beyond the clouds of glory, and may recognize Him Who hath come to them from the direction of immortality with manifest sovereignty. And thou, O Letter, must first purify thyself, then purify the people from the greatest defilement through this most pure Kawthar which We have caused to flow from the fountains of inner meanings, that thou mayest be a herald from Us unto all created beings. And be thou pure for God, thy Lord, in such wise that none shall perceive from thee any fragrance save His. Thus doth the Tongue of truth, the All-Knowing, command thee. And if thou hearkenest unto thy Lord's counsel, God will cause the water of life to flow from thy mouth, whereby He will revive every decomposed bone. Thus have We bestowed Our grace upon thee once again, that thou mayest be of them that are detached. And praise be to Him Who recognizeth his Lord in this luminous and manifest Shirt.\n\n=== END BH00052 ===\n\n=== START BH00053 ===\n\nThis is the Epistle of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting\n\nHe is God, exalted is He, the Lord of wisdom and utterance.\n\nPraise be unto God, incomparable in majesty, power and beauty, peerless in glory, might and grandeur; too high is He for human imaginations to comprehend Him or for any peer or equal to be ascribed unto Him. He hath clearly set forth His straight Path in words and utterances of highest eloquence. Verily He is the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.\n\nWhen He purposed to call the new creation into being, He sent forth the Manifest and Luminous Point from the horizon of His Will; it passed through every sign and manifested itself in every form until it reached the zenith, as bidden by God, the Lord of all men. This Point is the focal centre of the circle of Names and marketh the culmination of the manifestations of Letters in the world of creation.\n\nThrough it have appeared indications of the impenetrable Mystery, the adorned Symbol, He Who standeth revealed in the Most Great Name - a Name which is recorded in the luminous Tablet and is inscribed in the holy, the blessed, the snow-white Scroll. And when the Point was joined to the second Letter which appeareth in the beginning of the Mathani, it traversed the heavens of exposition and utterance.\n\nThen the eternal Light of God shed its radiance, flared up in the midmost heart of the firmament of testimony and produced two Luminaries. Glorified be the Merciful One, unto Whom no allusion can be made, Whom no expression can define, nor any assertion reveal, nor any evidence describe. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Bountiful, both in the beginning and in the end. And He provided for them protectors and defenders from among the hosts of power and might. Verily, He is the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.\n\nThe preamble of this Epistle is being revealed twice, even as was the Mathani.\n\nPraise be unto God Who hath manifested the Point, hath unfolded therefrom the knowledge of all things, whether of the past or of the future - a Point He hath chosen to be the Herald of His Name and the Harbinger of His Great Revelation which hath caused the limbs of all mankind to quake and the splendour of His light to shine forth above the horizon of the world.\n\nVerily, this is the Point which God hath ordained to be an ocean of light for the sincere among His servants and a flame of fire to the froward amidst His creatures and the impious among His people - they who bartered away the gift of God for unbelief, and the celestial food for hypocrisy, and led their associates to a wretched abode. These are the people who have manifested sedition throughout the world and have violated His Covenant on the Day when the immortal \\[...\\]\n\nAt one time He suffered imprisonment in the land of ?a (Tihran), at another in the land of Mim (Mazindaran), then again in the land of ?a (Tihran), and yet again in Mazindaran. In His love for the Cause of God He was subjected to chains and collars while thousands of people were gazing and watching. He, during many years, was cast into prison and was made to endure severe trials and hardships. In every land He had to taste the cup of tribulation and in every province He drank the brine of affliction. Some of our companions were martyred in 'Iraq, others were beheaded in Adhirbayjan, some wandered homeless and helpless through diverse regions, and yet others were confined in the barracks of the Land of Mim. Eventually most of them behaved in such a manner that they made the highest Paradise to weep and the people of the Divine Throne to lament, and still they did not wake from the sleep of heedlessness or cease from imputing things to God. Therefore did He Who is the King of divine power reveal these words - 'Verily I say, no one hath recognized Me while outwardly proclaiming belief in Me.' \\[...\\]\n\nland of Mim (Mazindaran), then once again in the former land, for the sake of the Cause of God, the Maker of the heavens. In His love for the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, He was subjected there to chains and fetters. O people of the Bayan! Have ye forgotten My exhortations, which My Pen hath revealed and My tongue hath uttered? Have ye bartered away My certitude in exchange for your idle fancies and My Way for your selfish desires? Have ye cast away the precepts of God and His remembrance and have ye forsaken His laws and ordinances? Fear ye God and abandon vain imaginings to the begetters thereof and leave superstitions to the devisers thereof and misgivings to the breeders thereof. Advance ye then with radiant faces and stainless hearts towards the horizon above which the Day-Star of certitude shineth resplendent at the bidding of God, the Lord of Revelations.\n\nPraise be unto God Who hath made the Most Great Infallibility the shield for the temple of His Cause in the realm of creation, and hath assigned unto no one a share of this lofty and sublime station - a station which is a vesture which the fingers of transcendent power have woven for His august Self. It befitteth no one except Him Who is seated upon the mighty throne of 'He doeth what He pleaseth'. Whoso accepteth and recognizeth that which is written down at this moment by the Pen of Glory is indeed reckoned in the Book of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end, among the exponents of divine unity, they that uphold the concept of the oneness of God.\n\nWhen the stream of words reached this stage, the sweet savours of true knowledge were shed abroad and the day-star of divine unity shone forth above the horizon of His holy utterance. Blessed is he whom His Call hath attracted to the summit of glory, who hath drawn nigh to the ultimate Purpose, and who hath recognized through the shrill voice of My Pen of Glory that which the Lord of this world and of the next hath willed. Whoso faileth to quaff the choice wine which We have unsealed through the potency of Our Name, the All-Compelling, shall be unable to discern the splendours of the light of divine unity or to grasp the essential purpose underlying the Scriptures of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, the sovereign Ruler of this world and of the world to come. Such a man shall be accounted among the faithless in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO thou honoured enquirer! We bear witness that thou didst firmly adhere unto seemly patience during the days when the Pen was held back from movement and the Tongue hesitated to set forth an explanation regarding the wondrous sign, the Most Great Infallibility. Thou hast \\[...\\]\n\nasked this Wronged One to remove for thee its veils and coverings, to elucidate its mystery and character, its state and position, its excellence, sublimity and exaltation. By the life of God! Were We to unveil the pearls of testimony which lie hid within the shells of the ocean of knowledge and assurance or to let the beauties of divine mystery which are hidden within the chambers of utterance in the Paradise of true understanding, step out of their habitation, then from every direction violent commotion would arise among the leaders of religion and thou wouldst witness the people of God held fast in the teeth of such wolves as have denied God both in the beginning and in the end. Therefore We restrained the Pen for a considerable lapse of time in accordance with divine wisdom and for the sake of protecting the faithful from those who have bartered away heavenly blessings for disbelief and have chosen for their people the abode of perdition.\n\nO thou seeker who art gifted with keen insight. I swear by Him who attracted the Concourse on High through the potency of His most sublime Word! Verily the birds abiding within the domains of My Kingdom and the doves dwelling in the rose-garden of My wisdom utter such melodies and warblings as are inscrutable to all but God, the Lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven; and were these melodies to be revealed even to an extent smaller than a needle's eye, the people of tyranny would utter such calumnies as none among former generations hath ever uttered, and would commit such deeds as no one in past ages and centuries hath ever committed. They have rejected the bounty of God and His proofs and have repudiated the testimony of God and His signs. They have gone astray and have caused the people to go astray, yet perceive it not. They worship vain imaginings but know it not. They have taken idle fancies for their lords and have neglected God, yet understand not. They have abandoned the most great Ocean and are hastening towards the pool, but comprehend not. They follow their own idle fancies while turning aside from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nSay, by the righteousness of God! The All-Merciful is come invested with power and sovereignty. Through His power the foundations of religions have quaked and the Nightingale of Utterance hath warbled its melody upon the highest branch of true understanding. Verily, He Who was hidden in the knowledge of God and is mentioned in the Holy Scriptures hath appeared. Say, this is the Day when the Speaker on Sinai hath mounted the throne of Revelation and the people have stood before the Lord of the worlds. This is the Day wherein the earth hath told out her tidings and hath laid bare her treasures; when the oceans \\[...\\]\n\nhave brought forth their pearls and the divine Lote-Tree its fruit; when the Sun hath shed its radiance and the Moons have diffused their lights, and the Heavens have revealed their stars, and the Hour its signs, and the Resurrection its dreadful majesty; when the pens have unloosed their outpourings and the spirits have laid bare their mysteries. Blessed is the man who recognizeth Him and attaineth His presence, and woe betide such as deny Him and turn aside from Him. I beseech God to aid His servants to return unto Him. Verily He is the Pardoner, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nO thou who hast set thy face towards the Realm on High and hast quaffed My sealed wine from the hand of bounteousness! Know thou that the term 'Infallibility' hath numerous meanings and divers stations. In one sense it is applicable to the One Whom God hath made immune from error. Similarly it is applied to every soul whom God hath guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion, impiety, disbelief and the like. However, the Most Great Infallibility is confined to the One Whose station is immeasurably exalted beyond ordinances or prohibitions and is sanctified from errors and omissions. Indeed He is a Light which is not followed by darkness and a Truth not overtaken by error. Were He to pronounce water to be wine or heaven to be earth or light to be fire, He speaketh the truth and no doubt would there be about it; and unto no one is given the right to question His authority or to say why or wherefore. Whosoever raiseth objections will be numbered with the froward in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. 'Verily He shall not be asked of His doings but all others shall be asked of their doings.' He is come from the invisible heaven, bearing the banner 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth' and is accompanied by hosts of power and authority while it is the duty of all besides Him to strictly observe whatever laws and ordinances have been enjoined upon them, and should anyone deviate therefrom, even to the extent of a hair's breadth, his work would be brought to naught.\n\nConsider thou and call to mind the time when Muhammad appeared. He said, and His word is the truth: 'Pilgrimage to the House is a service due to God.' And likewise are the daily prayer, fasting, and the laws which shone forth above the horizon of the Book of God, the Lord of the World and the true Educator of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. It is incumbent upon everyone to obey Him in whatsoever God hath ordained; and whosoever denieth Him hath disbelieved in God, in His verses, in His Messengers and in His Books. Were He to pronounce \\[...\\]\n\nO my God! O my God! I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast caused me to believe in Him and hast enabled me to recognize the sovereignty of Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy signs, hast dilated my breast through utterance of Thy praise in the kingdom of Thy names and inspired me to teach Thy Cause amongst Thy creatures and to extol Thy virtues amidst Thy servants. I beseech Thee, by the seas of knowledge which lie hidden in Thy heavenly self and by the stars that diffuse their light in the firmament of Thy command, to graciously aid me in that which will draw me nearer unto Thee and will profit me in every world of Thine. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nPraise be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I am the one who hath turned his face towards Thee and hath placed his whole reliance in Thee. I implore Thee by Thy Name whereby the ocean of Thine utterance hath surged and the breezes of Thy knowledge have stirred, to grant that I may be graciously aided to serve Thy Cause and be inspired to remember Thee and praise Thee. Send down then upon me from the heaven of Thy generosity that which will preserve me from anyone but Thee and will profit me in all Thy worlds.\n\nVerily, Thou art the Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Supreme, the Knowing, the Wise.\n\nBlessed be Thou, O Lord of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens, inasmuch as Thou hast, through the power of Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, given me to drink of Thy sealed wine, hast caused me to draw nigh unto Thee and hast enabled me to recognize the Dayspring of Thine utterance, the Manifestation of Thy signs, the Fountainhead of Thy laws and commandments and the Source of Thy wisdom and bestowals. Blessed is the land that hath been ennobled by Thy footsteps, wherein the throne of Thy sovereignty is established and the fragrance of Thy raiment is diffused.\n\nBy Thy glory and majesty, by Thy might and power, I desire not my sight save to behold Thy beauty, nor my hearing save to hearken to Thy call and Thy verses.\n\nO my God! O my God! Debar not the eyes from that for which Thou hast created them, nor the faces from turning to Thy horizon, or from paying homage at the portals of Thy majesty, or from appearing in the presence of Thy throne, or from bowing down before the splendours of the Day-Star of Thy bounty.\n\nI am the one, O Lord, whose heart and soul, whose limbs, whose inner and outer tongue testify to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and bear witness that Thou art God and that there is no God but Thee. Thou didst bring mankind into being to know Thee and to serve Thy Cause, that their station might thereby be elevated upon Thine earth and their souls be uplifted by virtue of the things Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy Tablets.\n\nYet no sooner didst Thou manifest Thyself and reveal Thy signs than they turned away from Thee and repudiated Thee and rejected that which Thou didst unveil before their eyes through the potency of Thy might and Thy power. They rose up to inflict harm upon Thee, to extinguish Thy light and to put out the flame that blazeth in Thy Burning Bush. Their iniquity waxed so grievous that they conspired to shed Thy blood and to violate Thy honour.\n\nAnd likewise acted he whom Thou hadst nurtured with the hand of Thy loving-kindness, hadst protected from the mischief of the rebellious among Thy creatures and the froward amidst Thy servants, and whom Thou hadst set the task of writing Thy holy verses before Thy throne. Alas! Alas! for the things he perpetrated in Thy days to such an extent that he violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, rejected Thy holy Writ, rose up in rebellion and committed that which caused the denizens of Thy Kingdom to lament. Then no sooner had he found his hopes shattered and had perceived the odour of utter failure than he raised his voice and gave tongue to that \\[...\\]\n\nwhich caused Thy chosen ones, who are nigh unto Thee, and the inmates of the pavilion of glory, to be lost in bewilderment. Thou seest me, O my God, writhing in anguish upon the dust, like unto a fish. Deliver me, have mercy upon me, O Thou Whose aid is invoked by all men, O Thou within Whose grasp lie the reins of power over all men and women. Whenever I ponder my grievous shortcomings and my great trespasses, despair assaileth me from every direction, and whenever I pause to meditate upon the ocean of Thy bounteousness and the heaven of Thy grace and the day-star of Thy tender compassion, I inhale the fragrance of hope diffused from right and left, from north and south, as if every created thing imparteth unto me the joyous tidings that the clouds of the heaven of Thy mercy will pour down their rain upon me. By Thy might, O Thou Who art the Mainstay of the sincere ones and the Desire of them that enjoy near access unto Thee! Thy manifold favours and blessings and the revelations of Thy grace and loving-kindness have truly emboldened me. How, otherwise, can utter nothingness magnify the Name of Him Who hath, by a word, brought creation into being, and how can an evanescent creature extol Him Who hath demonstrated that no description can ever express Him and no word of praise magnify His glory? He hath from everlasting been immeasurably exalted above the understanding of His creatures and sanctified from the conceptions of His servants.\n\nO Lord! Thou beholdest this lifeless one before Thy face; suffer him through Thy generosity and bountiful favour, not to be deprived of the chalice of immortal life. And Thou seest this afflicted one standing before Thy throne; turn him not away from the ocean of Thy healing. I entreat Thee to enable me at all times and under all conditions to remember Thee, to magnify Thy Name and to serve Thy Cause, though I am well aware that whatever proceedeth from a servant cannot transcend the limitations of his soul, nor beseem Thy Lordship, nor be worthy of the court of Thy glory and Thy majesty.\n\nThy might beareth me witness! Were it not to celebrate Thy praise, my tongue would be of no use to me, and were it not for the sake of rendering service to Thee, my existence would avail me not. But for the pleasure of beholding the splendours of Thy realm of glory, why should I cherish sight? And but for the joy of giving ear to Thy most sweet voice, of what use is hearing?\n\nAlas! Alas! I know not, O my God, my Mainstay, my heart's Desire, whether Thou hast ordained for me that which shall bring solace to mine eyes, gladden my bosom and rejoice my heart, or whether Thine irrevocable decree, \\[...\\]\n\nO King of eternity and the sovereign Lord of all nations, will debar me from presenting myself before Thy throne. I swear by Thy glory and majesty and by Thy dominion and power, the darkness of my remoteness from Thee hath destroyed me. What hath become of the light of Thy nearness, O Desire of every understanding heart? The tormenting agony of separation from Thee hath consumed me. Where is the effulgent light of Thy reunion, O Well-Beloved of such as are wholly devoted to Thee? Thou seest, O my God, what hath befallen me in Thy Path at the hand of those who have denied Thy Truth, have violated Thy Covenant, cavilled at Thy signs, rejected the blessings Thou didst vouchsafe, disbelieved the verses Thou didst send down and have refused to acknowledge the testimony Thou didst fulfil.\n\nO Lord! The tongue of my tongue and the heart of my heart and the spirit of my spirit and my outward and inmost beings bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, Thy power and Thine omnipotence, Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty, and attest Thy glory, loftiness and authority. I testify that Thou art God and that there is none other God besides Thee. From everlasting Thou hast been a treasure hidden from the sight and minds of men and shalt continue to remain the same for ever and ever. The powers of earth can never frustrate Thee, nor can the might of the nations alarm Thee.\n\nThou art the One Who hath unlocked the door of knowledge before the faces of Thy servants that they may recognize Him Who is the Day-Star of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, the Heaven of Thy manifestation and the Sun of Thy divine beauty. In Thy holy Books, in Thy Scriptures and Thy Scrolls Thou hast promised all the peoples of the world that Thou Thyself shalt appear and shalt remove the veils of glory from Thy face, even as Thou didst announce in Thy words unto Thy Friend through Whom the Day-Star of Revelation shone brightly above the horizon of Hijaz, and the dawning light of divine Truth shed its radiance among all men, proclaiming: 'The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.' And before Muhammad Thou didst impart this glad tiding unto Him Who conversed with Thee, saying: 'Bring forth thy people from the darkness into the light and remind them of the days of God.' Moreover Thou didst proclaim this truth unto the Spirit and unto Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, whether of the remote or more recent past. If all that which Thou hast sent down in glorification of this Most Great Remembrance, this Great Announcement, were to stream forth from the wellspring of Thy most august Pen, the inmates of the cities of knowledge and understanding would be dumbfounded, except such as Thou wouldst deliver through the potency of Thy might \\[...\\]\n\nand wouldst protect as a token of Thy bountiful favour and Thy grace. I bear witness that Thou hast in truth fulfilled Thy pledge and hast made manifest the One Whose advent was foretold by Thy Prophets, Thy chosen ones and by them that serve Thee. He hath come from the heaven of glory and power, bearing the banners of Thy signs and the standards of Thy testimonies. Through the potency of Thine indomitable power and strength, He stood up before the faces of all men and summoned all mankind to the summit of transcendent glory and unto the all-highest Horizon, in such wise that neither the oppression of the ecclesiastics nor the onslaught of the rulers was able to deter Him. He arose with inflexible resolve and, unloosing His tongue, proclaimed in ringing tones: 'He Who is the All-Bountiful is come, riding aloft on the clouds. Advance, O people of the earth, with shining faces and radiant hearts!'\n\nGreat indeed is the blessedness of him who attaineth Thy presence, drinketh the wine of reunion proffered by the hand of Thy bounteousness, inhaleth the fragrance of Thy signs, unlooseth his tongue in celebrating Thy praise, soareth high in Thy heavens, is carried away by the sweetness of Thy Voice, gaineth admittance into the most exalted Paradise and attaineth the station of revelation and vision before the throne of Thy majesty.\n\nI beg of Thee by the Most Great Infallibility which Thou hast chosen to be the dayspring of Thy Revelation, and by Thy most sublime Word through whose potency Thou didst call the creation into being and didst reveal Thy Cause, and by this Name which hath caused all other names to groan aloud and the limbs of the sages to quake, I beg of Thee to make me detached from all else save Thee, in such wise that I may move not but in conformity with the good-pleasure of Thy Will, and speak not except at the bidding of Thy Purpose, and hear naught save the words of Thy praise and Thy glorification.\n\nI magnify Thy Name, O my God, and offer thanksgiving unto Thee, O my Desire, inasmuch as Thou hast enabled me to clearly perceive Thy straight Path, hast unveiled Thy Great Announcement before mine eyes and hast aided me to set my face towards the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Fountainhead of Thy Cause, whilst Thy servants and Thy people turned away from Thee. I entreat Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of eternity, by the shrill voice of the Pen of Glory, and by the Burning Fire which calleth aloud from the verdant Tree, and by the Ark which Thou hast specially chosen for the people of Baha, to grant that I may remain steadfast in my love for Thee, be well pleased with whatsoever Thou hast prescribed for me in Thy Book and may stand firm in Thy service and in \\[...\\]\n\nthe service of Thy loved ones. Graciously assist then Thy servants, O my God, to do that which will serve to exalt Thy Cause and will enable them to observe whatsoever Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Lord of Strength, Thou art potent to ordain whatsoever Thou willest and within Thy grasp Thou holdest the reins of all created things. No God is there but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Jalil! We have unveiled to thine eyes the sea and the waves thereof, the sun and the radiance thereof, the heavens and the stars thereof, the shells and the pearls thereof. Render thou thanks unto God for so great a bounty, so gracious a favour that hath pervaded the whole world.\n\nO thou who hast set thy face towards the splendours of My Countenance! Vague fancies have encompassed the dwellers of the earth and debarred them from turning towards the Horizon of Certitude, and its brightness, and its manifestations and its lights. Vain imaginings have withheld them from Him Who is the Self-Subsisting. They speak as prompted by their own caprices, and understand not. Among them are those who have said: 'Have the verses been sent down?' Say 'Yea, by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens!' 'Hath the Hour come?' 'Nay, more; it hath passed, by Him Who is the Revealer of clear tokens! Verily, the Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath appeared with proof and testimony. The Plain is disclosed, and mankind is sore vexed and fearful. Earthquakes have broken loose, and the tribes have lamented, for fear of God, the Lord of Strength, the All-Compelling.' Say: 'The stunning trumpet-blast hath been loudly raised, and the Day is God's, the One, the Unconstrained.' And they say: 'Hath the Catastrophe come to pass?' Say: 'Yea, by the Lord of Lords!' 'Is the Resurrection come?' 'Nay, more; He Who is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the Kingdom of His signs.' 'Seest thou men laid low?' 'Yea, by my Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious!' 'Have the tree-stumps been uprooted?' 'Yea, more; the mountains have been scattered in dust; by Him the Lord of attributes!' They say: 'Where is Paradise, and where is Hell?' Say: 'The one is reunion with Me; the other thine own self, O thou who dost associate a partner with God and doubtest.' They say: 'We see not the Balance.' Say: 'Surely, by my Lord, the God of Mercy! None can see it except such as are endued with insight.' They say: 'Have the stars fallen?' Say: 'Yea, when He Who is the Self-Subsisting dwelt in the Land of Mystery. Take heed, ye who are endued with discernment!' All the signs appeared when We drew forth the Hand of Power from the bosom \\[...\\]\n\nThese are verses We sent down previously, and We have sent them unto thee, that thou mayest be acquainted with what their lying tongues have spoken, when God came unto them with might and sovereignty. Among them is he who saith: 'Have the verses been sent down?' Say: 'Yea, by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens!' \\[...\\]\n\n\\]\n\ncame unto them with might and sovereignty. The foundations of idle fancies have trembled, and the heaven of vain imaginings hath been cleft asunder, and yet the people are in doubt and in contention with Him. They have denied the testimony of God and His proof, after He came from the heaven of power with the kingdom of His signs. They have cast away what had been prescribed, and perpetrated what had been forbidden them in the Book. They have abandoned their God, and clung unto their desires. They truly have strayed and are in error. They read the verses and deny them. They behold the clear tokens and turn aside. They truly are lost in strange doubt.\n\nWe have admonished Our loved ones to fear God, a fear which is the fountainhead of all goodly deeds and virtues. It is the commander of the hosts of justice in the city of Baha. Happy the man that hath entered the shadow of its luminous standard, and laid fast hold thereon. He, verily, is of the Companions of the Crimson Ark, which hath been mentioned in the Qayyum-i-Asma.\n\nSay: O people of God! Adorn your temples with the adornment of trustworthiness and piety. Help, then, your Lord with the hosts of goodly deeds and a praiseworthy character. We have forbidden you dissension and conflict in My Books, and My Scriptures, and My Scrolls, and My Tablets, and have wished thereby naught else save your exaltation and advancement. Unto this testify the heavens and the stars thereof, and the sun and the radiance thereof, and the trees and the leaves thereof, and the seas and the waves thereof, and the earth and the treasures thereof. We pray God to assist His loved ones, and aid them in that which beseemeth them in this blest, this mighty, and wondrous station. Moreover We beseech Him to graciously enable those who surround Me to observe that which My Pen of Glory hath enjoined upon them.\n\nO Jalil! Upon thee be My glory and My loving providence. Verily We have enjoined the people to do what is meet and seemly and yet they have committed such things as have caused My heart and My Pen to lament. Incline thine ear to that which is sent down from the heaven of My Will and the realm of My good-pleasure. I sorrow not for My captivity, nor for the things that have befallen Me at the hand of Mine enemies. Nay, My sorrows are occasioned by those who claim to be related to Me and yet commit that which causeth the voice of My lamentations to be lifted up and My tears to flow. We have exhorted them at length in various Tablets and beseech God to graciously assist them, to enable them to draw nigh unto Him and to confirm them in that which would bring peace \\[...\\]\n\nto the hearts and tranquillity to the souls and would stay their hands from whatsoever ill-beseemeth His days. Say, O My loved ones in My lands! Give ye ear unto the counsels of Him Who admonisheth you for the sake of God. He hath in truth created you, hath revealed before your eyes that which exalteth you and promoteth your interests. He hath made known unto you His straight Path and hath acquainted you with His Great Announcement.\n\nO Jalil! Admonish men to fear God. By God! This fear is the chief commander of the army of thy Lord. Its hosts are a praiseworthy character and goodly deeds. Through it have the cities of men's hearts been opened throughout the ages and centuries, and the standards of ascendancy and triumph raised above all other standards.\n\nWe will now mention unto thee Trustworthiness and the station thereof in the estimation of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day of days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen is powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of light, and calling aloud saying: 'O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God, the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most great ornament of the people of Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.' Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the Lord of creation.\n\nThe Pen of the Most High turneth from the eloquent language to the luminous one that thou, O Jalil, mayest appreciate the tender mercy of thy Lord, the Incomparable One and mayest be of them that are truly grateful.\n\nO thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the all-glorious Horizon! The Call is raised but hearing ears are numbered, nay non-existent. This Wronged One findeth himself in the maw of the serpent, yet He faileth not to make mention of the loved ones of God. So grievous have been Our sufferings in these days that the Concourse on High are \\[...\\]\n\nThe earliest generation hath passed away, who wrongfully associated partners with Him despite their profession in His unity - and notwithstanding being the most \\[...\\]\n\nThey, verily, are the manifestations of the power of God and the daysprings of His authority. We beseech the Almighty that He may graciously assist them in that which is conducive to the well-being of their subjects. A full exposition of this matter hath been previously set forth by the Pen of Glory; well is it with them that act accordingly.\n\nThe third Ishraq\n\nIt is incumbent upon everyone to observe God's holy commandments, inasmuch as they are the wellspring of life unto the world. The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion, and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward and punishment.\n\nThe fourth Ishraq\n\nIn this Revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts of praiseworthy deeds and upright character. The leader and commander of these hosts hath ever been the fear of God, a fear that encompasseth all things and reigneth over all things.\n\nThe fifth Ishraq\n\nGovernments should be well acquainted with the condition of their subjects and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit. It is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy. \\[...\\]\n\nThe power of God and the daysprings of His authority.

It is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy.\n\nAmong the officials who in the past have governed in this Most Great Prison some, praise be to God, were adorned with justice, but as to others, We take refuge with God. We beseech the One true God to guide them one and all, that haply they may not be deprived of the fruit of faith and trustworthiness, nor be withheld from the light of equity and justice.\n\nThe sixth Ishraq\n\nis union and concord amongst the children of men. From the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its divine radiance upon the world, and the greatest means for the promotion of that unity is for the peoples of the world to understand one another's writing and speech. In former Epistles We have enjoined upon the Trustees of the House of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new one, and in like manner to select a common script, both of which should be taught in all the schools of the world. Thus will the earth be regarded as one country and one home. The most glorious fruit of the tree of knowledge is this exalted word: Of one tree are all ye the fruit, and of one bough the leaves. Let not man glory in this that he loveth his country, let him rather glory in this that he loveth his kind. Concerning this We have previously \\[...\\]\n\nwhich is the means of the reconstruction of the world and the unity of nations. Blessed are they that attain thereunto. Blessed are they that act accordingly.\n\nThe seventh Ishraq\n\nThe Pen of Glory counselleth everyone regarding the instruction and education of children. Behold that which the Will of God hath revealed upon Our arrival in the Prison City and recorded in the Most Holy Book. Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily, have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My Loving-Kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world.\n\nThe eighth Ishraq\n\nThis passage, now written by the Pen of Glory, is accounted as part of the Most Holy Book: The men of God's House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.\n\nO people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.\n\nO people of Baha! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain \\[...\\]\n\ntrue education in the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.\n\nThe ninth Ishraq\n\nThe purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God's holy Will is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world; make it not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion of God and His divine law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The progress of the world, the development of nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of God. Religion bestoweth upon man the most precious of all gifts, offereth the cup of prosperity, imparteth eternal life, and showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind.\n\nIt behoveth the chiefs and rulers of the world, and in particular the Trustees of God's House of Justice, to endeavour to the utmost of their power to safeguard its position, promote its interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the world. In like manner it is incumbent upon them to enquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint themselves with the affairs and activities of the divers communities in their dominions.\n\nWe call upon the manifestations of the power of God - the sovereigns and rulers on earth - to bestir themselves and do all in their power that haply they may banish discord from this world and illumine it with the light of concord.\n\nIt is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to and observe that which hath streamed forth from Our Most Exalted Pen. God, the True One, beareth Me witness, and every atom in existence is moved to testify that such means as lead to the elevation, the advancement, the education, the protection and the regeneration of the peoples of the earth have been clearly set forth by Us and are revealed in the Holy Books and Tablets by the Pen of Glory. We entreat God to graciously aid His servants.\n\nWhat this Wronged One doth expect from everyone is justice and fairness. Let no one be content with mere hearing; rather doth it behove everyone to ponder that which this Wronged One hath revealed. I swear by the Day-Star of utterance, shining above the horizon of the Kingdom of the All-Merciful, had there been any expounder or speaker discernible, We would not have made Ourself the object of the censure, ridicule and slander of the people.\n\nUpon Our arrival in 'Iraq We found the Cause of God sunk in deep apathy and the breeze of divine revelation stilled. Most of the believers were faint and dispirited, nay \\[...\\]\n\nutterly lost and dead. Hence there was a second blast on the Trumpet, whereupon the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these blessed words: 'We have sounded the Trumpet for the second time.' Thus the whole world was quickened through the vitalizing breaths of divine revelation and inspiration. Certain souls have now sallied forth from behind the veils, intent on inflicting harm upon this Wronged One. They have hindered and denied the outpouring of this priceless bounty. O ye that judge with fairness! If this Cause is to be denied then what other cause in this world can be vindicated or deemed worthy of acceptance?\n\nSuch as have turned away from the Cause of God are diligently seeking to collect the Holy Writings of this Revelation; and they have already, through gestures of friendship, managed to secure certain of these Writings from those who held them in their possession. Moreover, when they meet the followers of any religion, they hold themselves out as believers therein. Say, die ye in your wrath! Verily He hath appeared with so great an authority that no man of vision, of hearing, of insight, of justice or of equity can ever deny Him. Unto this beareth witness in this resplendent Hour the Pen of Him Who is the Ancient of Days.\n\nO Jalil! Upon thee be My glory. We exhort the loved ones of God to perform good deeds that perchance they may be graciously assisted and may hold fast to that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His Revelation. The benefits arising from this divine utterance shall fall upon such as observe His precepts. We beseech God to enable them to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him, to grant that they may deal equitably and may observe justice in this all-compelling Cause, to acquaint them with His Holy Writings and to direct their steps towards His straight Path.\n\nOur Exalted Herald - may the life of all else besides Him be offered up for His sake - hath revealed certain laws. However, in the realm of His Revelation these laws were made subject to Our sanction, hence this Wronged One hath put some of them into effect by embodying them in the Kitab-i-Aqdas in different words. Others We set aside. He holdeth in His hand the authority. He doeth what He willeth and He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Praised. There are also ordinances newly revealed. Blessed are they that attain. Blessed are they that observe His precepts.\n\nThe people of God should make the utmost endeavour that perchance the fire of hatred and malice which smouldereth in the breasts of kindreds and peoples may, through the living waters of utterance and the exhortations of Him Who is the Desire of the world, be quenched and the trees of human existence may be adorned with wondrous and \\[...\\]\n\nexcellent fruit. He is, in truth, the Admonisher, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. May the brightness of His glory shining above the horizon of bounty rest upon you, O people of Baha, upon every one who standeth firm and steadfast and upon those that are well grounded in the Faith and are endued with true understanding.\n\nAs to thy question concerning interest and profit on gold and silver: Some years ago the following passage was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful in honour of the one who beareth the name of God, entitled Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin - upon him be the glory of the Most Glorious. He - exalted be His Word - saith: Many people stand in need of this. Because if there were no prospect for gaining interest, the affairs of men would suffer collapse or dislocation. One can seldom find a person who would manifest such consideration towards his fellow-man, his countryman or towards his own brother and would show such tender solicitude for him as to be well-disposed to grant him a loan on benevolent terms.\n\nTherefore as a token of favour towards men We have prescribed that interest on money should be treated like other business transactions that are current amongst men. Thus, now that this lucid commandment hath descended from the heaven of the Will of God, it is lawful and proper to charge interest on money, that the people of the world may, in a spirit of amity and fellowship and with joy and gladness, devotedly engage themselves in magnifying the Name of Him Who is the Well-Beloved of all mankind. Verily He ordaineth according to His Own choosing. He hath now made interest on money lawful, even as He had made it unlawful in the past. Within His grasp He holdeth the kingdom of authority. He doeth and ordaineth. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.\n\nRender thou thanks unto thy Lord, O Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, for this manifest bounty. Many ecclesiastics in Persia have, through innumerable designs and devices, been feeding on illicit gains obtained by usury. They have contrived ways to give its outward form a fair semblance of lawfulness. They make a plaything of the laws and ordinances of God, but they understand not.\n\nHowever, this is a matter that should be practised with moderation and fairness. Our Pen of Glory hath, as a token of wisdom and for the convenience of the people, desisted from laying down its limit. Nevertheless We exhort the loved ones of God to observe justice and fairness, and to do that which would prompt the friends of God to evince tender mercy and compassion towards each other. He is in truth the Counsellor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. God grant that all men may be graciously aided to observe that which the Tongue of the One true God hath uttered. And if they put into practice what We have set \\[...\\]\n\nforth, God - exalted be His glory - will assuredly double their portion through the heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the Generous, the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Praise be unto God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Nevertheless the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the men of the House of Justice that they may enforce them according to the exigencies of the time and the dictates of wisdom. Once again We exhort all believers to observe justice and fairness and to show love and contentment. They are indeed the people of Baha, the companions of the Crimson Ark. Upon them be the peace of God, the Lord of all Names, the Creator of the heavens.\n\n=== END BH00053 ===\n\n=== START BH00054 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Manifest, the Most High, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise be to God Who hath revealed the Face after the passing away of all things, and hath stirred the Kingdom of Names through the movement of His Most Exalted Pen, and hath spoken that whereby the essence of evanescence hath been invested with the robe of everlasting existence. Glorified be He Whom the hearts of the possessors of understanding cannot comprehend, nor can that which ascendeth from the realm of creation reach unto Him. He it is Who hath quickened the bones through the breezes of His Most Sublime Word, whereby was raised the pavilion of 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth.' Verily, He is the Lord of the throne and of the earth, the Sovereign of the Hereafter and of the former times. Blessed is the one who hath hearkened unto His sweetest call, and blessed the strong one whom the veils of names have not weakened. Exalted is our Lord above the mention of every mentioner and the description of every describer. All things have testified to His loftiness and power, His sublimity and grandeur. The comprehension of the mystics cannot grasp Him, nor can the knowledge of the learned know Him. He hath created all things by His command and sovereignty, and hath ordained for every matter an appointed time in His Book. Verily, He is the Single One, the One, the Self-Subsisting, before Whom all necks have bowed in humility. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nI pray, glorify, magnify and offer salutations upon those whom the wine of mystic knowledge hath intoxicated in the days of the All-Merciful, in such wise that they have spoken with wisdom and utterance amongst the concourse of creation. These are servants whom heedlessness hath not overtaken and whose necks have not bent with drowsiness. They have arisen to serve the Lord of mankind in such manner as hath bewildered the minds of the wise and the hearts of the eloquent. The servant beseecheth his Lord through the tongues of all created things that He may gather him beneath their shadow and grant him a station in their proximity. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and from Whose will nothing in creation, past or future, can hinder Him. He, verily, is the Single, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nMy spirit be a sacrifice for your mention. Your letter hath reached me and caused me to hear the warbling of the bird of divine knowledge, and guided me to the pathway of my Sovereign and your Sovereign and the Sovereign of all in creation. By the life of the Beloved! Such longing hath seized me as cannot be contained in pages. To this doth testify the Lord of the Covenant, through Whom the horizons have been illumined. Then did the magnet of Glory attract me and bring me into the precincts of holiness, nearness and beauty. When I appeared before the Face, I presented what was in the letter concerning your submissiveness, humility and supplication unto God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. When this was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply, saying - and His sweetest utterance is this:\n\nO Jamal! Were one to observe carefully, We have concealed and dispatched volumes of utterance in but a single word. Now consider how many verses have been revealed and sent in your name. Reflect, that thou mayest recognize God's grace and bounty, God's mercy and generosity. Every fair-minded one hath testified and doth testify to the greatness of the ocean of divine grace, and in all conditions the glance of favor and the eye of loving-kindness have been directed and turned toward you. Be assured of what thy Lord, the All-Knowing, imparteth unto thee. Today you must be focused on matters that cause the exaltation of God's Cause. Naught is seen today save the sovereignty and authority of God. Verily, We have sent unto thee the Sealed Wine, the Water of Life, and the Salsabil of divine knowledge. To this thy Lord, the All-Merciful, doth testify from this glorious horizon.\n\nYou wrote that you had met with S from the people of S and intended to invite him again. It is known that His Holiness has always dealt with the servants of God with the utmost kindness, love and compassion. God willing, may the breezes of these days take hold of that person and enable him to achieve supreme steadfastness and service to the twin Luminous Lights. This matter was presented at the Most Holy Court and was accepted. He said: \"Let him associate with the servants with spirit and fragrance and guide them to the path of God, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great.\"\n\nRegarding what you wrote about turning toward the land of S, He said these days it is not advisable, for \"the wolf howls and the frog croaks. Be patient until the fragrance of acceptance and assurance wafts from there.\"\n\nNow that three hours have passed on Sunday the 27th of Dhi'l-Qa'dah, this evanescent servant has been blessed with another letter from His Holiness, and the breezes of His favors have taken hold of and surrounded this servant. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may ever keep that Beloved one warbling, explaining and speaking in the gardens of utterance. In all cases this servant is ashamed and abashed before the divine friends and hopes for forgiveness.\n\nYou had written appointing this servant as your representative for visiting the Ancient Beauty at the appointed time. When I attained the Most Holy Court and was honored with circumambulation and visitation on your behalf, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke saying: \"O My Name 'Beauty'! The servant in attendance has visited on your behalf and We have accepted it as a favor from Us that you may rejoice and be thankful.\" Then on your behalf I also attained the blessing of visiting the Branches of God and those who circle round.\n\nYou wrote that on behalf of this evanescent servant along with the divine friends Aqa Muhammad-Taqi and Aqa Shir-'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God, you attained the visitation of the Most Great Holy Leaf, His sister - may my spirit and the spirits of all the worlds be a sacrifice for her holy resting place. This was the perfection of kindness regarding this evanescent one. Mention of the two souls who were honored to serve His Holiness was made at the Most Holy Court. The Sun of favor has dawned in relation to each one. God willing, may they attain supreme steadfastness and remain protected from the fetid winds of the souls of the polytheists. O beloved of my heart, observe what a day this is, while people are content with falsehood in their discourse and have turned away from the Lord of Causes and Sovereign of nations. Such is the station of imaginary temples. Fie upon them and their fidelity! They have broken God's Covenant and His pact and have disputed His verses after their revelation. I testify that they are among the most lost in the Clear Book.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the holy tomb and its state of disrepair, this was presented and He said: \"This is God's way with His loved ones from before. Blessed is he who repairs and raises it. However, wisdom must be observed in all conditions. O Beauty, wisdom appears like the morning star from the horizon of the divine Book's heaven. Its observance is necessary and obligatory for all.\"\n\nYou testified with all your limbs and members that all glory, bounty, rest and joy lie in His shadow and in His love, and praise be to God that I have attained to both. After presenting this passage, He said: \"He hath spoken the truth,\" and God willing these words shall ever flow from his pen and tongue in such wise that no trace of vexation or sorrow shall follow. O Beauty! Rejoice in My remembrance of thee and My favors unto thee. Let nothing sadden thee in God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nConcerning the funds you wrote about, stating that you had delivered them as instructed to the specified individuals and had sent the receipts - the receipts arrived, and this servant praises the Beloved of the world for having aided you to serve the Cause. Verily, He is the Helper of those who act.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about H.S. (upon him be the Glory of God) - in truth this servant has been remiss in serving him, but it was due to Mulla Muhammad-'Ali, as I thought he would return and I would send the reply to his letter with him. In any case, this matter was delayed until these days when the aforementioned one decided to depart, and this servant wrote a detailed letter to him and likewise several separate Tablets were prepared that should reach him. God willing they will arrive. If you meet him, express on behalf of this non-existent one, this absolute void, mention of evanescence and nothingness.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the friends in the land of Kh., stating that you had sent a copy of the Blessed Tablet and that you constantly make mention of divine favors concerning them - this matter is most pleasing. In these days two petitions arrived from them, and the reply to one was bestowed and sent, and other petitions have also arrived. God willing, may they ever be blessed with the grace of the All-Merciful. Once the Ancient Tongue spoke these blessed words: \"O servant in attendance! Write to His Beauty that in all conditions thou shouldst gaze toward the horizon of unity in such wise that differences move thee not. Unity is the greatest foundation for the edifices of the City of Knowledge. Look not at the people and their deeds and what they speak and utter. Behold what hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's utterance and take hold of it through My Name, the Strong, the Self-Subsisting. If abasement befall thee in this path, it is the very essence of glory. Be wholly for God, then rejoice in His bounty unto thee and be of the thankful ones. And if someone behaves contrary to divine laws and ordinances, remind him with utmost love in such manner that it causes him no embarrassment. If he accepts, he hath attained unto counsel, and if not, then ask God to guide him to His straight path.\"\n\nWhen this utterance was heard from the Dawning-Place of the All-Merciful's revelation, in truth the attraction of divine favor so seized this servant that the pen confesses its inability to describe it. God willing may all servants attain unto the sweetness of the All-Merciful's utterance. By the life of the Intended One! Should they attain unto the sweetness of but one word, they would not exchange the Sun of Truth for all that exists in creation and all that is mentioned therein, and all would proceed toward the ultimate goal.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the sanctuary of the Name of God - upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory of God - it was submitted and He said: \"Yes, what was done was for God.\" From time to time, with wisdom, inquire about their circumstances. These matters are most beloved, provided they are carried out with wisdom, for if the hosts of the Wolf and the parties of the serpent, and some from within and without become aware, it will not be free from harm. Take wisdom as a command from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-Rida and Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib - upon them be the Glory of God - two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will and sent with Ibn-i-Asdaq - upon him be the Glory of God. After this detail was submitted before the Throne, He said: The gaze of favor is upon them. God willing, they must arise to serve the Cause with such enthusiasm that its effect shall remain permanent and enduring. Convey My glory, O Jamal, to them both on My behalf, and remind them of My remembrance, My favor, My grace, and My mercy which have encompassed both the sovereign and the subject. Verily We have remembered them and turned toward them from this Forbidden Place, and We counsel them to show forth the greatest steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of all beings, in such wise that neither the knowledge of the knowers, nor the wisdom of the wise, nor the learning of the learned, nor the hosts and multitudes shall prevent them. God willing, may they guide mankind and summon the people to the truth. May they protect weak hearts and minds from the doubts and imaginings of the deluded ones, through the Name of God. Verily, We send Our glory from this Station and convey Our greetings upon them and upon those who have turned with illumined hearts therein unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nAnother submission is that His Honor Aqa Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote a letter to this servant requesting some wondrous and exalted Tablets for certain people of Dawlatabad and those regions. After presenting this to the Most Holy Court, that very night blessed Tablets descended from the heaven of the Lord's Will. Some were written by the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His most pure footsteps - and some were written by this servant as commanded, since in this year when the Branch of God would sometimes honor different regions with His presence, this servant would copy some Tablets from the revealed text and send them as commanded. In any case, the Tablets for the aforementioned Mirza will be sent either this time or next. However, He stated that all people have not known and do not know the value of the divine Tablet and are incapable of comprehending its outer meaning, let alone its inner meaning. And verses, proofs and Tablets have been revealed, made manifest and sent to such a degree that counting them would be most difficult. Now some Arabic and Persian Tablets that transcend suppositions and imaginings should be collected. Among them, the servant in attendance's letters that are adorned with the ornament of the All-Merciful's utterance are very useful, as divine verses and utterances of every kind have been revealed in them. These should be collected and given, as circumstances warrant, to several souls who possess the power of utterance and are adorned with pleasing character and lofty attributes, that they may turn to different regions, perchance to guide people to the supreme horizon and give them to drink of the water of immortality. Today teachers are needed and expounders are necessary. Every soul should have the verses of the All-Merciful before his eyes in every station and convey them in their proper place. Thus doth the Truth teach you and I am the All-Knowing.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the ascension of Fathu'llah, utterances were revealed and made manifest from the heaven of grace. And since his brother had been waiting a long time and had sent several letters to this evanescent servant with no opportunity for reply, therefore this time a letter was written to him mentioning the elevated one. Blessed is he and blessed is he who attains to the mention of God in His days.\n\nFurthermore, in these days a letter arrived from Hadba and among it was seen the petition that Manakji Sahib had submitted to the Most Holy Court. This letter had remained en route and in Hadba for some time. After presenting it to the Most Holy Court, He commanded to write to Jamal to mention to them:\n\nThe letter of that friend arrived. We beseech the Lord of the world to gladden and refresh him with the remembrance of the Friend and to bestow upon him from His bounties that which is befitting. His mention has been in the gathering of friends and with the help of the Peerless Friend it shall continue to be. Convey Our greetings and salutations.\n\nO beloved of my heart! At most times this servant hears the lamentation of his own heart, for he observes that the lights of the Sun of Truth have encompassed the world, and yet the people remain heedless and veiled. What do the people of the Furqan possess, and what have the people of the Bayan, and to what do other peoples cling, and by what proof do they hold fast? All that hath come to pass in the world, both general and specific, hath been explicitly revealed in the divine Books in but a few years, one after another, as that being and every fair-minded soul would testify. The Surih of Ra'is by itself, and the Tablet of the Temple, and other Tablets are extant and available. Blessed is he who, being endowed with insight, acknowledgeth what he hath heard and seen. After mention was made of the sovereign of Paris and the chief of that great city, some were bewildered, and even certain of the loved ones would say to this servant how it could be that the emperor of the world would be abased and find himself humiliated and defeated, when all the kings moved and acted by his command and will. Apart from these things, behold the other afflictions that have overtaken the world. Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan, through mere fabrications, have deprived themselves of the ocean of fairness and knowledge. By the life of God! They are indeed in manifest loss.\n\nYou have undoubtedly heard the details of what transpired in Adrianople, when Siyyid Muhammad, being confident that the Ancient Beauty would not confront one such as Yahya, told Mir Muhammad - who was one of the simple-minded followers - and likewise to some of the Persians of that land, that on the morrow so-and-so would come forth. If they spoke the truth, let them also come forth and meet at the Sultan Selim Mosque, that truth might be distinguished from falsehood. The next day, Mir Muhammad - upon him be the glory of God - came and conveyed this message to the Most Holy Court. At that moment, the Ancient Beauty arose and went forth from the gate of the private quarters, revealing divine verses in the most exalted voice as He proceeded, until He arrived at the mosque. Some Persians were present, listening in utter amazement, with tears streaming down their faces. He told Mir Muhammad: \"Go and tell them to appear.\" After some time he returned and reported that the Chief of Liars had asked to be excused. The Ancient Beauty granted a further two days' respite. This incident occurred in the presence of seventy believers and others. Nevertheless, after arrival in the Most Great Prison, one day a well-known person came into the presence of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His most mighty footsteps - and reported that Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Jan were claiming that in Adrianople it had been arranged for the Ancient Beauty to meet with him in one assembly for discourse, but while Mirza Yahya came, the Ancient Beauty did not appear, and this became evident to all the divines, notables and the governor. The Branch of God presented this before the Divine Throne, saying: \"Such astonishment seized me that I was rendered incapable of response.\" Now observe how they have recounted and distorted such a clear and evident matter. They have attributed to themselves all the characteristics of the Ancient Beauty, and ascribed their own misdeeds to the Manifestation of sanctity and holiness. Throughout the years of their stay in Adrianople, they were occupied day and night with such activities. Thus whatever was manifested from the Most Great Branch in His childhood, Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani would attribute to Ahmad, son of Yahya, and mention it in his name. The curse of God be upon the liars and the slanderers!\n\nIn the beginning when the Ancient Beauty disassociated from him, the matter concerned that faithless one's violation of the sanctity of the Primal Point's - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - household. After some time, when this proved unacceptable to the heedless ones, he gave it to another vile person. By God, besides Whom there is no other God, this servant is ashamed of his deeds and actions. And you yourself know that no one besides this servant is aware, as I was with him. God suffices as witness to what I say. He committed acts that neither tongue can utter nor pen can record. You have surely heard some of them. He imagines he is following the laws of the Primal Point. Ask him by what religious decree he has taken these multiple wives in various cities. It behooveth us to cease mention of such as these and to speak of that which befitteth the days of God, the Lord of all worlds. The One God is witness that this servant never intended and does not intend to make such mentions, and for several years his mention was completely set aside. However, in these days, as he has become occupied with various calumnies, therefore these few matters, which in truth are but a drop from the ocean of his deeds, were submitted for God's sake so that the friends of God might be informed. You who are aware of much, God willing, should ensure all the friends become informed lest they be deprived of the lights of the Sun of Revelation due to the darkness of false souls. Although powerful souls who have drunk from the Most Great Ocean see the world as non-existent, how much more so these thorns and thistles of the sea and lumps of clay of the land. He has said the guardians of the Divine City must be vigilant and aware. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak aforetime - verily He is the All-Informing, the All-Knowing. \\[...\\]\n\nHe is the Dawning-Place from the Horizon of Utterance!\n\nGod willing, thou shalt partake of the sweet fragrances of the divine days and receive thy portion from the ocean of the All-Merciful's mercy. This is the Day that hath been mentioned and recorded in all the divine Books and Scriptures, past and future. Today is the day of seeing, for the Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation and the Dayspring of God's Command declareth \"Look and thou shalt behold Me.\" And today is the day of hearing, for from all directions the call of the Revealer of Verses is raised. The Mother Book hath been sent down, yet the people are occupied with trifling diversions. The Revealer of Verses hath appeared, yet the servants are engaged in idle play. Lift up thy head and gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon, that thou mayest witness the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. Strive, that this evanescent world may not withhold thee from thy eternal station. Though speech is formed of words, this utterance is sanctified above words, for it hath appeared from the wellspring of divine knowledge. Reflect, that thou mayest discover that which is hidden from thee. By My life! Today is not the day for reflection \\[but\\] today is the day for striving. The heedless have forsaken the Most Great Ocean and turned to a mirage. They have mistaken darkness for light and counted the ignorant as learned. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, that thou mayest be recorded among the successful ones in God's Book. Say:\n\nO my God! I beseech Thee not to withhold me from the ocean of Thy knowledge, the sun of Thy grace, and the heaven of Thy bounty. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd concerning Aqa Siyyid Aqa-Jan, this Most Holy Tablet was revealed:\n\nHe is the Mighty, the All-Praised!\n\nThis is a remembrance unto him who hath turned toward the ocean of My utterance and desired to drink therefrom in My Name, the Forgiving, the Generous. O servant! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison and summoneth thee unto God, the Mighty, the Wise. Abandon the world and all that is therein, and hold fast unto the cord of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Beware lest thou be saddened by the intimations of those who have disbelieved in God, disputed His signs, turned away from His sovereignty, and clung to the images and idols they possess. Their divines have withheld them from the Known One Who hath come in His name, the Self-Subsisting, with an authority before which every discerning one hath bowed down. They have turned away from certitude by following vain imaginings. Thus doth the Book Gracious recount unto thee. Say:\n\nGlorified art Thou, O God of existence! I testify that Thou hast manifested the Manifestation of Thyself, the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, and the Dayspring of Thy signs, and through Him Thou hast guided Thy servants to the ocean of Thy knowledge. Among them are those who turned away, those who turned toward Thee, and those who pronounced sentence to shed the blood of Thy chosen ones and loved ones. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast illumined hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge, to ordain from Thy Most Exalted Pen for the people of Baha that which shall sanctify them from all else but Thee, draw them nigh unto Thee, and strengthen them in such wise that they may behold Thy signs as they are in themselves, not as they desire to see them. O Lord! I am the poor one who hath turned toward the horizon of Thy riches. I beseech Thee to assist me in that which beseemeth Thy days. Then ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of both the beginning and the end. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nAnd concerning the people of Bahnimir and one of the handmaidens of God who was mentioned in his letter, these wondrous and sublime verses were revealed:\n\nHe is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed \\[...\\]\n\nGlorified be He Who hath appeared with the truth and manifested what He desired through His command \"Be, and it is!\" He is, verily, the One through Whom the Balance was revealed and the Tongue spoke. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He hath arisen in His name, the Self-Subsisting, among the servants and hath spoken that which caused agitation among the dwellers of the cities of names, save whom God, the Lord of existence, hath willed. O people of Bahnimir! The All-Informed calleth you and mentioneth you in connection with how the breath of the All-Merciful hath wafted over all possibility, and praiseth those who have sacrificed their souls in the path of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Blessed is the blood that was shed in the path of God and blessed is the body that bore hardships in His love. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation mentioned those servants who hastened to the field of sacrifice in such wise as to astonish all hearts. We magnify every living one who hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and pray for every martyr who hath laid down his life in His manifest and evident path. We make mention of Our maidservant who hath attained unto My days and turned unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee. We have made mention of thee out of Our grace, and of Our loved ones in that place. Blessed art thou and they, and those who have attained unto the recognition of God, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nAs for the names mentioned in your letters, whether of the living or the dead, divine Tablets have been revealed specifically for each one. Verily, mention is an adornment for the servants in their lives and an ocean of forgiveness after their death. According to instructions, this servant wrote and sent the revealed Tablets, as the Most Great Branch was not present. It would be preferable if a clear copy were written and sent with the Tablets, as some may not be able to read them properly.\n\nFurthermore, your latest letter dated the 18th of Ramadan arrived. It dispelled sorrow, destroyed grief, eliminated sadness, and what it conveyed is clear and evident, requiring no elaboration. After it was presented before the Most Holy Presence, He said: \"O Jamal, thou didst make a covenant that henceforth naught but words of contentment and signs of joy and gladness would reach the Most Holy Court from thee. God willing, through the favors of the Beloved of the world, thou wilt remain faithful to this covenant. Although the Supreme Pen hath testified concerning thee that thou hast been faithful to God's Covenant and hast arisen to serve His Cause, yet this first matter hath been mentioned in several letters thou hast sent to this servant in attendance. God willing, it must be fulfilled. Drink, in My Name, from the ocean of My joy and gladness and say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\"\n\nO Jamal! We have heard thy call in thy latest letter which thou didst send to Our servant, and We have answered thee in the morning and in the evening and at noontide, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. And concerning what thou didst mention in thy Persian supplication: \"O God! Thou Thyself art witness that whenever I hear Thy lamentations in the Tablets bewailing the differences among Thy servants, I am so overwhelmed that I am nearly driven to flee to the mountains, beating my head, and to hide my face in shame, never to show it again\" - and this continues until where thou sayest that from the verses of a Tablet revealed to one of the loved ones, thou hadst understood that complaints about thee had been made at the Most Holy Court. This servant declareth that no such matter hath ever been mentioned in the revealed Tablets. God Himself is witness that thou hast been regarded with favor and hast been the object of grace. And after this matter was presented at the Most Holy Court, they stated: \"Much favor hath been shown to thee. Know thou the value of thy Lord's grace and be of the thankful ones.\" Were this the time of the Herald's Manifestation, many villages would have been bestowed upon thee. Know thou this much: that one who hath been blessed by God's grace and whom He hath named with the Name of God - that is, who hath been honored with the address \"O My Name\" - verily if such a one should, for the sake of God and His Cause and the exaltation of His Word, humble himself before the lowliest soul, no harm shall come to him; nay rather, it shall cause his glory and exaltation. Thus doth thy Lord remind thee. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Enter thou the vast expanse of hope and step into the arena of detachment. Verily, He will not suffer to be lost the reward of thine actions and what thou hast wrought in His path. He hath, indeed, exalted thee through His grace, and He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nRegarding what thou didst write about the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and the Blessed Spot, it was submitted, and He said: \"The matter of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar hath been revealed in the Most Holy Book, but today all matters are contingent upon wisdom. In any land where it is deemed advisable and not contrary to wisdom, there is no objection. This is what God ordained aforetime and at this moment.\"\n\nToday, the observation of wisdom is necessary and obligatory for everyone.\n\nAnd concerning thy request for forgiveness for thy relatives, this is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: \"O Jamal! We have forgiven them and absolved them of their misdeeds, and illumined them with the light of Our countenance in the Supreme Horizon, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Lord of all beings, Who hath answered thee in that which thou didst beseech Him and hath given thee to drink from the ocean of reunion. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\" The souls mentioned have all attained unto divine mercy and been adorned with the robe of forgiveness. Blessed is every servant and maidservant who hath been remembered by God after their ascension unto Him.\n\nConcerning what thou didst write about Haji ?adiq from the people of Kha, it was presented at the Most Holy Court, and He said: \"We send Our greetings to him and command him to observe what hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is he for having recognized and attained unto this Cause, whereby the mountains have trembled and all who are in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Strong, the Mighty. Say: O ?adiq! Be steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. Verily, this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. And when a cawing one cometh unto you with a book, know ye that it is assuredly the book of the wicked ones, recorded in a clear tablet. O people of freedom! Hold fast unto the cord of God and cast behind you every suspicious cawing one.\"\n\nO My loved ones of the letter Kha! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of you from this exalted Station and counseleth you concerning the Book of God which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord. Take ye hold of the Book of Certitude and cast behind you the vain imaginings of those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nO Jamal! We have made mention of those from among the people of Kha whose names were recorded in thy book. Give them the glad-tidings of this great bounty. God willing, all must arise with supreme steadfastness to promote the Cause of the Lord of Names and remain so firm in the Cause that all the peoples of the world shall be powerless to hinder them. Say: Beware lest the buzzing of the fly debar you from God, the Lord of all men. The evil ones of the earth seek to lead the servants astray in the name of truth. Guard yourselves through the name of your Lord, the Strong, the Mighty.\n\nAt all times fix your gaze upon the horizon of the All-Merciful and drink from the living waters of inner meanings and utterance which flow from the Fountainhead of words. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto this Day and hath quaffed the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of his Gracious Lord. The souls who have accepted the Faith must be vigilant and remain seated upon the throne of steadfastness. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed aforetime in the Qur'an: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\" \"Nay! Truly the record of the wicked is in Sijjin. And what shall teach thee what Sijjin is? It is a written record. Woe on that day unto those who deny!\" Consider and reflect that ye may drink from the ocean of meanings that lie hidden within this blessed verse and attain unto such a station wherein the books of the world shall not prevent you from the Mother Book, and the whisperings of the Evil One shall not keep you back from the Lord of mankind. How many are the evil ones who, through displays of piety and devotion, have led the servants astray and debarred them from the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Thus have We adorned the sea of knowledge with the ship of utterance. Blessed is every steadfast hearer.\n\nThis most holy, most exalted, most sanctified Tablet was revealed specifically for the people of Turbat and Furugh and their surroundings, whose names were recorded in your book, and likewise specifically for the people of Kha who have believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. God willing, may all attain unto it and act according to it.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about the Huququ'llah, He hath commanded that its payment is binding upon all. And regarding what you wrote that Haji ?adiq, upon him be the Glory of God, submitted the Huququ'llah from the properties themselves - in these days they wrote asking what should be done, whether to sell or to send the yearly proceeds - this matter was presented, and this is what was revealed in response: We have given permission to the aforementioned Haji to act according to whichever he chooseth. The purpose is that the deed be accomplished with joy and fragrance. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He shall not be asked of His doings and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nConcerning what you wrote mentioning Aqa Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Muhammad-Quli, this was presented before the Most Holy Court. He said: God willing, may they be blessed with divine favors and be directed toward the horizon of their goal. Their purpose is known and evident, but the strangers have come between us and the faithful ones. Although patience in separation from the Beloved is most bitter, yet since it is by His command it is most dear. The Primal Point hath said that the whole world exists that men might attain unto the word of resignation from His presence. Now the Supreme Pen declareth \\[...\\]\n\nO Muhammad! O thou who gazest toward My horizon! Be patient in thy separation from thy Lord and say: O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for them that have turned unto Thee and have attained unto Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful.\n\nO Muhammad-Quli! Hearken unto My call and be of them that are thankful. Say: O my Lord! I have longed for the Kawthar of Thy presence and the ocean of Thy reunion. I beseech Thee by Thy grace not to disappoint me, and to ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAs to what thou didst write concerning his honor Aqa Mirza Kazim, son of the martyr, upon him be the Glory of God, he and his family have been the recipients of Our favor, and this servant had previously sent a letter in response to his missive, adorned and embellished with divine verses. God's favors toward him have shone forth like the manifest sun. God willing, may he be occupied at all times with the mention and praise of the Beloved of all horizons. We have assuredly made mention of him before, and before that, and We mention him now with fragrant joy that he may give thanks to his Lord, the All-Merciful, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. Mention of him hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen. Give him the glad-tidings of this bounty and make mention of him with this wondrous remembrance. God willing, may he ever remain the recipient of this favor.\n\nAnother entreaty is that if you meet with Jinab-i-Ismu'llah-i-Jud, upon him be all the Glory of the All-Glorious, mention on behalf of this evanescent one the mention of extinction and nothingness, and say: \"O my Beloved! A mighty day and a mighty Cause have come. Can any eye be found in the world that, detached from all veils and clouds and from all conjectures and idle fancies and from all that hath been heard, can behold the signs of God in themselves, or any ear that can hearken unto the Call purely for the sake of God?\" The servants are small and the Cause is great, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. What hath befallen these heedless people that they remain veiled and, through the buzzing of flies, are deprived of the Lord of all return? It behooveth every soul to regard the divine Cause as it is in itself, not as they desire it to be. In truth, the greatest terror hath encompassed mankind. Apart from all else, observe the people of the Bayan, what vain imaginings they have clung to, after what the Primal Point hath spoken concerning this Most Great, Most Exalted Manifestation: \"Beware, beware on the day of His manifestation lest thou be veiled by the Vahid of the Bayan, for that Vahid is but a creature before Him, and beware, beware lest thou be veiled by the words that were revealed in the Bayan, for they are but His own words in the temple of His previous manifestation.\" Nevertheless, what they have said and continue to say! They lay claim to the verses, which are but as dust itself. They are drowned in the suspicions of the People of the Furqan. Say: O ye who are as paupers! For twelve hundred years the People of the Furqan were reared in these suspicions and idle fancies and counted themselves the most excellent of all peoples and the most virtuous of all that dwell on earth. Yet what excellence did they achieve and what station did they attain? Say: Shatter the idols of names through the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious. This is better for you, did ye but know it. Perchance they may rend asunder the veils and soar, unfettered and free, in this holy and spiritual atmosphere. By His very truth, they were afflicted with a hundred thousand ailments, yet were conscious of not even one. And now these people are following in those same footsteps and are warring against the Lord of all being with the weapons of falsehood and calumny. What use is it that people are unaware of the truth of the Cause? Every soul who was acquainted with all matters - how they denied Him night and day, and what calumnies they uttered against Him lest He become trusted and a source of confidence for the servants. In any case, arise and speak, that perchance the lights of the Sun of Truth may encompass the world and the realm of fancy may be transformed from potentiality to actuality. We beseech God not to deprive any of His servants, whether of the East or of the West, of this mighty bounty and this great gift. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer. Some time ago, a wondrous and glorious Tablet was revealed from the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence specifically for them and was sent. God willing, they have attained unto it. Likewise specifically for Jinab-i-Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to gather us in one place that I may mention to your honor what lay concealed behind the veil. He is our Protector in the beginning and in the end. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.\n\nAnother entreaty is that thou shouldst convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings to all the friends of God and say: The Day is come and mankind hath arisen unto the Lord of the worlds. This station requireth steadfastness. Blessed is he who hath taken its chalice and drunk therefrom in the name of his Lord, the All-Wise. God willing, may they attain such a station wherein neither the buzzing of the fly nor the croaking of the raven shall debar them from the Lord of Return. They must walk and speak with the utmost wisdom, and at times gather together with perfect wisdom and recite the verses of God in Persian and Arabic, and ponder upon them. By the life of the Beloved! The breezes of the verses will so attract them that they shall behold themselves as mountains firm in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have testified to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAgain I submit that thou didst write that in these days differences have, by God's grace, been removed and unity hath been achieved. These words brought boundless joy. May it ever be thus! Signs of delight were evident and manifest in the Ancient Beauty regarding this matter. In truth, this mention from thee is a great glad-tiding for the servants. God willing, may all attain the exalted station of unity and concord. I have written this much and caused such trouble that I now find myself abashed and ashamed. This sin requireth great forgiveness. Verily He is the Pardoner, the Forgiving.\n\n=== END BH00054 ===\n\n=== START BH00055 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing\n\nO spiritual youth! Upon thee be the eternal glory of God! Thy letter attained the honor of being heard in the Most Holy Presence of the Lord of all beings. Blessed art thou for having cast aside the world, turning toward the Most Great Prison, until thou didst attain the presence of the Ancient King and didst hear that for which all things were created to hear. Thou didst seek, thou didst enter, and thou didst witness that wherewith the Books of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, had given thee glad tidings. Grieve thou not over anything, but place thy trust in God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, for having aided me to attain Thy presence and to stand before the door of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the signs of Thy greatness and the standards of Thy power in Thy lands, and by Thy mercy that hath preceded all creation and Thy might that hath encompassed all existence, to make me steadfast, firm and immovable in Thy Cause, speaking Thy praise and glorification, turning in all conditions to the lights of Thy countenance, and guiding Thy servants to Thy path. O my Lord! Thou art He Whose grace hath encompassed all and Who hath manifested what was hidden in Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name and Thy Mighty Announcement to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and to make me content and thankful. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Loving.\n\nO spiritual youth! From your letter was detected the fragrance of despair. Despair not of God's spirit, neither lose hope in thy Lord's mercy, nor grieve in His days. Verily We have summoned thee, given thee glad tidings, inspired thee, taught thee and caused thee to know, that thou mayest give glad tidings to the servants concerning the manifestation of Truth and His sovereignty, His grandeur and His power. Beware lest anything prevent thee from what thou hast been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Hold fast to the Book and what hath been sent down therein from the heaven of thy Lord's will, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nThe world of the Bayan hath been transformed into the world of the Shi'ih, in its essence, its outward form, its names, its attributes, its delusions and its imaginings. Nay, its people are seen to be more remote, more debased and more ignorant. Wherever thou meetest the people of God in any city or region, convey to them the greetings from the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of the lights of the Luminary of the heaven of the grace of the World's Desired One. Convey My glorification to the people of Darakhsh and say: O My loved ones there! Hearken unto the call of God, the True King, the Manifest. Verily it hath been raised up in this Most Exalted Station, this Most High Summit and this Ultimate Goal. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nYe have been beneath the glances of your Lord's mercy. Give thanks unto God for this mighty favor. Beware lest anything among all things occupy you away from the Creator of heaven, or wealth and hopes prevent you from the Final Goal in this Day wherein the Temple of the Manifestation is established upon the Throne of Utterance and speaketh that which draweth the servants nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Ye are in your homeland while the Lord of the worlds was a captive in the hands of the heedless until they imprisoned Him in this place round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call and hath turned with his heart to the Most Sublime Horizon--the Place wherein the Wronged One was imprisoned through that which the hands of the aggressors have wrought.\n\nO people of God! Arise to assist the Cause through wisdom and utterance, through deeds and conduct. Verily He aideth whom He willeth as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Commander, the All-Knowing. By God! The ocean of knowledge hath surged in the contingent world. Take therefrom a cup in My Name, then drink thereof through My remembrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Beware lest the world prevent you from the Lord of all humanity, or colors prevent you from your Lord, the Most Merciful. Leave aside all else, turning unto Him, as bidden by His command, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Light hath shone forth from the horizon of Manifestation while the people are in evident delusion. The fragrance of the verses hath been diffused and the clear proofs have appeared. Blessed is he who hath advanced, found and attained, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nO My Light! Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. Arise to assist the Cause, and know ye that the true assistance hath ever been and shall ever be the teaching of God's Cause. Today the immortal Kawthar lieth concealed in the utterance of the people of Baha. They must, through God's grace and bounty, bestow it freely that the dwellers of the graves may be stirred by the breezes of the Revelation and arise. This is the Day that hath been mentioned in the divine Scriptures of old and of later times. The people of truth must strive to attain unto and be illumined by the light of true unity, and must likewise protect the servants of God for His sake, lest they become afflicted with vain imaginings like unto the Shi'ih sect and be deprived, on the Day of Resurrection, of the light of the utterance of the Lord of all beings. Throughout ages and centuries they took pride in what they possessed, yet on the Day of Judgment they appeared as Nimrod, nay worse and more evil. Today the trees cry out, and likewise the fruits and leaves, the stones and pits, and all things, yet there are no attentive ears. Trusting in God, occupy yourselves with quickening the dead, that perchance they may come to life and attain unto everlasting life, becoming sanctified from the doubts and idle fancies of the past and illumined with the light of the Day-Star of certitude. O My loved ones in that land! Ye have ever been and continue to be remembered. Know ye the worth and station of the divine words. We beseech God to assist you in recovering what was lost and to ordain for you that which endureth and abideth. Soon shall all that is visible vanish away and extinction shall overtake all, but that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen hath been and shall forever remain. Blessed are they that attain thereunto. We love you and glorify you and give you glad tidings of My acceptance and favor and mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Ye are of the people of light; therefore the radiance of the Day-Star of the horizons must needs be manifest and evident from you. Blessed are ye, and joy be unto you, from God, the Aim of the mystics and the Beloved of them that are nigh unto Him.\n\nO My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the people of Birjand, that the sweet fragrances of their remembrance may guide them to the highest horizon. The loved ones of that land have ever been and are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. All that hath befallen the friends of God hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen upon the Crimson Tablet. Reflect upon the power and grandeur of creation. The earth, which outwardly appeareth to be the lowliest and meanest of all things, hath been made by Him the treasury of wealth, the source of bounty, the dawning-place of mercy, and the fountainhead of generosity and benevolence. Had the dwellers of the earth heeded that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen, all would have entered the kingdom of wealth and attained unto the supreme bounty. However, the denial of divine favors and heedlessness toward the horizon of mercy have come from the divines of the age. These are they of whom the Pen of the All-Merciful hath formerly revealed: \"They have exchanged the favor of God for disbelief and led their people to the abode of perdition.\" Render thanks unto the Lord of all beings Who enabled you to turn towards Him, to know Him, and to manifest humility and submissiveness in days when the limbs of the world trembled from the fire of hatred and rancor, and the hearts of the people were agitated. That which hath befallen His loved ones is a treasure hidden with God and a preserved trust. Blessed are they who have borne tribulations in His path. Soon shall the station of each one become manifest and evident as the sun. The hand of justice hath ever been and remaineth mighty. O My loved ones! Hold fast unto goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Forgive the negligent and pray for the sinners. Beseech God to awaken the heedless. Ye are the dawning-places of glory, kindness and mercy, for the signs and attributes of God, exalted be His glory, are made manifest through those possessed of certitude and souls that are tranquil and well-pleased. Blessed is the one who retireth to his bed with a heart purified from malice, hatred, doubts, allusions, and the troubles of the world. Beseech ye God to adorn His servants with the ornament of wisdom. This Wronged One, while in the land of Ta, maintained cordial relations with its ruling Amir. Supplicate God, exalted be His glory, to aid and confirm the Amir and grant him success in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Whatsoever hath flowed from the Pen of the Wronged One hath been for God's sake. We have accepted successive tribulations and continuous calamities for the exaltation of the Word, the reformation of the world, and the unity of nations. Every fair-minded one beareth witness and every informed one testifieth to this. O My loved ones in that land! Praise ye the Lord of all beings Who hath enabled you in His days to attain unto the outpourings of His Pen, and hath caused to be sent down for you that which shall never set from the horizon of the heaven of grace, that which no veil can obscure and no cloud can prevent. By God's life! Were ye to become aware of the fruit of the utterances of the Pen, ye would all soar upon the wings of certitude and assurance, in a state of attraction and rapture, in the atmosphere of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. We beseech God not to withhold from His party His hidden and manifest bounties. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most High.\n\nO Pen of Eternity and Herald of the world! Turn thy face toward thy loved ones in Sarchah, then make mention of them with such remembrance as will set aflame their hearts and cause their souls to soar. Verily remembrance is a light by which hearts are illumined, and a fire by which the hearts of the righteous are set ablaze. Blessed is he who is illumined by this light and enlightened by the rays of this effulgence, and who is set aflame by this fire in the days of his Lord, the Master of the beginning and the end. Blessed are ye and happy are ye! My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to your turning and your devotion on a day wherein every idolatrous doubter turned away from the Countenance - they who followed their desires and committed that which caused the dwellers of Paradise and the companions of this station to lament. O My friends! The gate of bounty hath been opened before the face of all the world. Beware lest the veils of the peoples prevent you from the Most Great Name. Cast aside what the people possess, turning with your hearts unto God, the Lord of Lords. When ye have attained unto the breezes of revelation and what hath been sent down from the Pen of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Merciful, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O our God and our Desire, for having enabled us to turn unto Thy horizon, to hold fast unto Thy cord, and to cling to the hem of Thy garment. We beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy grace, and the sun of Thy loving-kindness, and the ocean of Thy bounty, to ordain for us that which will draw us nigh unto Thee in the nights and days. Then write down for us the good of this world and of the world to come, and that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are near unto Thee, who have taken the chalice of contentment from the hands of Thy bestowal and have drunk in Thy name, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\" Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken on the tenth night of the month of fasting, as a bounty unto all beings. Blessed is he who hath heard and hath said: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged throughout all regions, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Desire of them that know.\" And We make mention in this station of him who turned unto My horizon and attained unto My days and soared in My atmosphere and spoke My praise and migrated, turning unto My face, until he stood before the gate of My grandeur and appeared before My throne and heard My sweetest call and beheld My most exalted horizon, which We have adorned, both its outer and inner aspects, with his body. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon his grave the rain of His mercy and the outpourings of His grace. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Praise be unto God! In the first days he turned with sincerity; the tribulations that befell him did not prevent him from the direction of the Divine Unity. He arrived and dwelt for numbered years beneath the shade, circling round the Wronged One, and after the passing of time and the appearance of his appointed hour, he set out for the Most Exalted Horizon. The grace of God took hold of him. God hath forgiven him as a bounty from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nIn this moment the gaze of the Wronged One hath turned with loving-kindness toward Jadhba. O people of Jadhba! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and hold fast to that which beseemeth the days of God. The word that in this Most Great Revelation will save and assure mankind is this: Observe ye the heaven and its stars, and likewise the Tree and its fruits, and its appearance and manifestation and effects. This word is accounted before God as among the lord of words. Ponder ye upon this Most Great Revelation and its arising before the peoples, that perchance the light of the All-Merciful's utterance may illumine you and the fire of His love set you ablaze. Arise ye to aid the Cause of God. Kindle the dejected souls with the fire of the Tree, and quicken the dead through the cup of the All-Merciful's utterance. Count ye the days as precious and hold fast to that which beseemeth you. This Wronged One hath, throughout the nights and days, made mention of the loved ones of God and summoned them unto that which draweth them nigh unto Him. The path is clear, the balance manifest, the verses revealed, the evidences resplendent, and He Who conversed upon Sinai speaketh before all faces. Yet they denied God's favors and remained occupied with their own idle fancies. Those who deemed themselves leaders and who, from pulpits, made mention of and spoke in the name of God, were all seen to turn aside and even become polytheists at the slightest test. Would that they had been content with what hath been mentioned! The loved ones themselves are aware of the deeds of the Shi'ih divines and their followers. O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and turn from that which is with the people to that which is with God. Erelong shall the fire of rancor and hatred in the hearts of the polytheists be extinguished and pass into nothingness. Beseech ye God that He may aid you in that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. We beseech God to manifest from you that which will draw all near unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful.\n\nMy God, my God! Adorn Thy servants with the ornament of recognition and ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thy horizon. O my Lord! Thou seest them turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee by the kingdom of Thy utterance, Thy sovereignty and Thy might, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which Thou hast ordained for them who soared in the atmosphere of Thy love and offered up their souls in Thy path. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.\n\nVerily We desire to make mention of Faran and of those who have adorned their temples with the ornament of divine knowledge and have attained unto the sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Self-Subsisting, that this remembrance may draw them nigh unto My glorious station. O people of Faran! Hearken unto My most sweet call and the rustling of My Most Exalted Pen. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved. I have come for the salvation of the world and the refinement of all nations. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the Revelation and hath believed in God, the Single, the Mighty, the Loving. Beware lest the people of error prevent you from the All-Sufficient, the Most High. Cast away what they possess, turning unto God, the One, the Single, the Sovereign over what hath been and what shall be. This is a Day wherein whosoever hath turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon hath prospered and hath witnessed what God Himself hath witnessed - that there is none other God but Him, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.\n\nO people of Faran! Take what hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Sovereign of existence. We have made mention of you before and after. Blessed are they who understand. How many a strong one hath been kept back from the Water of Life, and how many a weak one hath drawn nigh and partaken thereof through My Name, the Mighty, the Beloved. The clamor hath been raised throughout all regions - this is what We foretold you aforetime, as attesteth he who possesseth a perspicuous Book.\n\nThus hath the countenance of divine knowledge been illumined and the luminary of proof hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Tablet of your Lord, the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Hearken in the Persian tongue: There hath befallen you in the path of God that which none knoweth save the Truth. Preserve your stations and enter the impregnable fortress which hath been brought into being by the Will of God. Whosoever entereth therein shall be protected from the arrows of malice and iniquity. One pure deed in this Day excelleth the deeds of centuries and ages. Hearken unto the divine counsel and hold fast unto that which is the cause of everlasting remembrance and eternal bounty. If ears be sanctified from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful's utterance, they shall hear from all things the blessed word \"The Truth is come.\" Today the hidden is manifest and the treasured evident. The unseen and the seen are gathered in one temple. Blessed is he who hath not deprived himself, who hath taken from the Hand of Bounty the Kawthar of immortality and drunk thereof.\n\nBy the Sun of utterance which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of the prison, should anyone attain unto but a drop thereof, he shall find himself exalted above all the peoples of the world. Hearken with pure ears and behold with sanctified eyes. In the nights and days the Most Exalted Pen is occupied with the remembrance of the loved ones. No fair-minded soul can deny the evidences of this Most Great Revelation, but rather would testify that the Light is manifest, the Sun is shining, the Cause is clear, the proof perfect, the evidence brilliant, the signs all-encompassing, and the clear tokens visible. Beseech ye God to aid you in serving His Cause. The greatest service is the teaching of His Cause. The teachers must occupy themselves with wisdom and utterance in this momentous matter. The conditions for teachers are sanctity, detachment, as well as trust in God and severance. Blessed is he who is adorned with the ornament of detachment in teaching the Cause of God, the Lord of creation. Blessed are those servants who, purely for the sake of God, journey through the lands for the purpose of teaching His Cause and spreading His signs. By the life of God! The earth glorieth in the footsteps of such souls. Today the servant of the divine Cause \\[...\\]\n\nBy God's life, the earth takes pride in the footsteps of these souls. Today the servant of God's Cause and the promoter of His verses is among the most exalted of creation in the Book. O people of God! Arise to assist the Cause of the All-Merciful with wisdom and utterance. This blessed word has been revealed in most tablets that perchance the \\[heedless\\] servants might hear and hold fast unto it. Verily He is the All-Knowing Expounder, there is no God but Him, the Kind, the Generous.\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones in Furugh and give them glad tidings of Our verses and Our mercy which has encompassed the seen and the unseen. O My loved ones there! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He summons you to the praiseworthy station. O people of God! Blessed are ye and joy be unto you. Ye are they who have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon when every heedless and veiled one turned away. Ye have attained unto the traces of the Pen of the Lord of all beings and have heard the call of God, the Sovereign, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have mentioned you before with verses whereby all things proclaimed: \"Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Loving.\" We counsel you to unity and to that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of existence. Glorify the name of your Lord and remind the servants of His verses and give them glad tidings of His grace. Thus doth command you He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet.\n\nWe have revealed every year for those who have ascended unto God that whereby hearts are attracted. We testify that he attained unto My days, turned unto My path, acknowledged what was revealed by My Pen and hesitated not in My firm and irrevocable Cause. He heard and responded and hastened with his heart unto God, the Lord of this blessed Day. We counsel you as We counseled Our loved ones before with deeds and goodly character. To this testifieth He with Whom is the inscribed Book.\n\nWhen the sweetness of My utterance attracteth you and the choice wine of My knowledge seizeth you, it behooveth each one of you to arise and say, turning toward My direction and the Dawning-Place of My Revelation:\n\n\"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for Thy supreme bounties and Thy gifts, O Lord of all beings! I testify to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been supreme over all creation and powerful over all things. I beseech Thee by the establishment of Thy Temple upon the Most Great Throne and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of the worlds, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the mysteries of Thy Book, to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy mercy that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and make me content with what Thou hast ordained for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen. O Lord! Thou seest me hoping for Thy grace and looking toward the horizon of Thy bounty and gifts, that Thou mayest ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come, and the reward of those who have sought Thy most exalted station and the supreme summit until they attained unto Thy presence, circled round Thy throne, heard Thy call, beheld Thy signs, and drank the Kawthar of meeting Thee from the hands of Thy grace and the Salsabil of attaining unto Thee through Thy generosity and bounty. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nAnd We make mention of My handmaidens there and give them glad tidings of My remembrance. Blessed are they who have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon when the great ones of the earth and its nobles turned away. To this beareth witness the Tablet of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nO Exalted Pen! Turn thy face toward them that have turned unto God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, and have taken the chalice of everlasting life from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, and have drunk therefrom once in My Name and again in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people of the village! The Dawning-Place of Revelation maketh mention of you in verses that cannot be equaled by all the treasures. O land of the village! Blessed art thou, inasmuch as the remembrance of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, hath been raised within thee, and there dwell in thee honored servants who have turned unto the Supreme Horizon, whom God hath described in the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and in the Furqan which the All-Merciful revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, in these words: \"They speak not until He hath spoken, and they do according to His bidding.\"\n\nHearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He hath sent down for you aforetime that whereby the gates of grace and bounty were opened unto all them that dwell in the kingdom of creation, and the river of mercy flowed amidst all creatures. To this testifieth He Who is established upon the throne of utterance in His all-praised station. We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. He is in the Supreme Companion, bearing witness and beholding. To this testifieth the Preserved Tablet through which the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful was wafted - a bounty from His presence, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Witnessed One. We have forgiven him after We purified him with the waters of mercy, for verily I am the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through My word \"Be,\" and it is.\n\nO party of God who are there! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, then aid Him through wisdom and utterance. Thus have ye been commanded aforetime and in this inscribed Tablet. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have inhaled the fragrance of My raiment and have turned with radiant faces toward My horizon and have answered when My call was raised, and have remembered Me at eventide and at dawn, and in the afternoon and at early morn.\n\nO Leaf of Paradise! Verily, the Supreme Paradise hath turned toward thee and hath mentioned thee in such wise that its fragrance shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. We have sent down for thee, both before and after, that which hath enraptured the hearts and souls. Thus hath the ocean of knowledge revealed its waves, and the Countenance of the All-Merciful that which beseemeth this promised Day. O My handmaidens who are there! Hearken unto My call. We have counseled you before and counsel you in this exalted station concerning that which beseemeth the days of God and this irrevocable Cause. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have turned toward the Supreme Horizon when every ignorant and rejected one and every deluded learned one turned away from it. Thus hath moved the Most Exalted Pen when the Wronged One was walking in this spot wherein the Herald proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. And We make mention at this time of the loved ones of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO party of God in Ba and Shin! Hearken unto the call of God, the King, the Truth, the Manifest Justice. He calleth you from the Supreme Horizon and remembereth you with that which nothing in all creation can equal, remindeth you of His signs and gladdeneth you with tidings of His mercy that hath preceded all things great and small. Blessed are ye who have attained unto recognition in the earliest days when the All-Bountiful, the Most Exalted, was established upon His mighty throne. The affairs of the world hindered you not, nor did the doubts of the people of tyranny and wickedness deter you. Ye turned towards Him, hearkened, and said: \"Here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, O Creator of Heaven! Here am I, O Thou in Whose grasp lieth the reins of all in the heavens and earth!\" Ye are they who have attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen and its bounty which hath encompassed you. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Ye have rent asunder the veils through the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and advanced when every learned one turned away and every mystic was filled with doubt. Ye are the letters of God's Book, to this beareth witness He Who came from the heaven of proof with a clear exposition. We counsel you and those who have believed to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in this Mighty Announcement. The locusts have spread throughout the regions - this is what We forewarned you of aforetime when the Cause was exalted in Zawra and in the Land of Mystery and in this noble station - the station wherein the voice of the Wronged One was raised by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought. When the appointed time came, We seized the oppressors with might from Our presence, then those around them. Verily your Lord, the Chosen One, is the Almighty, the Powerful. No command can frustrate Him, nor can the hosts and ranks of kings and sovereigns frighten Him. He hath arisen with such authority that the limbs of the polytheists have quaked. Thus have We remembered you as a bounty from Our presence. Blessed is he who hath heard; woe unto the heedless. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon you, O people of God and His friends, and upon those whom the clamor hath not kept back from God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nWe wish to make mention of My friends in Sarayan who believed in the All-Merciful when He came from the heaven of divine will with the banners of verses. Blessed are ye for having turned towards Him and heard the call of God, the Cleaver of Dawn, and for having attained unto that which was sent down in the books of old from God, the Lord of Religions. Ye heard the call and answered the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven - thus testifieth He Who came with proof and evidence. Rejoice in that the Wronged One hath remembered you in the Most Great Prison while in the hands of the wicked ones who denied His proof that hath encompassed the horizons. They cast aside their God, clinging to their desires. Lo! They are among the misguided in God's Book, the Lord of lords.\n\nO Muhammad-Tahir! Thy name hath been mentioned before the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for thee that which the treasuries of creation cannot equal. Thou hast attained unto the traces of thy Lord's Pen of loving-kindness and unto the lights of His utterance while He was in this Most Exalted Station. He is the Almighty, the Mighty, the Bestower. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf who have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hands of their Lord's bounty, the Lord of all men. Say: This is the Day of Exposition, this is the Day of Remembrance and Praise, and this is the Day whereof God's Books, the Lord of all mankind, gave glad tidings. Say: Beware lest the world's might keep you back from the Lord of Eternity, or the power of those who have denied God in the beginning and the end weaken you. When the wine of My utterance hath seized thee and My remembrance and loving-kindness have drawn thee near, say: \"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me from Thy Most Exalted Horizon and for having turned toward me when I was in the hands of the enemies. I beseech Thee by the Lamp of Thy Cause, which Thou hast preserved from the tempests of oppression and tyranny, to strengthen me in all conditions and make me firmly attached, holding fast and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all who are in earth and heaven.\"\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! Knowest thou who maketh mention of thee? He Who remembereth thee is the Lord of the world in the Most Great Prison. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names, for having turned toward Thy servant and remembered him in such wise that the fragrance thereof shall endure throughout all ages and centuries. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which is with Thee, and to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee, O my Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted!\"\n\nO My Pen! Hearken unto My call. We have desired to make mention of the friends of the All-Merciful and His loved ones in Kaf and Shin, that they may rejoice in the loving-kindness of their Lord in their final abode. We have mentioned you before, time and again, and this is yet another time, as a token of grace from Me, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord, and He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Muhammad! Thy name hath been mentioned at this hour. We have revealed unto thee that which the pens are powerless to describe. Remember what We revealed unto thee before, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Sender of the winds. Thus hath the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the highest branches. Convey My glorification unto My loved ones and remind them of that which hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of My will. Thus have We commanded thee before and at this hour when the Ancient Beauty speaketh before the faces of all people.\n\nWe have desired to make mention at this hour of My friends and loved ones in Ba and Dal, and to remind them of that which was revealed before and after, and to give them the glad-tidings of the grace that hath encompassed all regions. Ye are they who have attained unto My call and have hearkened unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My will. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book. We withheld the Pen for a time, as a wisdom from Us and a mercy from Our presence, and I am the Powerful, the All-Choosing. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He desireth. None may object to Him. To this doth the Tongue of Grandeur bear witness from this most exalted station which God hath made the most sublime of stations. Be not grieved at anything. Aid your Lord through wisdom and utterance, and through that which hath been revealed in the Books, Scriptures and Tablets. We have mentioned each one of you in the Crimson Book by My Most Exalted Pen. Rejoice in this bounty before which, when it appeared, the lights fell prostrate. We give you once again the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy. Verily, your Lord is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed are ye for having believed on a Day whereon every ignorant doubter disbelieved. And when ye heard My call which was raised in My Tablet and attained unto the fragrances of My verses, turn your faces toward My horizon and say: \"Thine is the glory, O Lord of all names, and Thine is the praise, O Creator of the heavens! We testify to Thy power and might, Thy majesty and sovereignty, to Thy oneness which is sanctified from any likeness, and to the manifestation of Thy Cause which is purified from all peers. We beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the lights of Thy countenance and Thy hidden power treasured in the repositories of Thy protection, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued Thy cities and Thy domains, to make us among those whom the might of every oppressive tyrant hath not frightened, whom the conditions of the ungodly have not weakened, nor the power of any idolatrous infidel. O Lord! Thou hast revealed that which shall profit us in all the worlds of Thy worlds and preserve us from the barking of every barker and the clamor of those who have denied Thy right and broken Thy covenant and disputed Thy signs when Thou didst come from the horizon of eternity with proof and evidence.\" The glory from Us be upon you, O My friends, and upon My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Subduer of the winds.\n\nO concourse of lovers in Ishqabad! The Luminary of the horizons speaks on this Day of the Covenant and reminds you of that which draws you near unto God, the One Who causes the rivers to flow. You have attained unto the days of God and the recognition of the Dawning-Place of His signs, the Dayspring of His Revelations, the Treasury of His knowledge and the Source of His commandments and laws. We beseech God to aid and assist you. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling. Blessed is he who has drunk the wine of everlasting life from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.\n\nTake heed lest anything cause you to grieve. Place the world beneath your feet, turning unto God, the Illuminator of all regions. Thus has been raised the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha and the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who has heard, and woe unto every heedless imposter.\n\nO Verdant Land! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names. He makes mention of thee in such wise as nothing in all creation can equal. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this supreme bounty. O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who accepted tribulation for the exaltation of God's Cause, the Lord of all worlds. He was imprisoned in Tihran, and from thence was banished to Baghdad, and from there to the Great City, and from there to the Land of Mystery, and from there to 'Akka--the spot round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise, and then those whom the hosts of the world failed to deter from turning towards the straight Path of God. Verily, the Path speaks and calls all to the One, the All-Informed.\n\nO My loved ones in that land! You have ever been beneath the glance of your Lord's tender mercy, the All-Bountiful. He sees you and hears what your tongues utter. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We counsel you to unity, through which the horizons are illumined. He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take hold of the Book of God with the strength that comes from Him, then act in accordance with that which you have been commanded by the Mighty, the Great One.\n\nO Kazim! We have made mention of thee in numerous Tablets and have sent down for thee that which summons the servants unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Be thou vocal in My remembrance and steadfast in the service of My Cause. This is what behooveth thee in this glorious and wondrous Day. The irrevocable decree hath come from God, the Lord of eternity. He commands thee and those who have believed to unity and concord. He is the Commander, the All-Wise. Grieve not over anything. He is with thee and with those who have believed in this momentous News. Convey My glorification to the faces of My loved ones, then recite unto them what hath been sent down from My Kingdom, that the verses of thy Lord may attract them and draw them nigh unto a station wherein all things proclaim: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nO people of God! Rejoice in My call, My remembrance and My turning towards you from this remote spot. Read ye the verses of God with joy and fragrance, then help your Lord through deeds and goodly character. This is what ye have been commanded by the One Who is powerful and ancient. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you and upon everyone who is steadfast and firm.\n\nO My Supreme Pen! We have desired to conclude Our words with mention of the Mim and the Shin, and make mention of Our loved ones there who have turned with radiant faces and have quaffed the choice wine of certitude from the hands of bounty. They are assuredly among the triumphant. O people of God! Hear My call. He hath come with the truth for the salvation of mankind, yet the people remain behind an evident veil. They hear the buzzing but hear not the call of God, the True King, the Manifest Justice. They drink brackish water, turning away from the River of Mercy. Thus have their souls enticed them - they are indeed among the bewildered ones. They cling to vain imaginings, turning away from that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of certitude.\n\nO My loved ones! We have mentioned you before, time and again, in such wise as testifieth to My grace, My care, and My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Ye are they who have attained unto the traces of My Supreme Pen and hearkened unto My most sweet call. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. Remember your Lord with wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard what he was bidden by God, the Ancient Commander. We beseech God to aid you to champion His Cause through wisdom and utterance, and to ordain for you that which shall gladden the eyes of them that are nigh unto Him.\n\nThus hath the fragrance of utterance wafted throughout the realm of possibility, when the All-Merciful seated Himself upon His mighty throne. The remembrances have ended with your mention, and the pages with your praise. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus hath the Dove of the Throne warbled by command of God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. The splendor shining from the horizon of My prison be upon you and upon those whom neither the remembrance of any remembrance nor any matter, nor the might of the people and their hosts, nor the swords of men and their doings have deterred. They arose and proclaimed: \"He Who is the Manifestation of clear proofs hath come with the standards of signs. He, verily, is the One promised in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\"\n\nO Supreme Pen! The utterance hath returned from the presence of the All-Merciful once again in remembrance of the people of Baha in the Ta and the Fa and other lands. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We make mention of the Alif and the Ha that he may rejoice and be among the thankful at eventide and at dawn. O Ahmad! We testify that thou hast attained unto My verses and heard My call and turned to My horizon while the people were in heedlessness and error. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath mentioned thee in what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Tablets, and blessed is he who hath turned unto God and whom the might of the servants hath not deterred from God, the Lord of lords. We make mention of Muhammad-'Ali and give him the glad tidings of My loving-kindness and bounty which hath preceded all creation. Hear the call from the Supreme Pen - verily it mentioneth thee in such wise as doth gladden eyes. We have sent down for thee a tablet and dispatched it to thee aforetime that thou mightest rejoice and be in rapture and attraction.\n\nAnd We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Sadiq, who turned to the supreme horizon when the people were turning away from God, the Lord of lords. Give thanks unto God for that the Tongue of Grandeur hath mentioned thee while the Wronged One was in the hands of the wicked. Thou hast drunk the cup of bounty from the hand of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings, and attained unto that which was recorded in the Scriptures and Tablets. We beseech God to assist thee and strengthen thee in remembrance and praise. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-i-Baqir, who attained the days of God, the Revealer of verses. He turned to God when the peoples of the earth turned away. He took hold of the Book when those who denied God's truth and His proof cast it behind them, and disbelieved, following every ignorant doubter. We made mention of thee before, and do so at this hour. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. And We make mention of 'Ali-Akbar from My Most Luminous Horizon, that God's remembrance may bear witness unto him through the eternity of His names and attributes. He is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. We counsel thee and those who have believed in what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. O My loved ones in that land! Hold fast unto that which ye are commanded by the Lord of Religions. The Wronged One hath remembered His loved ones while in the Most Great Prison - to this the Mother Book with Him doth testify. Give thanks unto God for having aided you when the Light was shining from the Most Exalted Station.\n\nO Pen of the Ancient King! He desireth to make mention of His loved ones in Shin and Ha, that this remembrance may draw them to the Most Exalted Station. God eraseth what He willeth and confirmeth what He pleaseth - a command from His presence. He is the Hearing, the All-Seeing. We made mention of you before with that which caused the breezes of grace and bounty to waft. Let not the turning away of those who have broken the Covenant grieve you. Blessed is he who hath heard My call, and the learned one who hath held fast to what was sent down from the heaven of My will, and the eye that hath beheld the lights. We informed you aforetime of what was hidden and made known to you the straight path. This is a day wherein clear proofs have appeared and the river of mercy hath flowed among the righteous. Joy unto him who hath drawn nigh and drunk, and woe unto every heedless imposter. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those whom the turning away of the people hath not kept back from God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Compelling.\n\nO earth! Is there within thee one who loveth Me, and hast thou been honored by one who remembereth Me? Be truthful with Me and be not of those who remain silent. Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily He remembereth thee and those who have believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. We have made the earth Our treasury and storehouse, and have manifested from it Our favor and the tokens of Our bounty, and I am the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed art thou in that God hath made thee the dayspring of His favors and the source of His bounties, and hath manifested through thee that which revealeth His power, His majesty, and His sovereignty. From thee come wealth and riches and that which profiteth mankind. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this magnificent favor.\n\nWe make mention at this hour of My loved ones and My friends, and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus doth the horizon of utterance reveal its light and the Tree of Knowledge its fruits. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and attained, and woe unto the heedless. O Land of Qaf and Vav! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee and of His loved ones within thee, that the eyes of the world and of those who have turned to this shining horizon may be solaced thereby. O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto My call. Verily, He calleth you from the prison unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Cast away what the people possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings, holding fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. That which was hidden from eternity hath appeared, and He Who was promised in God's Books, the Lord of the Glorious Throne, hath come. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you or the doubts of the nations grieve you. Turn with your hearts unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We counsel the friends and chosen ones of God to fear God and to observe that whereby Our Cause, firm and manifest, may be exalted. Blessed is the servant who hath adorned his head with the crown of righteousness and his temple with the ornament of virtuous deeds. He is indeed among those who are nigh unto God in the Book of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nO My loved ones in Merv! Hearken unto the call of Him Who summoneth you for the sake of God and desireth to draw you nigh unto Him. Blessed is he who heareth and respondeth, and woe unto every remote denier. Azizullah hath mentioned you time and again and hath sent your names unto the Wronged One, and each one of you hath been honored with tokens from My Most Exalted Pen. To this beareth witness He Who speaketh in every state that there is none other God but I, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Take hold of the Book of God with the strength bestowed by Us and be not of the heedless. Beware lest the doubts of the nations and the happenings of the world prevent you, or your feet slip through the oppression of the wrongdoers. Thank God for His grace and bounty that He created you and caused you to appear in this Day round which circle the Concourse on High and the denizens of Paradise at morn and eventide. The mention of Me is not equaled by the mention of the world, nor My manifestation by the manifestation of the ancients. Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon and say: \"Here am I, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! Praise be unto Thee for having made known unto us the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, the Source of Thy Command and the Manifestation of Thy laws. We beseech Thee by the Most Exalted Paradise and by the souls which have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, O Lord of all beings, to aid us to be steadfast in Thy love and to arise to serve Thy Cause. Then ordain for us the good of this world and the world to come. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"\n\nAll the people of Kha have been blessed with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty. We have mentioned them all and have beseeched from God for each that which is lasting and enduring. The loved ones must strive and protect the people from vain imaginings, lest they be afflicted as were the people of the past. Likewise, We counsel all to trustworthiness, religious devotion, goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, that the world may be adorned with the ornament of virtuous conduct, and that the fire of hatred burning in the breasts of diverse peoples may be quenched by the living waters of the love of God's loved ones, their kindly counsels and goodly exhortations, and that all on earth may be seen as one people. This is the essential purpose. Blessed are they who shall gird up the loins of endeavor for this mighty service. At all times seek this station from the Beloved of all possibility, that He may aid His servants to achieve that which hath been mentioned. We have written repeatedly: One person was engaged in fishing when the Spirit (Jesus) made him the fisher of men. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayer. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you, O My loved ones, My friends and My beloved ones who have attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God and treasured in the hearts of the Messengers. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH00055 ===\n\n=== START BH00056 ===\n\nIn the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nGod, there is no God but Him, Who speaks in all things that there is no God but Him. His is the glory and the majesty, the power and the beauty, and He is the One Who distinguishes through His Word between truth and falsehood, darkness and light, ignorance and knowledge, acceptance and rejection. He is the One with power, Whose might all things acknowledge and Whose praise is celebrated by all in the kingdom of command and creation. He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Glory and praise, grandeur and splendor, exaltation and eminence be upon the Hands of His Cause, who did not break His covenant and testament, and who traveled through cities and villages to exalt His Word, guide His creation, manifest His Cause, and spread His signs. The servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen them, prosper them, protect them, guard them, aid them, support them, and inspire them with that which will draw the servants near to the horizon of care and favors.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The traces of the pen which were cast upon the page from a tender and gentle heart did truly open the gate of reunion and brought to remembrance the days of that beloved one's presence, and in one respect were a harbinger. God knoweth that from each of its words wafted such a fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds that none had any choice or pause save to exclaim \"Blessed be God Who inspires His loved ones with that which attracts the hearts of those who have turned towards Him.\" Exalted be our Creator, our Protector, and our Helper! After perusal and reading, it was taken to the Most Exalted Station and the Most Holy, Luminous, and Resplendent Spot, and was presented before the countenance of the Lord of Names, attaining the honor of His attention. This is what the Lord of the Beginning and the End spoke, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious\n\nThy name was presented and We heard thy call and found the fragrance of thy love, thy sincerity, and thy turning to God, the Mighty, the Great. The servant who was present offered up that which thou didst commune with God, Who hath taken for Himself a station in the prison, and therein raised His call and manifested His Cause and His sovereignty, and spoke before the faces of His servants, and opened the gate of His grace, and raised the heaven of His utterance, and adorned it with the lights of His verses. He, verily, hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the rein of utterance, and He is the Single One, the Mighty, the Bestower.\n\nO Son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The sinners shall be known by their marks. This is the Day wherein the secrets of hearts and the betrayal of eyes shall be revealed. Today in the Great City there hath appeared that which was hidden. They have clung to calumnies that have no likeness, neither now nor ever. Yahya and Shaykh Muhammad have sought after their own kind and are engaged in corruption. No sooner doth anyone turn towards this land than instantly telegraph messages arrive claiming that such-and-such person hath committed theft and gone to 'Akka. Among these was the honored Afnan, Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. Shortly after he set out for the Most Holy Court, before his arrival in Beirut, telegraphic messages arrived claiming that Siyyid Ahmad and his companions had stolen money and were traveling thither for this reason. Thus have their souls seduced them. The station whose sanctity and detachment all fair-minded ones testify unto, the sources of oppression have sought to besmirch with the dust of calumnies. Mushiru'd-Dawlih Mirza Husayn Khan--may God forgive him--witnessed the arrival of the Wronged One and His conduct, speech and deeds in the Great City, and understood, and made mention of it in the assemblage of the companions of the government and nation. Praise be to God Who hath revealed what was hidden in the hearts of the heedless and the idolators. We beseech Him to cause His loved ones to circle round His will with such steadfastness as shall cause the hearts of the oppressors and transgressors to tremble. Today the Cause of God is as manifest as the sun and hath appeared with such power as hath neither been seen nor heard. Nevertheless, the oppressor of Dawlat-Abad, as soon as he heareth that a soul hath turned towards the Faith, either he himself or some other calumniator like him hasteneth with all manner of schemes to lead astray. Say: My God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge, then cast upon them that which shall preserve them from the evil of Thine enemies. Unfairness hath reached such a pass that they have denied the bounty of this Revelation. While Yahya is occupied in flight and he remaineth concealed in his house, the Wronged One standeth before the faces of all. At times in prison, at times beneath chains. When the effulgences of the light of the divine Sun of utterance did somewhat shine forth, they emerged from behind the veil and committed that which causeth the realities of all things to weep and lament, and the Spirit of the Cause to be seen crying out.\n\nAmong them, he met with Khalil in Sabzivar and said that which God is aware of. Yet how strange of Khalil to give way to one so heedless! Say: O Khalil! Know that the deeds of Hadi were first deceit and guile, which have entered into this Cause. Purify thy hem from his whisperings and the whisperings of his like. In early Islam such heedless souls did that which bore fruit on the Day of Reckoning when they hung and martyred the Lord of being. O Khalil! In truth I say that such souls were never with Us and know not the foundation of the Cause. Turn to the holy verses that the truth may become manifest to thee. Today the breathings of verses have encompassed the world. The seal of the choice sealed wine has been broken in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Deprive not thyself. Arise to serve the Cause with divine power and might. The world is transient and what is with God endures. From the beginning of Islam until now not one among the divines has understood the nature of the Revelation, and among the Shi'ih faction naught has existed save cursing and reviling. O Khalil! Look from the horizon of the House in thy Lord's name. Say: O people! Hear! Hear! By God, the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised from the prison of Akka. Behold! Behold! The Light hath shone forth and radiated from the heaven of God's will, the Lord of the worlds. O Khalil! Ask none, for We sent thee aforetime verses that all the treasuries of kings and what the servants possess cannot equal. To this doth the Lord of creation bear witness in this glorious and wondrous station. O Khalil! God willing, through the grace of the All-Glorious Lord thou shalt not again fall into the well of vain imaginings. Consider the learned and ignorant among the Shi'ih faction. They counted themselves the greatest, most exalted, most learned and most God-fearing on earth, and the cause was one like Hadi. O Khalil! Reflect on the edifices they built and repaired with hands of fancy and idle imagination. Consent no more that such vain imaginings should arise. Alas! Alas! Those imaginings were transformed into tyranny and the great terror appeared, and thou hast heard what they brought to pass. Even now the divines are engaged in cursing and reviling from their pulpits. Consider the reason for this, that perchance thou mayest drink the wine of certitude from the hand of the bounty of the Goal of the world's desire, and mayest not consent that another faction like the former should appear in the land. Preserve the servants by a command from the Ancient Commander. O Khalil! In the days when the darkness of might had seized the world, none appeared save this Wronged One, yet when the light of the Cause partly dawned they attacked this Wronged One with swords of hatred. What behooveth thee today is to arise with the utmost humility and submission, and turning toward God's Kaaba, to utter these exalted words:\n\nMy God, my God, my Lord and my Support! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, by the mysteries hidden in Thy Book, and by the verses sent down from the clouds of Thy bounty, to aid me to detach myself from all else but Thee and to hold fast to the cord of Thy loving providence. O Lord! Assist me to remain steadfast in the Greater Steadfastness and to turn to Thy gate which Thou hast opened to all in earth and heaven. Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Lord! Protect Thy servants from the whisperings of the calumniators and the cawing of those who caw, who have broken Thy Covenant and Testament, denied Thy verses, and disputed Thy proofs and evidence. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. There is no God but Thee, the All-Giving, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nO Khalil! Upon thee be the Glory of God! In past years, verses were repeatedly revealed from the heaven of bounty especially for thee and sent through Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon him be My glory. Read them, detached from the world; verily they will draw thee to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Reflect well upon the former party, what was their recompense on the Day of Resurrection and what befell them, that perchance ye may not again fall into the snare. The Sunnis and the community who were detested by all the people of Iran, without any teaching, through mere association, a group accepted the Faith, and a person in Sudan claimed to be the Mahdi and a hundred thousand gathered around him, while the oppressive and unjust Shi'ih committed that which no tongue hath power to describe. This is the day of the verse which saith: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds,\" and likewise He saith: \"We verily sent Moses with Our signs, saying: 'Bring forth thy people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.' In this surely are signs for every patient, grateful one.\" Although the days of the Manifestation are also counted among the days of God, these days are specifically the days of God mentioned in the divine Books. O Khalil! Those souls like Hadi and others are considered by the believer as the first to believe, and by the disbeliever as the first to deny. By the life of God! He is not among the horsemen of the arena of knowledge and wisdom. I say in truth: Take hold of the Book with such might that neither armies nor ranks shall deter thee, and with such power that the oppression of tyrants and the clamor of aggressors shall not weaken it.\n\nHis is the grace, bounty and bestowals, in that He hath revealed to His servants the pearls of the treasures of His knowledge and the jewels of the repositories of His utterance. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. In truth every fair-minded one is bewildered and every possessor of justice is astonished, for the party that considered itself the most excellent and exalted of all the peoples of the world - on the Day of Reckoning there appeared from them that which had never occurred from the beginning of the world until now. At one time He said: O servant present! The lamentations and wailing of the pulpits of Iran are raised high, and with most eloquent tongue they cry out saying: \"O God! O Lord! O Support! O Goal! O Beloved! Thou didst create us for Thy mention and praise and graciously ordained us thus. Now we have become the abode of the enemies of Thy Self. Thou art the All-Hearing and the All-Seeing. Thou hearest what they say and hast witnessed what they have done and what they do.\" And now again some are engaged in organizing such a party.\n\nThis servant, in view of the love and sincerity that has existed for his honor, deemed it necessary to mention certain matters that have transpired, for the ungodly have resorted to trickery and deception, turning their attention to anyone with whom they have heard a conversation. All are aware that these souls had been hidden for years from the sovereign power of the days, and when through the might of the King of Kings the Cause was raised up and the call was heard from every quarter and the luminary of utterance shone forth from every direction, they emerged with swords of hatred and animosity. Surely they are aware how many souls, attracted by the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds, set out for the place of sacrifice and freely offered up their lives at the feet of the Lord of all beings. However, as soon as Mirza Hadi heard that he was called a Babi, his very foundations were seized with trepidation, and for the sake of two days of earthly life, he forsook eternal life and everlasting existence, and spoke from the pulpit that which befitted none but himself. By the life of our Purpose, he uttered that which caused the Holy Spirit to lament. In every place he mounted a pulpit and spoke, and from one pulpit he disavowed the Faith and thus saved himself from death. O beloved of my heart! His very existence bears witness to his hypocrisy, while the Twin Luminous Lights, his honor Ashraf, and before them his honor Kazim - upon them all be the Most Glorious Glory - the martyrdom of each stands as a clear testimony to their faith, recognition, steadfastness and certitude. Those possessed of insight and hearing, were they to contemplate and observe with the eye of fairness and the ear of justice all that hath been manifested from the beginning of this Most Great Revelation until now, would all proclaim: \"We turn toward Thee, O God of the worlds!\" Glory be to God! Despite the sacrifice of holy souls, their spirits and possessions, as well as their arising to serve the Cause before the faces of mankind, the deluded ones continue to wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and the desert of vain imaginings. Although all know that he and his like had no knowledge of the essence of this Cause, for they were not with the Truth. This servant has been present in service for nearly forty years, and all are aware of this fact; yet none have inquired of this servant that they might be illumined by the light of truth, and that there might not appear again that which would become the cause of countless afflictions and endless tribulations. In any case, this ephemeral one has spoken and continues to speak for the sake of God, that his honor might be aware and arise to serve the Cause with manifest certitude - an arising that will find no sitting and will not be altered. The Desired One, Who through divine power and the might of the Lord arose before the faces of princes and divines, did not seek concealment nor resort to veiling, but proclaimed the divine laws and ordinances. They have avoided Him because they are worshippers of vain imaginings, and his honor is aware of the Tablet to the Sultan which was sent from the Most Holy Court, and likewise the letters to the kings. O beloved of my heart! The opposers have manifested an oppression that has had and has no equal, and in previous years, Tablets were repeatedly revealed and sent specifically for his honor, and his honor Ibn-i-Ismu'llah al-Asdaq - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - was charged with conveying them. Take hold of the reins of the Cause with the power from God, our Lord \\[...\\]\n\nAmong those charged with teaching was the honored Ibn-i-Ismu'llah-i-Asdaq, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Take hold of the reins of the Cause through the power of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne, then guide the people to His straight path and His mighty Message. Now close to one hundred volumes of verses and evidences have been sent down from the heaven of divine will. The calumnies have reached such a state that every possessor of truthfulness, justice and fairness bears witness to the oppression of those heedless souls. For the sake of God I shall relate one account, that the station of the slanderers and liars might become somewhat known.\n\nOne day the honored Haji Siyyid Javad, known as Karbila'i, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, attained the presence and submitted that His Holiness's uncle Haji Mirza Siyyid Muhammad and the other uncle, upon them both be the Glory of God, had attained the pilgrimage of Najaf and Karbila and were now returning with the intention of going back to their homeland. The Ancient Beauty asked, \"Have you said anything to them?\" He submitted \"No.\" He commanded, \"Why not? You should be engaged in teaching the Cause of God. Now go, convey Our greetings and bring them into Our presence.\" He guided them to the court of glory and majesty.\n\nThe next day they returned with His Holiness's uncle and attained the presence, but only the elder uncle came, without his other brother. After attaining the presence, the waves of the ocean of utterance of the Goal of all the worlds appeared in such wise that none could enumerate them. Finally He said, \"We do not wish for you to remain deprived of the blessed Tree that has grown up in your midst and is adorned with the fruits of wisdom and utterance.\"\n\nHe submitted, \"My Master, for one thousand two hundred years we have heard that the Qa'im dwells in well-known, famous cities, and that His children each exist in those cities in perfect glory and grandeur, and that if anyone mentioned a word about His birth, they would immediately seize him and shed his blood. Moreover, what became of the account of the sacred precinct? Where did the mention of the sea and the carpet go? And likewise we have heard from all the divines of the Shi'ih party that His Holiness will come and appear and will pay the debts of the Shi'ihs and will conquer the whole earth, and likewise mentions that this servant is unable to relate, as it would take too long. Finally they say that He is your sister's son - how can this servant accept this? What was said before is now contrary to what is manifest as the sun. I know not what is my duty.\"\n\nThen the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted word: \"O uncle! Now return to your dwelling and properly consider the traditions and aforementioned doubts and whatever causes your hesitation, and come back with your brother. If God wishes, He will transform doubts into decisive verses. Verily He has power over all things.\"\n\nThe next day he came without his brother and mentioned the doubts one by one, and the answer was revealed. And what was revealed became known among the servants as the Epistle to the Uncle, and later due to consummate wisdom the name \"Uncle\" was removed and it became known as the Book of Certitude. Now this same Mirza Hadi and his like have said the Book of Certitude is from Mirza Yahya. All the Afnan are present - you may investigate so that the lies of the slanderers may become known.\n\nThis testimony was later designated as the Book of Certitude. Now this same Mirza Hadi has claimed to his followers that the Book of Certitude is from Mirza Yahya. All the Afnan are present - you may investigate so that the falsehood of these slanderers may become clear and evident. It is hoped that you will overlook the unseemly statements of those people and turn to the sacred texts. The Cause will become as clear as the sun to you.\n\nO my God, my God! This is Thy servant and Thy devotee. Thou knowest and seest that he speaketh not of his own accord, but rather by what Thou hast caused him to know through Thy grace and taught him through Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world and the One manifest through the Most Great Name, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to repent at the door of Thy grace. Then enable them to make amends for that which hath escaped them in Thy days. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of the beginning and the end.\n\nAccording to His command, whatever hath been revealed in the name of Mirza Hadi Dawlat-Abadi and is in the possession of the friends should be gathered and written down and delivered by trustworthy hands to Jinab-i-Khalil, upon him be the glory of God, that he may examine them, and likewise the Books of Verses. Then let them be taken back. It has been some years since a Tablet was specifically revealed in his name, although previously verses were repeatedly revealed and sent in his name, each one a manifest proof and a shining evidence for the establishment of the Cause. Ere long from all corners of the world the cry of \"Yea, yea!\" and \"Here am I, here am I!\" shall be raised, for there hath been and is no escape for anyone. We beseech God, our Lord and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, to assist all to do that which He loveth and desireth.\n\nMention was made of His Holiness, the departed and forgiven, the late Jinab-i-Fa'iz, upon him be the glory of God, the Most Glorious. After it was submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sublime and decisive words were revealed specifically for him. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaketh thus:\n\nHe is the Expositor, the Compassionate, the Generous\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and he who hath attained in His days is indeed the attainer, and was thus named by His holy, mighty and wondrous tongue. We testify that he attained unto faith in the early days and drank the choice wine of knowledge from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful. He it is whom God adorned with the ornament of supreme steadfastness, such that neither the clamor of the people nor the roaring of those who denied the final judgment could deter him. O Fa'iz! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. Rejoice thou in the Most Exalted Paradise, inasmuch as the Lord of all beings hath made mention of thee in the prison of Akka. Blessed be thy tongue for having acknowledged the unity of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, and for having confessed that which the Supreme Pen hath revealed from the Most Glorious Horizon. Blessed be thy heart for having turned to the horizon of Revelation and thine ear for having heard the call of Him Who conversed upon Sinai when it was raised in truth - the call whereby the Trump was sounded, the inhabitants of the graves arose, and the Day of Resurrection appeared. Blessed be thine eyes - We testify that they attained unto the signs of God and unto the vision of those who cast the world behind their backs, turning unto the Dayspring of His verses, the Dawning-Place of His evidences, and the Source of His laws. Blessed be thy face for having turned toward His direction, and thine ear for having heard His sweetest call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee from the heaven of His generosity the rains of His mercy, to grant thee of the fruits of the Tree beyond which there is no passing, both morn and eve, and to open before thee at all times the gates of loving providence, grace and beneficence. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord, my Support, my Goal and my Beloved! I testify to the oneness of Thy Being and to the sanctity of Thy Self above all likeness and comparison. I acknowledge Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy majesty and Thy might. I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Goal of all creation, by the standards of Thy signs and the banners of Thy guidance, by the resplendent, shining Light that hath dawned from the horizon of Thy Will through Thy command and might, by the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha and the flowing of the Kawthar of life in the Most Exalted Paradise, and by this most pure dust and this sanctified tomb, to fulfill my needs and forgive me, my father and mother, and those who have believed in Thee and Thy signs. O Lord! Ordain for me the good of the hereafter and this world, and that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen servants who were not hindered by the doubts of the world nor the intimations of the nations from turning toward the court of Thy glory and drawing nigh unto the precincts of Thy majesty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nPraise be to God! After mention was made of the ascension of his honor the departed one, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, this servant beheld before him the waves of the ocean of grace and forgiveness. From all directions, great mercy and supreme bounties were directed towards the departed one. It is hoped that his sons will take his station and hold fast to that which befitteth these days. Mention of them was also made in the Most Holy Court. Thanks be to God, and glory be unto Him, and bounty be His, for there appeared from the Tongue of Grandeur that which made up for what was lost. This servant beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever is the cause of success and confirmation. Exalted is the grace of these days, and His bounty, and His mercy, and His favor.\n\nSpecifically regarding the deceased one, there appeared from the Tongue of Grandeur that which hath caused him to attain unto eternal life and everlasting bounty. Well is it with him and pleasant it is unto him. According to the Command, mention ye his sons and relatives, upon them be the Glory of God, and counsel them to patience and resignation. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nThe names mentioned in the letter of that beloved of hearts were presented before the Throne of God, exalted be His glory, and each attained unto that which hath no likeness or equal. This is what was revealed for his honor Rafi' - upon him be the Glory of God - His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise\n\nThis is a day wherein the trees of the Most Exalted Paradise have yielded the fruits of wisdom and utterance, wherein the stream of the water of life hath flowed forth in the name of God, the Lord of all possibilities, and the light hath shone forth from the horizon of manifestation, inasmuch as He Who conversed with God hath been established upon the throne of utterance. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath come with power and sovereignty. O Rafi'! Upon thee be My wondrous Glory. Rejoice in that We have turned toward thee from this Scene whereby the horizons have been illumined, and We have mentioned thee with a mention before which all mention boweth down when it appeareth from the Tongue. Hold thou fast unto the cord of bounty and cling to the hem of the mercy of thy Lord, the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names. Beware lest the sayings of the heedless sadden thee or the doubts of those who have denied God, the Lord of all men, veil thee. Take thou the Book with a strength from Us. Verily, it will draw thee nigh unto the supreme horizon, the station wherein the Caller hath cried out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all men.\" Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Possessor of this world and the next, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the throne and the dust, for having guided me and drawn me nigh and revealed unto me that which shall endure through the eternity of Thy names and attributes. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Yusuf Khan, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the Trustworthy Speaker\n\nThis is a Book that walks and proclaims: \"The Promise has come to pass and this is the Promised One at Whose appearance all things spoke forth: 'By God, the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and earth has appeared!'\" This is the Day wherein that which was hidden throughout all eternity has been made manifest. To this testifies He Who spoke before all faces: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of all worlds!\" O Yusuf Khan! He Who loved Me and drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty hath made mention of thee. We have made mention of thee through verses that surpass all that hath been witnessed upon the earth or hidden in its strata. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as a token of His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Take thou the chalice of utterance in the name of the Beloved of all possibility, then drink therefrom. Verily it will draw thee to a station wherein all atoms proclaim: \"The Kingdom, the Dominion, the Grandeur and the Might belong to God, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Praised!\"\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Mirza Hidayat, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Powerful, the Supreme Ruler over all names\n\nBlessed art thou, O Hidayat, for God hath guided thee to His Most Great Announcement and His Straight Path. The joy of the Revelation hath taken possession of the realms of the unseen and the seen, yet most people remain heedless. They have cast behind their backs what they were commanded in the Book and have taken up that which was forbidden them, having followed every suspicious deceiver. Purify thy heart with the water of detachment and thy tongue with the Kawthar of utterance, and say:\n\n\"My God, my God! Thine is the bounty, for Thou hast given me to drink of the Kawthar of immortality, and Thine is the glory, for Thou hast guided me to Thy most exalted horizon. I testify that Thy grace hath encompassed earth and heaven. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and the mysteries of Thy Book and by Him through Whom the limbs of Thy servants have trembled, to make me so steadfast in Thy love that neither names shall prevent me from drawing nigh unto Thy court, nor things from turning to the lights of Thy countenance. O my Lord! Thou seest this servant of Thine clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and awaiting the manifestations of Thy pardon and generosity. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which lieth with Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\"\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nThe Straight Path hath appeared and the Balance hath been set. Command belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful. The trembling of the Revelation hath seized them that lie in the graves, and every hidden thing hath been made manifest, through the grace of God, the Lord of lords. We have heard thy call and have summoned thee from the right side of the luminous Vale, from the verdant Tree. God, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving.\n\nO Shaykh, O Isma'il! Know thou that the two most luminous Lights, Hasan and Husayn, hastened to the place of sacrifice in their longing to attain My presence. They came and were present and achieved what was ordained for them by God, the Lord of creation. Neither the world and its colors, nor the trees and their fruits held them back. They came forward and gave up their lives in the path of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. How many a servant hath advanced to the place of sacrifice and returned not, having sacrificed his soul in the love of God, the Dawning-Place of lights. When thou art blessed with My call and drinkest the choice wine of My utterance, say: \"My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and guided me to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Source of Thy inspiration. I beseech Thee by it and by its sovereignty and by its might and its glory to make me a helper of Thy Cause and one who standeth in service to it, in such wise that the doubts of the world and the opposition of the nations shall not cause me to slip. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nThis was revealed for his honor Haji Muhammad upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nIn My Name, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful\n\nThe Cause hath come, and that which was hidden from sight hath been made manifest. The verses have been sent down and the evidences have appeared, while the people remain in heedlessness and error, save those who have cast behind their backs all vain imaginings, turning unto God, the Lord of religions. The Dawning-Place of God's Revelation hath come, through which the tribes have lamented and earthquakes have appeared. Thus hath the matter been decreed from before God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. O Muhammad! Be thankful that the One, the Single, hath made mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison, whereby the hearts of the servants have been attracted. Say: O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon. Beware lest the vain imaginings of those who have denied God's Cause when it came with clear proof and evidence withhold you. O people! This is the Day of God, and this is the Day that was mentioned in the Books, the Psalms and the Tablets. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this Cause through which the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Thus hath the Book spoken as it walketh in the most exalted station. Among the people is he who hath said: \"Doth the Book walk?\" Say: Yea, by the Lord of lords, it walketh and speaketh, nay it eateth, in spite of every doubting denier. We beseech God to aid thee to attain such steadfastness whereby the feet of all mankind shall stand firm, and to assist thee in His remembrance and praise, and to cause thee to speak that which shall attract the hearts of people of understanding.\n\nThis was revealed for his honor Aqa Mirza Ahmad upon him be the Glory of God.\n\nHe is the Answerer through Wisdom and Utterance.\n\nGlory be to God! The light of the revelation of Him Who conversed with God on Sinai hath illumined the world, and the divine verses and proofs have encompassed all things to such a degree that no possibility of denial or rejection remaineth for the fair-minded. Blessed is he who hath attained to hear and see with his own ears and eyes. Glory be to God! Heedlessness hath reached such a state that they have given precedence to the Letters over the Mother Book. Say: O people of the Bayan, cast away your vain imaginings! By God, the Truth, the Sun of Certitude hath dawned from the horizon of God's Will, the Lord of the worlds. Free yourselves from the chains of names and proceed with freedom toward the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit. Today the fragrances of divine verses are diffused and hidden mysteries are manifest and visible. Deprive not yourselves and turn from what ye possess to what God possesseth. Today the ocean of bounty is surging and the heaven of grace is uplifted. Blessed is the soul whom the opposition of the turban-wearers hath not prevented from drawing nigh, nor held back from turning toward God. Thus doth the Wronged One make mention of thee on this darksome night that thou mayest give thanks and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all in the heavens and the earth.\"\n\nThanks be to God that each of the mentioned names hath attained unto the choice wine of the utterance of the Goal of all the worlds. We hope they will drink thereof and make it incumbent upon themselves to protect, according to their ability, the servants from the vain imaginings of the heedless Shi'ih party. Let them not be deprived of the Names and their Possessor. For twelve hundred years they said \"O Successor\" and remained deprived and forbidden from the Truth, exalted be His glory. At last their deeds, actions and words bore the fruit of shedding the Most Pure Blood. They said \"O 'Ali\" yet martyred the Lord of existence by Whose word a thousand 'Alis are created. In brief, this Day is the Day of God. Blessed is the soul that drinketh from this cup, detached from all else. Divine confirmation cometh from God, the Lord of Names and Attributes.\n\nMention was made of the beloved of the heart, His Holiness Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the everlasting glory of God. According to the command, he was bidden to visit the friends and return. That beloved of the heart must be engaged in service night and day, and be vocal in the mention and praise of God. The companions of this Most Great Revelation must be so steadfast that neither the world nor whatsoever is therein of servants, things, colors, ornaments and books shall hold them back from the Supreme Horizon. Perchance the true treasures may be revealed - those men who consider all save God as utter nothingness. The barkers are many, appearing in every city and land. This is among the tidings that flowed from the Supreme Pen in Iraq, the Land of Mystery, and the first Most Great Prison. This land too hath not been and is not free of barkers. I convey greetings to the beloved of the soul, Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the glory and favor of the All-Merciful, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for his assistance. Praise be to God, he is mentioned in His presence and hath attained His favor. I convey greetings, mention and praise to the friends of that land, and I beseech for them that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God and the elevation of their station.\n\nMention was made of the spiritual friend Aqa Ahmad, upon him be the glory and favor of God. After it was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, these sublime, decisive and blessed verses were revealed especially for him from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Names and Attributes. His words, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nPraise, in its essence, and thanksgiving, in its reality, beseech the holy threshold of nearness to the Desired One, Who, through His pervading, attractive, and absolute Will, brought forth the wondrous creation from sheer nothingness and adorned it with the ornament of being. This creation is sanctified and purified from that which is possessed by the people - that is, the former party and the Bayan and what they possess - for without this wondrous decree, in the first station and primary rank, none other would be true. Blessed is the breast that is sanctified from the world's impressions through the Name \"O Pure One,\" and blessed is the ear that is purified from the false tales of the nations. These are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, whose mention was revealed, established, fixed and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Qayyumu'l-Asma'. O Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. The letters thou didst send to this servant who is present have each been honored to be heard and distinguished by a special glance of favor. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy father, through whose presence God hath adorned the surface of the earth, and through whose body He hath adorned its depths. By My life! We have revealed for him that which cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the world, nor by the utterances of the learned, nor by the sighs of the mystics, nor by the lamentations of the philosophers. The intention of the learned, mystics and philosophers in these stations are those souls who adorn themselves with outward means while inwardly they are barriers preventing the peoples of the world; otherwise the true mystic, the spiritual scholar, and the divine philosopher are, in the arena of the manifestation of the Lord of religions, seated upon the throne of certitude. O Ahmad! God willing, thou shalt be even as an enkindled fire and as a light shining and radiant, in such wise that all may find the divine path through the warmth of thy love, distinguish truth from falsehood, and attain to such steadfastness that the movement of the world will not move them and the clamor of the nations will not cause them to slip. Convey to the loved ones of that land and its surrounding regions greetings and peace from the Wronged One. Say: Rejoice in that the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen hath turned towards you and hath mentioned you with a mention He hath made the sovereign of mentions and their source. It behooveth them to say: \"Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of earth and heaven! Glory be to Thee, O Sovereign of the most exalted Paradise! Thanks be to Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the supreme Paradise hath bowed down in submission! We beseech Thee, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations, to aid us to arise to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the hosts and ranks shall not prevent us. O Lord! Thou seest us detached from all save Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy power. Ordain for us that which beseemeth Thy bounty, Thy giving, Thy mercy and Thy favors. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and in Thy right hand are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\" The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whom God hath related to thee and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of this mighty and exalted station.\n\nThis lowly one also conveyeth unto them greetings, praise, glory and light. God is witness and testifier that they have not been forgotten and will ever occupy a station in the court of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds. It is hoped that from the trees of being there shall appear pure and goodly fruits that will cause the exaltation of the Word of God and the world will become blessed with the bounty of nearness. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer.\n\nConcerning what was written about the esteemed son of the late, exalted Mulla Ghulam-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious: Some time ago, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for him, as well as a prayer of visitation from the Tongue of Grandeur, and these were sent forth. In truth, the effulgences of the light of God's grace--exalted be His glory--in relation to him and his esteemed son are even as a brilliant, resplendent light. His is the praise, His the thanks, His the glory, and His the splendor. I beseech God to grant them assistance and confirmation. After mention was made of his name before the Seat of the Purpose of all worlds, these decisive verses were revealed. He says, blessed and exalted be He:\n\n\"O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Some time ago verses were sent down from the direction of the Most Great Throne, through which the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the All-Merciful, was diffused, and through which the Sun of grace shone forth and that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of My dominion and My realm became manifest. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. That which hath no end hath appeared, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing Expositor.\" Time and again hath mention been made from the Most Exalted Pen of him who ascended to the Supreme Horizon. Give thanks and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Ocean of bounty, and thanks be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity! I beseech Thee to assist me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the hindrance of them that hinder, the harm of the oppressors, the fire of the aggressors, and the opposition of the opposers shall not hold me back.\"\n\nAs to what thou didst ask concerning the house, thou mayest use it to pay the debts of him who hath ascended unto Us. This behooveth thee and those who have laid hold on this firm cord. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!\n\nO son of My Name, the Most Truthful, the Most Holy! He who hath ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon hath attained unto that which most of mankind hath failed to attain. Give glad-tidings to Mahdi--upon him be My glory--and to those who are with him, of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. Praise be to God! The gaze of My loving-kindness is fixed upon thee. Give thou glad-tidings, one by one, to all who are related, of God's grace and bounty. All are mentioned in the Most Holy Court and have been adorned with His special favors and have attained thereunto. That which hath been ordained for them is such that were less than a needle's eye thereof to be revealed, all would be thunderstruck, save whom God willeth, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\n\nThou shouldst manifest such justice that its fame may encompass those regions. This beseemeth thee and thy kinship to this Most Holy, Most Great, Most Mighty, Most Luminous Cause. Be thou as a fire amongst the righteous ones, that all may find from thee the warmth of the love of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne and Seat. Time after time hast thou been blessed, and again and again hast thou heard that which, were it to be cast upon the mountains, would cause them to soar with longing for the mention of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus hath the tongue of My loving-kindness spoken, as a grace from My presence, that the rapture of utterance might seize thee and render thee moved and attracted, soaring in the atmosphere of thy Lord's love, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\n\nThis servant also conveys greetings, glorification and Baha to each of the kinfolk, and beseeches for them from the wondrous and infinite grace and mercy of God that which will cause the fruits of existence to appear. It is hoped that this supplication may be honored with acceptance and the world may benefit from these fruits, for these are the days of revelation and bounty and favor and sustenance encompass all. Verily our Lord is the Generous Giver, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. The spirit and praise and remembrance and glory and exaltation and grandeur be upon you and upon those related to you and upon those who love you and upon the companions of the Crimson Ark who make no mention of names and their kingdoms, nor of mirrors and their suns. These are in truth, in very truth, the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nThe Servant\n\n19 Rajab 1308\n\n=== END BH00056 ===\n\n=== START BH00057 ===\n\nHe who gazeth upon the Most Glorious, Most Luminous Countenance of God, his honor Varqa, upon him be the glory of God, Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath.\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord\n\nPraise, sanctified beyond mention or hearing, beseemeth the Lord of Names, Who hath illumined the world of man through the Sun of the heaven of knowledge, and hath adorned the firmament of wisdom with the stars of understanding. Before a single drop from the ocean of His knowledge, the world of learning seeth itself ignorant, dumb and mute; and before the manifestation of the Point of His Book, the realm of insight findeth itself blind and deaf. At the revelation of His Will, \"He doeth what He willeth\" standeth bewildered and amazed, and at the appearance of His power, \"He ordaineth what He pleaseth\" lieth struck down and prostrate. The domain of inner meanings trembleth at the movement of the Most Exalted Pen, and the kingdom of mystic knowledge boweth down in humility before the rays of the Sun of His utterance. The fragrant breeze of His garment hath made fresh and verdant the gardens in the hearts of His lovers, and the sweet perfume of His grace hath perfumed the realms of the soul. Through a single mention from Him the heaven of knowledge hath been raised up, and through a single call from Him the withered world hath been made fresh. How presumptuous that this evanescent servant should speak at this station! How grievous a loss that he should count himself among the living! We are but dead ones fallen in the wilderness of love and wonderstruck, waiting to see what the Kawthar of utterance shall graciously bestow - whether it shall return this transient form to nothingness or grant it life everlasting. His is the command; He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Seeing, the Witness, the All-Knowing.\n\nThis evanescent servant imploreth from God - exalted be His glory - His grace and mercy, compassion and favor, bounties and gifts. In the watches of the night and throughout the days, with utmost lowliness and supplication, he beseecheth divine confirmation for His chosen ones and loved ones, that all may arise to celebrate His praise and serve His Cause, and act according to that which God hath willed. God willing, it is hoped that holy souls who are detached and assured may become intoxicated with the wine of utterance and emerge in the realm of possibility to guide all religions to the horizon of the All-Merciful. How excellent is this blessed Day! How excellent is this holy Day wherein the breeze hath wafted, the tongue of unity hath spoken, and that which lay hidden in the treasuries of the power of our omnipotent Lord hath been revealed!\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O Thou unto Whom all things have turned, through Whom the earth hath been cleft asunder and the heaven rent apart, and unto the ocean of Whose Most Great Name the realities of all names have hastened! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, and by Thy sovereignty that dominateth all that hath been and shall be, to ordain for Thy loved ones from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit them in the world to come and in this world. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones among the wicked ones of Thy creation, and hearest their cry, their lamentation and their yearning in Thy days. I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst subdue all existence in the kingdoms of the unseen and the seen, to rend asunder the veil from the faces of Thy servants and Thy creation, that they may turn unto Thee and hearken unto Thy most sweet call which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven. O my Lord! Deliver them from whatsoever preventeth them from drawing nigh unto Thee and from attaining the precincts of the pavilions of Thy grandeur. O my Lord! Unveil unto them as Thou didst unveil unto Thy loved ones, and make Thyself known unto them, and that which Thou hast manifested through Thy power and sovereignty. Thou art He Whom conditions cannot frustrate nor intimations impede. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. With Thee is the knowledge of all things in a Book that none hath understood save Thyself. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nO beloved of My heart and cherished one of My soul! The whistling of the bird of thy utterance hath informed Me, and the warbling of the nightingale of thy praise and remembrance hath taught Me that which hath gladdened Me with a joy the servant is powerless to describe as it truly is. To this beareth witness thy Beloved and our Beloved, thy Goal and our Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When the breezes of love stirred Me and that which thou didst speak in praise of the Lord of Oneness attracted Me, I took the letter and turned to the Mighty, the Bestower, until I entered and appeared before the Throne and presented what was therein. Thereupon the Face of the Beloved turned toward Me and He, exalted be His glory, said: \"O Dove! That which was promised in the Book hath appeared and that which the possessors of understanding were powerless to comprehend hath been manifested. By His life! He hath come with verses around which circled the Mother Book. O Dove! The Book speaketh, yet the people understand not; the Balance crieth out, yet they perceive not; the Path calleth aloud, yet they comprehend not. They have cast the tablets of God behind their backs and have taken that which they were bidden by the daysprings of idle fancy - they who dispute the signs of God, break His Covenant, and deny His Cause that hath encompassed existence. Say: This is the Day whereon the Ocean of Life hath surged before the face of the All-Merciful, and the River of Knowledge and Utterance hath flowed from the right hand of the Throne, would that ye knew it. This is the Day whereon that which never appeared before hath appeared, and from the horizon of the Prison the Sun of Wisdom and Proof hath dawned, yet the followers of religions have turned away therefrom. Say: O people of the earth! Arise from your seats, then turn ye to the supreme horizon. By God! It hath been illumined through the name of your Lord, the Most Holy, the All-Glorious. Beware lest the conditions of creation withhold you from the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Say: He hath appeared with truth, and neither the oppression of the divines, nor the power of princes, nor the might of those who have turned away from the Truth, the Knower of things unseen, can prevent Him. Say: This is the Day of Utterance; arise from the slumber of vain desires, then make mention of the Lord of Names - this is better for you, would that ye knew it. This is the Day whereon every uprising one hath arisen to serve the Cause, and every speaking one hath spoken in praise of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Say: O people! Set aside what ye knew before and take what ye see today in its praiseworthy station. O Dove! The servant present hath presented thy letter and read it before the Face. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing. We have heard thy mention and thy praise and thy supplication, and We have found the fragrance of thy love and thy humility and thy submissiveness and thy turning unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Every word of thy words hath testified to the grandeur of God and His sovereignty and His manifestation and His appearance and His greatness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing. Rejoice thou in this remembrance whereby the Kawthar of Life hath flowed throughout creation and the Bird of Eternity hath warbled upon the branches. There is no God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. We have mentioned thee after thy return in various tablets with a mention whereby the hearts of the mystics were attracted. Be thou steadfast in the service of thy Lord's Cause, speaking His praise and guiding unto His straight path. O Dove! In the days when the Concourse of the Bayan were disturbed and scattered through the might of the followers of religions, this Wronged One arose alone to the Cause in such wise that neither the opposition of the divines, nor the clamor of the mystics, nor the oppression of princes could prevent Him from that which He desired. Verily My Most Exalted Pen hath, at all times, moved in the field of wisdom.\n\nNo truth-seeker was deterred from what He willed by the oppression of rulers. Verily My Most Exalted Pen hath, at all times, moved across the field of wisdom and utterance, until all heard its call and its proof and evidence were made manifest unto all. In certain years, such tribulations descended that none save divine knowledge could reckon their extent. Nevertheless, the Pen ceased not its movement through the nights and days, nor did the tongue choose silence. And when the Most Great Word was spread abroad and the banners of praise and glorification were hoisted upon the highest standards, and the sun of certitude somewhat shone forth, the croaking of the raven and buzzing of the fly emerged from behind the veil. I swear by the call of the Lord of Names that ascendeth from the prison, such fear and trepidation seized the heedless souls that they ran from town to town and sought refuge from mountain to mountain. Now they have appeared with utmost rancor and hatred, clinging to every means to lead souls astray. Strange it is that souls should cling to the source of suspicion and dawning-place of vain imaginings. They have lost who denied God, His verses, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His power, and followed one more lost than themselves before God, the Exalted, the Great.\n\nO beloved of My heart! In truth, people are more attracted to vain imaginings than to the manifestations of certitude. All the people of the Bayan know that this servant lived with that veiled person, and for successive years none but this servant was with him. Yet they accept whatever is said by those who had and have no knowledge thereof, while to this day not one of those souls hath inquired of this servant to learn of that from which they remain heedless and veiled. By Him Who caused all things to speak His praise and glorification, the followers, despite their lack of understanding, are observed to be many ranks higher and more exalted than their leader. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, I have spoken and do speak for God's sake, that perchance some might, through the power of utterance, rend asunder the veils and attain unto the lights of the divine Morn and that which hath appeared therein. God, exalted be His glory, will, God willing, aid them to reach the station where they will extinguish the lamp of idle fancies - for the morn of certitude hath dawned. But alas, alas! For selfish desires bring about heedlessness, and imaginary veils prevent the heart and vision from witnessing.\n\nIt is most difficult for some parties who have been nurtured on vain imaginings and idle fancies to be saved, for they are seen to be bound by the chains of conjecture and fetters of idle fancy. And the followers of the Furqan are seen to be more veiled than all other peoples, for before their faces are empty tales, behind them false reports, on their right conjectural mentions, and on their left fanciful thoughts. In these days, regarding these matters, this blessed and holy word shone forth from the horizon of the Will of the Revealer of verses, exalted be His glory: \"Ja'far, the brother of 'Askari, was asked whether his brother left any offspring. He replied there was a child who died.\" When the fabricated temples heard this word, they rejected it and called him a liar. Observe to what degree oppression had reached and to what level calumny had risen. Then mention was made of the Holy Precinct and the appearance of missives, with all the details you have previously heard. May God grant justice to the likes of such souls who lead poor people in the wilderness of conjecture \\[...\\]\n\nThe mention of the Epistles was made with the same details as you have heard before. May God grant justice regarding such souls who caused the helpless people to wander in the wilderness of suspicion and delusion, surpassing even Abu Lahab in their deeds. Now for a long time this title of 'liar' will persist among the people of Pharaoh for that truthful Speaker. These false and lying souls cling to the same pretensions; their basic approach follows the same path and way. The receptive souls must be made aware so they may become informed and not be deprived of what God has willed through the whisperings of Satan's party. I swear by the brightness of the Sun of Justice that this Wronged One's purpose is that powerful souls should arise to promote the Cause and protect people from the evil of satans until they reach a station where they see themselves independent of what has passed and consider all else but Truth as non-existent and null. Say: O friends, fix your gaze upon the horizon of the Cause and upon what has appeared from it. This is the counsel of Truth to His friends. And in another place, this exalted Word shone forth from the heaven of utterance of the Lord of all beings, exalted be His grandeur: \"Until now We have not completely rent asunder the veils that exist among the people of the Furqan (Qur'an), nor have We completely shattered the idols of vain imaginings. If these two were to occur, by the Lord of the worlds, the people of the Bayan would find themselves in the lowest of the low.\" The Finger of Power has rent some asunder and the Arm of Might has destroyed some, yet many remain intact. Had the capacity been observed in the people of the Bayan, all would surely have attained the recognition of that which is mentioned with God. But God bears witness that they are more veiled than the people of the Furqan and other peoples, and I am the One Who takes account, the All-Knowing.\n\nThe people of the Furqan are so encompassed by vain imaginings that every writer is incapable of describing them, especially the party that considers itself saved. The people of the Sunnah and the Community believe that the Qa'im must be born, for they say no tradition has been seen from the Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - indicating His existence in Jabulqa or Jabulsa or elsewhere. Rather, the tradition of the Lord of Mankind - upon Him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power - as well as the narration of the Most Great Sheikh, indicate the birth of the Qa'im in the lands of Persia. How many holy souls who believed in birth were martyred through manifest tyranny! Strange it is that although they observe that the \"saved sect\" has been the tyrannical and rebellious sect, and at the time of test they proved to be more wretched and misguided than all on earth - for this unsaved sect suspended the Beauty of Unity in the air and perpetrated what the first and the last would shrink from doing.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the people of the Bayan to reflect upon what occurred among the people of the Furqan, that perchance the eye of truth might open and see what must be seen. In this case, they would be mentioned as people of insight in the Most Great Scene; otherwise, animals are nobler than them. From God, exalted be His glory, in all conditions this servant of the All-Glorious beseeches and hopes that He may observe with His grace, compassion and favor, not according to the objectors and deniers and what they possess, that perchance the morning breeze of mercy might pass by in this divine Day and adorn all with the ornament of witnessing, justice and fairness.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about your honored father, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, it was mentioned some time ago in the Most Holy Presence with the most wondrous utterance, and he attained. Reflect upon the sincerity and station of that holy soul, who reached such a position that the Ancient Beauty would pause in His comings and goings and mention him with the most wondrous utterance. By the life of the Beloved! This is a great station and a great bounty. Blessed is he and blessed is his presence. Verily, the bounty is in His hand - He gives as He pleases. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. That blessed Tablet was sent with Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, it will arrive and they will attain unto it. And it appears that at the time of its revelation, the aforementioned person was himself present.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about having sent copies of what was sent to various regions, this was accepted in His presence. He said: \"God willing, may they be confirmed in spreading the divine verses and His evidences, attributes and manifestations.\"\n\nAnd regarding your intention to travel to those parts, this is most beloved, for the people are weak and have not been and are not aware of certain matters. Often they cannot distinguish between the buzzing of a fly and the rustling of the Divine Lote Tree. Perhaps through meeting with you the veils may be rent asunder and they may truly become new in all respects. At one time this firm, perfect and blessed word shone forth from the horizon of the mouth of the King of Oneness - exalted be His grandeur: \"So long as the people of the Bayan look to the deeds, words, gestures and evidences of previous religions, they shall remain heedless and deprived of the new Order, the new creation, the new station and the new condition.\" And in another place this blessed word shone forth: \"Verily I am the Originator of the heavens and the earth,\" for He has had and has no likeness in what came before or after. This is originality in all respects. Blessed are they who know and blessed are they who attain.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about the friends in the Land of Ya, upon them be the Glory of God, this answer was sent down from the heaven of divine will:\n\nHe is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.\n\nO PEOPLE of Ya! Hearken unto the Voice of Him Who is the Lord of Names, Who calleth you from His Most Great Prison and inviteth you unto a station which God hath made sanctified above the descriptions of all peoples and purified from their allusions and references. He, verily, is the Omnipotent through Whom was hoisted the Standard of \"He doeth what He willeth\" and raised the Banner of \"He ordaineth what He pleaseth.\" Blessed is the strong one who hath voiced this Most Great Remembrance, and the soul that hath turned unto His Straight Path.\n\nWe have entered the Prison and called all unto God, the Lord of the worlds, in such wise that neither the hosts, nor the ranks, nor the fetters of the mighty and the princes, nor the clamor of the divines and the mystics have deterred Us. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto that which God hath desired, and woe unto the heedless. This is the Day wherein earthquakes have appeared, tribes have lamented, widows have cried out, and the skins of those who disputed the signs and proof of God and denied His manifest Book have quivered.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan, abandon that which ye possess. By God! The All-Merciful hath come with a proof before which all that the various peoples possess cannot stand. To this beareth witness the Lord of all men in this mighty Tablet. Say: The Wronged One guideth you for the sake of God and commandeth you that whereby the eyes of those who, upon hearing the Call, hastened unto the Supreme Horizon and answered their Lord, the All-Speaking, the All-Seeing, may be solaced. Beware lest the conditions of creation debar you from the Truth. Abandon that which people possess, through this Name through which every wise command hath been made manifest. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance. This is what ye have been commanded in successive years and in this Tablet which speaketh before the faces of the world that which the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken: \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Generous.\"\n\nWe have borne hardships and tribulations, both secretly and openly, for the exaltation of God's Cause. When it was exalted in truth, the buzzing of flies appeared from behind the veil, whereat every Prophet hath lamented and every trusted Messenger hath cried out. Say: O concourse of the Bayan! Be fair in the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest that which hindered the people of the Furqan prevent you from turning toward the Most Great Ocean, and lest that which veiled the nations veil you. Fear God and follow not every remote clamourer. Turn with supreme steadfastness toward the Supreme Horizon. By the life of God! This is better for you than all that hath been created in earth and heaven. To this testifieth the Lord of Names in this wondrous Tablet.\n\nHow many a servant hath been so attracted by the verses of his Lord that neither the might of princes nor the power of the strong could frighten him. They hastened through the wilderness of love and faithfulness, saying: \"Here am I, here am I, O Beloved of hearts! Here am I, here am I, O Thou Who art the Goal of all in the heavens and the earth!\" Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a grace from Him, that there might be revealed that which was hidden in God's treasury and inscribed in the Books of the Messengers.\n\nTake ye hold of the Book of God with the power granted you by Us and the might bestowed by your Lord. By the life of God! This is the Day We promised you aforetime that We would make you leaders in the earth and make you the inheritors. Hold fast, O servants of God, unto the Most Great Cord and cling to the hem of God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be hindered by the conditions of the world nor the doubts of the wayward. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the Book with the sun of the remembrance of your Lord, the One, the All-Informed.\n\nThe Supreme Pen calleth the friends in the land of Ya and its surroundings, mentioning them with most excellent remembrances, that perchance the choice wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful may so seize them that the intimations of the world \\[...\\]\n\nHe calls to all regions and makes mention with the most excellent utterances, that perchance the divine elixir of the All-Merciful's expression may so possess them that neither the intimations of the world nor the words of nations can prevent them. Fix your gaze upon this blessed, firm and goodly Word, which is as a torrential rain for the meadows of the All-Merciful's utterance, and drink thereof. You will not see or find the exalted Truth with the eyes of creation. Turn your eyes from all else that you may attain to His presence and meeting. This is a Day wherein the deeds, stations and ranks of all are and shall be made manifest, for the All-Knowing Distinguisher hath appeared and the All-Informed Expositor is evident and visible. Strive that ye may not be deprived of the endless bounties of the Munificent One, nor be forbidden what beseemeth this most holy and most exalted Day. The carpet of vain imaginings is spread wider than before, and the hosts of idle fancies are stronger than they were. May ye be assisted, through the grace of the All-Merciful, in that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth.\n\nPraise be to God that ye have attained to the Day of God and perceived the fragrance of the garment of reunion. Those who counted themselves the highest, greatest, most mighty and most exalted among mankind are deprived of the ocean of knowledge and veiled and forbidden from the horizon of God's Cause, while ye, through His preceding mercy and all-encompassing grace, have attained to that which hath ever been the hope of the sincere ones and those near unto God. Beseech ye God - exalted be His glory - in all conditions to assist you to preserve this precious pearl and to keep it concealed from the eyes of thieves and traitors. Verily, He speaketh the truth and guideth the way. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nGod willing, may all drink from the exalted words that have issued forth from the Source of the Cause - the Kawthar of attraction and yearning and the Salsabil of steadfastness and longing. For in truth, whosoever attaineth unto these will see all the world as non-existent and will stand firm on God's path with such steadfastness that those who stir up hatred and rancor in the world will find themselves powerless before his movement. By the life of the Beloved! Through the light of such souls doth the horizon of power and steadfastness shine forth resplendent. Consider the words of the cawer who hath written to his servant, taking two words from the Bayan and two from the Qur'an to compose verses which he sendeth abroad. Observe how foolish and stupid he considereth people to be, that he propoundeth such nonsense, and yet they regard him as possessing proof and evidence. By Thy life, O Beloved of my heart! This servant is greatly astonished at the people. What hath happened and what have they done to be afflicted with the guidance of one so ignorant? From the beginning of the world until now, such wondrous matters and exalted verses have never been seen, nor have the eye of utterance and the vision of understanding beheld their like. A single Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet cannot be equaled by all the books - all books bear witness to this, whosoever hath attained unto a drop from the ocean of fairness. The world hath been encompassed by wondrous and exalted verses, and manifest verses equivalent to all heavenly books have been revealed, and outwardly all that hath happened before \\[...\\]\n\nAnd outwardly, all that hath transpired in the past or shall come to pass in the future hath been set forth with utmost clarity in God's Holy Book. Nevertheless, they have uttered and continue to utter that which no heedless opponent hath ever said at the appearance of God's Manifestations. The shamelessness of this rebellious and transgressing band hath reached such heights that they speak these vain words at the appearance of the Manifestation and Messenger. May God grant justice and bestow the eye of grace.\n\nAmong the recent tidings is that Mirza Ahmad of the land of K and R, one night in the great city, after partaking of certain things, burned whatever writings against God he possessed and said he was pleased with this. In truth, he is observed to be like a chameleon. It is not known in which direction he intended or intends to go, toward which visage he turned or turneth. God, exalted be His glory, will either purify the hem of His Cause from such souls or, through His grace and favor, bestow upon them the choice wine of certitude and assurance. He is verily the Generous Giver.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Aqa Mirza 'AB, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], mentioning his expressions of love, and likewise your supplication for special favors from God, exalted be His glory - these matters were presented before His presence. This is what the Tongue of the Most Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance, exalted be His glory: \"The glances of God's favor are directed towards him. Praise be to God, they have attained to that which most of the earth's inhabitants are deprived. Some time ago, accompanied by Abu'l-Hasan, one Tablet specifically for you and another in his name were sent. God willing, they will attain unto them. We counsel him to wisdom and steadfastness. God willing, may they be assisted in these two mighty matters, and special favors will also be manifested from the heaven of bounty. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\" End.\n\nO My Supreme Pen! Make mention of those who have turned towards My Most Sublime Horizon, hearkened unto My sweetest call, held fast to My sure handle, clung to the hem of My luminous robe, and set their faces toward My countenance after the passing of all things, and soared in the atmosphere of the love of their Lord, the Lord of Names, and quaffed from crimson cups the wine of destiny. Blessed are ye for having attained unto the ultimate goal, the most exalted station, and the highest rank. Joy and felicitations be upon you, for the Beloved of the world and the Most Great Name makes mention of you in such wise that every sincere soul perceives therefrom the fragrance of the garment, and everyone endowed with smell inhales the scent of My Name, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\n\nI bear witness that ye have attained unto the recognition of God in days wherein all things and the Concourse on High have lamented by reason of what hath befallen them that have laid hold on the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him, and have spent that which they possessed in His straight Path. Rejoice ye in the Supreme Companion, inasmuch as the Lord of all creation maketh mention of you in this Prison which hath been designated by every name and is known as the Most Great Prison in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.\n\nYour blood was shed while mingled with the love of God, your spirits ascended while perfumed with the fragrances of His days, and your bodies were cast down while adorned with the ornament of martyrdom in this Cause, for which the near ones and the sincere have spent all they possessed. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in your remembrance and praise. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.\n\nThe light shining from the horizon of the heaven of the mercy of the All-Merciful be upon you, O ye manifestations of the names in the realm of creation and dawning-places of recognition amidst the peoples of all religions. Ye are they whom no hinderer could hinder, nor the derision of any idolator could deter. Ye heard and hastened until ye attained unto the station which was ordained by the Pen of God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Joy be unto you and blessed are ye and they who make mention of you and visit you, even as the Tongue of the Wronged One hath spoken while surrounded by sorrows from those who denied the right of God and His loved ones, and turned away from the Face when it shone forth from the horizon of revelation with manifest light.\n\nWe make mention of the Trustworthy One, whom We have mentioned in My Manifest Book. He hath outstripped most of creation in the service of God and His Cause, and hath attained unto such bounty as none save the All-Numbering, the All-Informed, can reckon. We were with him when his spirit ascended unto the Supreme Companion, and We gave him to drink of the pure wine time and again, and the mercy of his Lord encompassed him in such measure as all pens are powerless to recount. To this testifieth He Who speaketh and will continue to speak at all times: There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nO Trustworthy One! Thou art a letter from My crimson scroll and a mention from this Book which speaketh the truth and maketh mention of its loved ones in such wise that the Concourse on High and they who have prostrated themselves before the countenance of their Lord, the Possessor of this wondrous Day, visit them. Blessed is he who maketh mention of thee and draweth nigh through thee unto God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO Dove! O thou who gazest toward the Supreme Horizon and drinkest My sealed nectar from the white fingers of My bounty! We have made mention of those servants concerning whom thou didst beseech God for their remembrance and the manifestation of His favors and bounties unto them. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this great favor. Thou hast a station with thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. He shall assist thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and shall aid thee to make mention of Him in such wise as to attract hearts and minds. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nAs regards what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Mirza Muhammad Khan and Jinab-i-Mirza Muhammad-'Ali, this was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and two most mighty and most glorious Tablets specifically for them were revealed and sent down from the heaven of God's Will. God willing, may they attain unto them and be assisted in that which God desires. And concerning what was mentioned about Jinab-i-Sabz-'Ali and likewise about traveling to Zanjan and staying in that land for the purpose of teaching God's Cause - all these matters were presented. He, exalted be His glory, said: \"Most praiseworthy is journeying to that land, for most have no knowledge and are observed to be remote from the Cause. God willing, may you become the cause of enkindling through the fire of the love of the All-Merciful, and may you refresh the withered hearts of those who hesitate through the Kawthar of the remembrance of the All-Merciful. Convey to Jinab-i-Rasul, upon him be the Glory of God, greetings from this Wronged One adorned with the ornament of the Most Great Name. Say: By the life of God! Thou art mentioned before the Throne and thou art inscribed in My Clear Book. The gaze of the True One hath been and will ever be directed towards thee. Be thou steadfast in serving the Cause of thy Lord in all conditions. Soon will all thou seest perish, while that which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen shall endure throughout the duration of God's kingdom, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Adorn all the friends in that land with the ornament of the utterance of the Lord of Religions. How excellent is the heart that is set ablaze with His love and the tongue that speaketh His praise. Say: O friends of the All-Merciful! Strive that ye may each shine forth like unto the sun from the horizon of the heaven of steadfastness, in such wise that ye may regard those who associate partners with God, and whatsoever is with them and whosoever is with them, as mere handfuls of clay. This is the station of the most great steadfastness, the mention of which illumineth the horizons of the divine Tablets.\"\n\nO beloved of My heart! Some weak souls in the region of your honor and its surroundings are observed to be on the brink of a crumbling precipice, for they have heard that which was not worthy of hearing and have taken from those who were devoid of understanding. This is what hath been understood from the interpretation of the utterances of the Revealer of Verses, and is presented to your honor. God willing, through the arms of divine power and might, and the hands of God's omnipotence, and healing, sufficient utterances, they may turn from the left hand of conjecture to the right hand of certitude and drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness. Strange it is that people should inquire of the dim star concerning the rays and lights of the Sun. Say: O ye who possess sight! Turn ye unto the Sun itself and know it through its own self. In establishing Its Cause, It hath no need of any other than Itself. Its proof lies in Its verses, and Its existence in Its manifestation. Have they not heard these words, or have they not seen the Sun of bounty shining from the horizon of the heaven of Revelation, or have they not perceived the fragrances of Its utterances? In any case, in this Most Great Revelation all are commanded to behold Him with His own eyes and to know Him. Moreover, the entire world is a book establishing this mighty Cause, and all things, books, scriptures, psalms and tablets cry out with the most eloquent voice giving the glad-tidings of the Days of God. The Beloved Himself is astonished at these veiled ones and their utterances - indeed every person of insight is astonished. That which this servant has presented, if some of the friends \\[...\\]\n\nThe servant is perplexed by their utterances. That which this servant has submitted - should some of the friends and dignitaries consider it - would be most praiseworthy, that perchance it might free the servants from the darkness of suspicions and imaginings and illumine them with the dawn of God's Day. Should they reflect upon the grandeur mentioned in all the Books regarding this most exalted, most holy Cause, they would become aware. In one place He says: \"This is the Day wherein none shall be mentioned save God alone.\" False intimations from the past have prevented people from the essence of truth in this wondrous, exalted Day. In this connection, such utterances have been revealed from the Ancient Tongue that should attentive ears hearken unto them, they would surely become detached and freed from all that the people possess. His is the command and His the grandeur and the power, and He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.\n\nLast night several Tablets were revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge containing certain mentions which truly melted the soul and set the body aflame. This evanescent servant intended to send a copy thereof but found no opportunity, as there were many travelers present and each requested numerous Tablets from the heaven of oneness, and this evanescent servant was occupied with transcribing them. With a hundred thousand tongues I beseech Him to assist this evanescent one to fulfill this momentous task. Verily He is the Helper, the Mighty. The servant beseecheth his Lord not to withhold from His servants that which hath appeared in the Kingdom through His Most Great, Most Glorious Name.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about one of the friends having written a treatise - it was presented before His presence. This is what was revealed in response: Today whatever is written should be considered with the utmost care so that it may not become a cause of differences or give rise to objections from the people. What the friends of God utter today reaches the ears of all the peoples of the earth. In the Tablet of Wisdom these words were revealed: \"Verily the ears of the deniers are stretched toward Us that they might hear that whereby they can object to God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\" This matter is not without importance. Whatever is written should not be devoid of wisdom, and in the words the nature of milk should be concealed, that the children of the age might be nourished thereby and attain maturity. We have previously mentioned that one word is like unto springtime, causing the world of hearts to become fresh and verdant, while another is like unto poison, causing the blossoms and flowers to wither. God willing, the authors from among the friends of God should write that which fair-minded souls would accept and which would not give rise to objections from the people. End.\n\nRegarding the blessed verse of prohibition which was revealed in the Book of God and about which you inquired - it was presented before the Throne. He said: It would have been preferable and more beloved had it been mentioned to you verbally in His presence. Now it is not permitted to mention it in writing until its time comes. End.\n\nAnd likewise inquiry was made about this blessed verse, His words, exalted be His glory: \"When the ocean of reunion ebbeth\" up to His words, mighty be His glory: \"which hath branched from this mighty Stock.\" The divine purpose was the Most Great Branch of God and after Him the Most Mighty Branch of God - may my spirit and my being and my essence be offered up for the dust of their footsteps.\n\nConcerning your question about the Branches of God and His Afnan, it was submitted to the Most Holy Court, and He said: Until now, whenever mention of Afnan has been revealed from the Supreme Pen, it has referred to those souls who are related to the Primal Point, for in this Revelation We have summoned all to the highest horizon and guided them to the Most Great Ocean. In the early days, a special prayer was revealed for them, and in that prayer faith and recognition were ordained for them. God willing, may they act according to what God has willed and remain firm and steadfast in this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause. Blessed are they in that We have named them with this Name from which the fragrance of the All-Merciful has been diffused throughout creation. We have related them to this Tree as a grace from Us upon them. Ask God to protect them from the allusions of the people and the doubts of learning. We have favored some above others in a Book which none has understood save God, the Lord of the worlds. That which has been ordained for them from the presence of the All-Knowing Ordainer shall soon be made manifest. Those souls who are now related to the Tree are mentioned in the Book of Names as the kindred. If they act according to what God has willed, blessed are they in that they have turned and attained. They should beseech God to preserve them and assist them to remain steadfast in their present state. This is a Day wherein all souls must strive to attain the word of acceptance from the presence of the Lord of Names. By Branches are meant the existing Branches, but in the primary station there were and are the two Most Great Branches, and souls thereafter are counted as fruits and leaves. The Branches have no right to the property of others. And this blessed verse was mentioned, His exalted word: \"Refer ye whatsoever ye understand not from the Book to the Branch that hath branched from this mighty Stock.\" By Book is meant the Most Holy Book, and by the branched Branch is meant the Branch.\n\nConcerning fasting while traveling and the limit of travel, this question was asked: Let the limits of travel and traveler be explained - to what distance the term \"travel\" applies, and if during the journey one stays in a place for several days what is one's obligation, and on the day when a traveler intends to travel, for instance if one becomes a traveler at noon or after noon, what is one's obligation from morning until noon? The limits of travel have been fixed at nine hours in the Book of God - that is, from the place of departure to the intended destination should be nine hours, then the law of fasting is lifted. If a traveler stays in a place and it is determined that the stay will be for nineteen days, one must fast, and if it is less, fasting is not required. If during the month of fasting one arrives at a place and intends to stay there for one Bayanic month, one should refrain from fasting for three days and then fast for the remaining days. If one arrives in one's hometown, one should begin fasting that very day. On the day one intends to travel, fasting is not permitted.\n\nThis servant wishes to state that all the names mentioned in your letters, both past and present, which reached this servant, were presented at the Most Holy Court. He showed His grace and they were dispatched. One Most Great and Most Holy Tablet was also specifically revealed and sent for Jinab-i-Aqa Sabz-'Ali. God willing, he will attain to it. This servant's request is that you convey my greetings and praise, as befitting, to all. Strange and wondrous matters have emerged from the known island. In these days new tidings have arrived which cause embarrassment, and this servant is ashamed to mention them. We leave it to the True One, exalted be His glory. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Jinab-i-Aqa Sabz-'Ali, praise be to God, has rent asunder the veil and shattered the idol of fancy, and has drunk the water of certitude from the hand of the Spirit of Truth. God willing, may he ever attain to this most exalted station.\n\nAs commanded, convey God's greetings to the relatives of Jinab-i-Abu-Basir and Aqa Siyyid Ashraf, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, in the land of Za, and show the grace of God unto all, that all may be illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth and drink from the ocean of steadfastness. Verily He is the Protector of those who are nigh and the Protector of the sincere ones.\n\nJinab-i-Nazir, upon him be Baha'u'llah's grace, has arrived in these days and is residing in the vicinity. And regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Harf-i-Hayy, upon him be the glory of God, after attaining the honor of pilgrimage, as commanded and willed, he returned. Later he sought permission to stay in the great city, which was granted. After some time he ascended to the highest horizon. Blessed is he, for he is among those who attained what the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, had foretold, and was among the successful ones.\n\nAnd Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad-'Ali-Dih, upon him be Baha'u'llah's grace, has been gone for some time, and news of him has arrived from the City of God and other places.\n\nO beloved of my heart! The mention that was at the end of your letter, after the presentation of matters, was again presented at the threshold of the Throne. This response descended from the heaven of divine will, exalted be His glory: \"O Dove! O thou who gazest upon the face of thy Lord, the Most Glorious! We have heard that which thou didst commune with God at the end of thy letter. Blessed be thy face for having turned, and thy tongue for having spoken. Make mention of thy Lord amongst the servants, that the remembrance and utterance may draw them to the horizon of the All-Merciful and bring them nigh unto a station wherein the affairs of creation shall not prevent them from the Truth, nor shall the doubts of those who have disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, O thou who hast attained unto the choice wine through My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\"\n\nThe expression of praise, glorification, and greetings to the friends of the divine city and regions from this evanescent servant depends upon your grace. Glory be upon you, upon your relatives, and upon those who have remained faithful to God's Covenant on His mighty, wondrous Day. Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nThe Servant\n\nFirst of Sha'ban 1298\n\n=== END BH00057 ===\n\n=== START BH00058 ===\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the Heaven of Eternity unto His servants. Among them are those who soared unto the heaven of the Cause, and among them are those who tarried. Even thus have We sent down the Command as a mercy from Our presence unto Our believing servants. This is the Surih of the Sovereign which hath been sent down from the Heaven of the All-Merciful with verses mighty, impregnable, ancient. He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious. These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the Heaven of Eternity. God hath made them a testimony from Him and a proof from His presence unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, from this day until the Day when the standards of discord shall be obliterated and the Luminary of the horizons shall shine forth from the Dayspring of His Name, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Then shall the eyes of them that disbelieved and joined partners with God be dazzled, souls shall be perturbed, and such intoxication shall seize all who dwell in the kingdoms of Command and Creation that they shall place their fingers of bewilderment between their teeth. All that was and will be shall come to pass, and therein shall the inmost secrets of every soul be tested, if ye be of them that comprehend.\n\nSay: O people, fear ye God Who created you and sustained you and made you to be great ones in the earth, and sent down from heaven that which causeth the earth to yield holy and glorious fruits. Beware, O concourse of the earth, reject not the favor of God, and dispute not His Cause. Follow that which hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of the Cause, verses of wondrous might. O people, there hath come unto you relief from God your Lord, and He commandeth you to righteousness and piety, and forbiddeth you from all that leadeth you unto desire. Fear God and be of the God-fearing. Say: Verily your relief lieth in the establishment of this Beauty upon the throne of manifest glory, did ye but know. Say: He hath appeared in such wise as hath bewildered by His sovereignty all the worlds, yet ye have failed to recognize the relief that was promised you in all the Tablets, and ye remain of the heedless. Say: By God! Were ye to ponder the Cause of Him Who hath appeared in truth, ye would witness the relief of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in that which floweth from this Luminous, this Mighty, this Inaccessible Pen. Therefore, O people, examine your souls that ye may perchance recognize your Creator in these days wherein none among all created things hath known Him save whom your Lord, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, hath willed. Nay rather, the polytheists have risen against Him and dispute with Him concerning God's signs, and object to that which hath been revealed unto Him even as the followers of the Qur'an objected unto God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, when the clouds of grace were rent asunder and the Beauty of the Ancient of Days appeared from behind them in the name of 'Ali in truth with manifest signs. O people! By God! She whom I created with the hand of My will hath rebelled against Me even as Pharaoh rebelled before God, your Lord and the Lord of all creation, and said \"I am your Lord, the Most High,\" though he was powerless to create even a fly upon the earth, as every person of insight doth testify. And he whom I created by My word hath objected to Me in such wise as hath caused the heavens and earth to weep, and thereafter the eyes of those who circumambulated the sanctuary of grandeur with crimson tears, and behind them the eyes of the holy ones. Say: The Son of Mary ascended unto the mountain of the Cause, and the holy cloud enveloped Him. Then He witnessed drops of blood upon His garment and was bewildered within Himself, and asked concerning it, being among the questioners. Then the cloud informed Him of that which would befall the Youth. Thereupon He cried out within His soul and detached Himself from the world and all that is therein, and ascended unto the holy station before God, His Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of the worlds. And were I to utter a word concerning that which befell Him, verily the veil of the pavilion of grandeur would be rent asunder, and the pillars of the House would crumble, and the supports of the mighty throne would be shaken. But We have concealed it and been patient until God shall come with the authority of His triumph and make known His beauty between the heavens and the earths. Then know that when the polytheists witnessed the signs of God, they objected to them and denied that which they had believed in before, and thereby their deeds were rendered void, though they perceived it not and remained among the heedless. And for this reason all atoms curse them, and all that lieth behind the veils of power, while they sit in their seats sporting and remain among the joyous ones. Thus doth God reveal the secret thoughts of hearts and the treachery of those who profess faith with their tongues while denying Him by Whose command the measures of faith were ordained from the presence of One Mighty, Wise.\n\nThey deny Him by Whose command the measures of faith were ordained by One Who is Mighty, Wise. Among them is he who hath turned away and transgressed against his own self, and rebelled against God openly and was among the idolaters. And among them is he who sought to plot against God's Cause and thereby instill hatred for the Youth in the hearts of them that believed, that he might cause them to slip from the Path and distance them from the holy and luminous Shore. Thus did they gather together according to what Satan whispered in their hearts, and they plotted a plot. But God shall soon make manifest their plot to whoso followeth the command of his Lord and is endowed with insight from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. And among them is he who felt assured that if he opposed the Youth, those who followed him in his hatred would oppose Him too, for he perceiveth leadership within himself. Say: Woe unto you, O company of deniers! God hath servants whom neither signs nor allusions can hinder, whom no hinderer can obstruct nor rejecter's rejection deter, even should all creation combine against them. These are they whom the signs of the past concerning the mention of the Resurrection did not hinder, nor were they prevented by what was revealed in the Qur'an - \"but He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.\" They rent asunder those veils through Our power's sovereignty and entered the holy sanctuary, the seat of their Lord, the Most High, with manifest sincerity. They acknowledged within themselves that prophethood shall never cease from this time unto an end that hath no end. Thus did the Spirit breathe into their hearts the spirit of certitude from One Who is Mighty, Beautiful. These know God through God and through what appeareth from Him, and they stop their holy ears from the cawing of the idolaters, even if they be among the great ones of the people and their nobles, for their nobility lieth in following their Creator's command and prostrating before God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nSay: O people, fear God and dispute not about God's verses, nor refute the truth with what ye possess. Be ashamed before Him Who created you through His word. Fear God, O people, and be not among the wrongdoers. And if ye believe not in Him Who hath come to you from the Spirit's dawning place with verses that prove what ye possess, do not fabricate lies against Him and be not among the fabricators. O people of the Bayan! By God, this is indeed the Truth and He reciteth unto you God's verses. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and be among the fair-minded. If ye object to what is now revealed unto you, by what proof can your souls find rest and be among the tranquil? Say: No one's faith or deeds shall be accepted today except through following this decisive, mighty, and wise Cause. And if ye believe not, God shall soon raise up a people and cause them to hear the melodies of the Cause and enter this Paradise which God hath made the sign of His grandeur between the heavens and earths. These shall know their Creator through His own Self and through what hath been sent down from Him of the verses of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Luminous. They shall leave behind all that the people possess, even if it be the books of the first and the last ones. Verily, they who have recognized the ocean's sovereignty, its depths and its pearls - would they turn to mere waves? Nay, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious, if ye be among those who know. And he who hath drunk from the holy Kawthar from the hand of the celestial youths - would he be content with brackish water? Nay, by your Lord, the Most Merciful, if ye be among the certain. And whoso hath known the Sun shall not occupy himself with its shadows. Thus do We cast upon your hearts that which shall draw you near unto God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, that perchance the people of insight might ascend above the dust.\n\nWhoso hath recognized the Sun will never occupy himself with the shadow. Thus do We cast upon your hearts that which will draw you nigh unto God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, that perchance they who possess understanding may ascend from the dust and soar into the heaven of righteousness, the seat of mighty glory. When thou reachest thy land, the city which hath been named after My sovereign Name, give thou glad-tidings unto it and unto them that have believed in that which the Holy Pen hath inscribed through the finger of God, that ye may be of them that rejoice. Say: O people! Ye were asleep upon the couches of tranquility while the Temple of the Cause was crying out and lamenting. O people! Aid ye God and His Cause in these days, and hesitate not in aught, but be ye of them that help. His help consisteth in teaching His Cause among His servants and in remaining steadfast in His love in these days wherein the pillars of the knowing ones have trembled. O people! Exchange not the favor of God amongst you, nor deny that whereby your faith in God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, may be established. Fear ye God, O people, and cast not the Cause of God behind your backs, nor follow the footsteps of the evil ones. O people! If ye deny the Sovereign of the Cause, to what countenance will ye turn in these days when the dust of fire hath enveloped most of the servants, and intoxication hath seized the dwellers of the heavens and of the earth, save them that have detached themselves from all things and have clung to the cord of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nO Most Great Spirit! Make mention in the Book of Abu'l-Qasim who journeyed unto God and was touched on the way by the hardships of exile, that he may rejoice within himself and stand firm in the Cause of his Lord at a time when the feet of every discerning knower have slipped. O servant! Grieve not over anything, and turn not unto them that have disbelieved and turned away and were in manifest heedlessness. Be patient in what hath befallen thee, then put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and the Lord of all things, and the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO Faraj! If thou passest not by thy home, send thou this Tablet unto Our near servants. We have made this Tablet the garment of the Cause that the fragrance of the Youth may waft therefrom upon all created things, that perchance God may raise up thereby a people who will behold naught save God, their Lord, and whom the allusions of the deniers will not hinder, that perchance Our servant Abraham may detect from this garment the sweet savors of holiness and arise to promote the Cause between the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Abraham! Step forth from behind the veil of silence through My Name, the Speaker, the Articulate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Friend! Sanctify thyself from all allusions, then raise thy call of the Spirit between earth and heaven, that perchance thereby the fire may be kindled in the breasts of the righteous, and they may arise to serve the Cause with a sovereignty from Us and a command from Our presence. Verily, I am the Powerful over what I will, and I am the Giver, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nArise to serve God and aid His Cause, and fear thou no one. This is God's command unto thee, decreed by the Pen of might and glory. Say: Today nothing shall profit anyone, though he should bring all the scriptures of heaven and earth, except that he enter beneath the shadow of his Lord, the Most High, in this His latter Manifestation. By God! This is His Beauty in truth, His Manifestation in the kingdom of command and creation, and His sovereignty amongst all created things.\n\nSay: O people! Do ye write of the Bayan while denying Him Who revealed it? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! Do ye make mention of God and then seek to slay His Self? Alas for you, O company of polytheists! Say: He hath appeared in these days in such wise that all necks have been humbled before Him, if ye be of them that know. The Cause of God hath been manifested through His own Self alone, as ye have heard and were among the hearers. Say: By God! The Cause hath shone forth like the sun at high noon, and none shall deny it save every blind and accursed one.\n\nO Friend! Strip thyself of the allusions of the people, then adorn thy temple with the raiment of glory resplendent, for We have made thee the herald of Our Cause in that land, that thou mayest convey unto the people that which the Spirit hath inspired in thee from Our presence, and that thou mayest be engaged in a wondrous remembrance. By My Beauty! He in whose heart there remaineth love for aught created between heaven and earth shall never be able to bear this firm, mighty, and exalted Cause. Purify thyself with this choice wine that floweth from the ancient spring, then purify therewith the hearts of the seekers.\n\nTherefore, rejoice within thyself that We have named thee the herald of the Cause. Then pass round the crimson wine in My Most Glorious Name between earth and heaven, that thereby may be quickened the spirits of those who, when the verses of their Lord, the Most High, are recited unto them, fall prostrate upon their faces in the dust, submissive before God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nKnow thou that whatsoever thou hast heard concerning this Cause hath appeared by My command, and all else was created by My word, and none is aware of this save My Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. When We desired to exalt the Cause among the peoples of old, We made reference in Our utterances to others besides Ourself, as a wisdom from Us, for We were the Ruler. We raised the Cause to such a station that ye heard of its spread and exaltation until the Word and mention thereof filled the heavens and earth. But when the Cause appeared and emerged, then shone forth and dawned, there rose against Me those servants who were created by My command, and thus were they among the transgressors.\n\nO Herald of the Cause! Those who veiled their faces behind masks out of fear for themselves, when the breezes of assurance wafted forth, emerged like serpents. Thus do We recount unto thee that which was hidden from the eyes of the beholders, that thou mayest be apprised of what hath befallen My Beauty and be among the knowers. Blessed art thou, O Herald of the Cause, in that thou didst attain the presence of the Throne at the time when the Sun of the horizons dawned forth from the region of Iraq. By God! Thereby hast thou attained to that which none else hath attained.\n\nHappy art thou, O Herald of the Cause, in that thou hast attained the presence of the Throne at an hour when the Sun of the horizons shone forth from the direction of Iraq. By God, thou hast thereby achieved that which none else hath achieved, and this is a revelation from One mighty, all-knowing. Give thanks unto God for having blessed thee with His presence and aided thee to visit the Manifestation of His Self in days which no servant recognized, being seized with vain imaginings and in manifest heedlessness. Know thou that Satan will come to you from the direction of tyranny with that which would hold you back from the Beauty of the All-Merciful. Then arise in the Cause, cast aside what he holdeth, turn away from him, and turn thy face toward My luminous and mighty and radiant countenance. Say: O Satan, remove thyself from among the concourse of the Spirit, for We have found from thee the stench of hatred from God, the Mighty, the Generous. O thou accursed one, thou bearest that whereby all who are in the heavens and earth curse thee, and the dwellers of the kingdom of Command and Creation, and all that was and will be, yet thou wast heedless of this and wast among the negligent. By God, thou hast passed by nothing except that it cursed thee with its inner tongue, but since thou wast deaf thou heardst not its call and wast among the ignorant. Thus do We relate unto thee tidings of the unseen that ye may be convinced that with Us is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and knowledge of all things in preserved and mighty tablets.\n\nO Tongue of Eternity! Make mention of Husayn in the Book and give him glad tidings of the lights of the Throne, that it may turn him to the direction of eternity, the perspective of his Lord, the Most High, and draw him nigh unto the shore of Paradise, the station wherein the fire was kindled from the Divine Lote-Tree, proclaiming that there is no God but I, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful. O servant! How long wilt thou be slothful regarding thyself? Therefore, be thou ignited by this fire, then call out among the righteous with that which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful, hath taught thee. Beware lest ye differ among yourselves or cast the Cause of God behind your backs. Be among the people like the rays of the sun, such that your faces may illumine those in all the worlds. By God, O servant, wert thou to learn of the tribulations that have befallen Me, thou wouldst weep and lament throughout thy life, and this is a manifest truth. However, We have veiled the matter lest sorrows encompass the Manifestations of the All-Merciful and consume the hearts of those near unto God. Therefore have We been patient and concealed the matter lest the veil be rent asunder from before the face of all peoples.\n\nO Herald of the Cause! Make mention of Our servant who hath been named with the first letter of My Name, that he may give thanks in his soul and be of them that are thankful. Say: O son! Give thanks unto God that thy father was martyred in His path and became of the martyrs. By the True One! When his spirit ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, he was received by the denizens of the Supreme Concourse with vessels of sanctity and chalices filled with the choice wine of paradise, and the hosts of Our most exalted realm were blessed by his presence. Were We to lift the veil from the eyes of men so they might witness his station in the most glorious paradise, they would sacrifice their souls to attain his lofty, resplendent and glorious station. Then would the maidens of paradise vie with each other to serve him, for he is seated at the right hand of paradise, upon his head the crown of immortality from My Most Great and Most Glorious Name. Thus did the grace of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful, encompass him. O son! Deprive not thyself of thy portion, for thou hast a station with thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Walk, then, in the footsteps of thy father and follow his guidance, for were his limbs to be severed, none would find aught therein save My love, as ye have witnessed and were of them that bear witness. Thus have We informed thee of that which is hidden from the hearts of men, that thou mayest be steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and be of them that are firmly rooted.\n\nMake mention, then, of him who was named Muhammad-'Ali and give him glad tidings from Us of how God hath remembered him in the Tablet, and his name hath flowed from the finger of holiness - a bounty that no other bounty can equal, whether of them that are gone before or them that shall come after. Whosoever attaineth unto this hath attained unto all good from his Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. O servant! Grieve not over the world and its hardships, for whatsoever is decreed for the servants in the scrolls of destiny, even though it be adversity, is better for them, if ye be of them that understand. For God hath concealed the consequences of matters from the sight of men, and there is no God but Him. He ordaineth what He pleaseth and doeth what He willeth. How often through hardship doth the servant reach the fountain of ease, and how often through ease doth hardship overtake him, if ye be of them that witness. For example, hadst thou remained in the station of authority and power that thy grandfather enjoyed, perchance leadership would have prevented thee from guidance. Thus doth the Beauty of the Divine Unity cast thee that thou mayest be, in all conditions, in surpassing joy and wondrous delight. Give thanks, then, unto God for having taken from thee that which would have veiled thee from His recognition, for what profiteth the servant is this, and naught else will profit him though he should possess the treasures of the heavens and earth in precious rubies or radiant pearls of sanctity. By God! That which enricheth the servants in these days is the recognition of their Lord and then the love of the Youth, and without these twain neither fatteneth nor enricheth, though they should possess the treasures of the heavens and the earth. Thus doth the Pen of Command counsel thee that thou mayest be steadfast in My love to such extent that nothing shall disturb thee, though thou be struck with the swords of sharpened steel. Beware! Arise to serve God with such steadfastness that though all who are in the heavens and earth should rise against thee, thy feet would not slip from the path of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By God! Should anyone in these days arise in My love, though all on earth should contend with him, God would assuredly make him victorious over them, for the spirit of power hath wafted from the direction of might upon them that are sincere in faith. Then convey the Command of thy Lord with spirit and fragrance in such wise that no mischief be stirred up in the land, for it would recoil upon the root of the Tree, if ye be of them that understand.\n\nThen remind Jacob with wondrous remembrances from his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: The sight of Jacob was restored by the fragrance of the garment of Joseph, the Mighty, and he was among those who saw. We have sent thee the garment of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in the form of a Tablet that thou mayest find therefrom the fragrances of holiness and that the eyes of thy heart may be solaced, whereby thou shalt witness the lights of a mighty throne and be established in the love of thy Lord in days wherein the very essence of tranquility and composure is shaken, the mountains of vain imaginings are leveled, and the veil of the deluded is rent asunder. Then shalt thou find the Concourse of the Bayan intoxicated by the Command, the scourges of the Command taking hold of them from all directions while they rejoice within themselves and remain among the heedless. Therefore, pay no attention to them but flee unto God Who created you and fashioned you, then take your seat on the right hand side in a secure and honored place. O My loved ones! Adorn your bodies with the raiment of courtesy and justice, and do not commit that which your minds and your pleasure would abhor. Fear God and be among the God-fearing. And thou, O Jacob, if thou wouldst behold with the eye of the heart the garment of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, thou wouldst find it reddened with the blood of hatred by reason of what the arrows of the wicked have wrought against it, and God beareth witness that ye are among the heedless concerning this.\n\nThen We sent Our mercy from the direction of eternity to him who was named Rahmatullah that he might be merciful unto himself and be of the merciful ones. Verily, his mercy toward himself is the recognition of his Lord, and this is the foundation of mercy. Have ye seen anything more excellent than this? Nay, by the Self of Baha, were ye of those who are certain! O servant! Prevent not the wafting of thy Lord's mercy upon thyself, nor the breezes of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, from thine own being. Cast behind thee every mention, then hold fast to the mention of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Knowing. And if harm touch thee, grieve not but reflect upon My harm and say as I say: \"O Lord! Harm hath touched me, and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.\" And if distress befall thee, be patient and say as I say: \"O Lord! Pour forth upon me patience, for Thou art the best of helpers.\" And if decree afflict thee, show forth patience and say: \"O Lord! Send down upon me mercy, for Thou art the best of those who send down.\"\n\nO Ancient Beauty! Shine forth from the direction of eternity with the effulgence of Thy Most Glorious Name upon him who was named Muhammad in the kingdom of names, that he may be attracted within himself by what hath seized him of the revelation of the Cause from the direction of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. O servant! Were there to be a thousand souls within thee and thou wert to sacrifice them all because thy name hath flowed from the Pen of God, it would still be more insignificant than anything else in the face of this mighty grace. And if thou wouldst sharpen thy vision, thou wouldst witness that nothing whatsoever created between the heavens and the earth can equal it. Beware lest thou forget the grace of thy Lord or become one of the doubters in thy Lord's religion. Be steadfast in the Cause, then stand firm and be not disturbed by the cawing of the polytheists. Soon shall the clamor of the Samaritan and then the cry of the Calf be raised among the worlds. Thus do We inform you of the truth that ye may become aware of what shall appear among the people and that the breezes of the polytheists may not veil you.\n\nThen another splendour shineth upon him who was named Ismail, that he may be refreshed by the breezes of his Lord and be among those who rejoice. O Dhabih! Guard thyself from all that thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, abhorreth. Turn not to the world and its ornaments and what hath been ordained therein, for they shall profit thee nothing. Rather, what profiteth thee is that which hath been ordained for thee on tablets of sublime glory. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of the sacred sanctuary, or thy soul of the Ka'bah of intimacy, or thy tongue of the remembrance of God, the Prevailer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O servant! Weep thou for the Self of God and His loneliness, then for His tribulations and estrangement in this land wherefrom have been cut off the feet of those who seek Him. Say: O people! Have mercy upon Him Who aided you when ye were in abasement and manifest fear, Who stood alone amidst the enemies and helped you with the hosts of the unseen. Thus was His help ever nigh unto the believers. Beware, O people, lest, having found contentment in yourselves, ye transgress your bounds and contend with your Lord, the All-Merciful, and dispute that which hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of a great Name. O people! Refute not the truth by what ye possess. By God! All that whereby ye seek to prove otherwise hath proceeded from My tongue and flowed from My All-Knowing, All-Wise Pen. Beware lest ye reproach Me for this, for verily the Most Great Spirit speaketh within My breast and the Spirit of Eternity moveth the Pen of Baha as He pleaseth. This is from Him, nay rather, from One All-Knowing, All-Informed. By God! Were the matter in My hands, I would have veiled My face from all who are on earth and would have departed from among these people and dwelt upon a mountain where none of My loved ones would remember Me, much less these heedless ones. By God! Whenever I desire to remain silent concerning wondrous remembrances, the Spirit of Remembrance speaketh within My members, raiseth Me up to His Cause, and strengtheneth Me at all times.\n\nO My brother! Thou hast slandered Me, exerting all the power thou didst possess, after I had nurtured thee with Mine own hands and shielded thee from the harm of all peoples. How many were the nights when thou didst rest peacefully in thy bed while I kept watch around thy house as thy protector! How many were the days when thou didst live in comfort with thy wives while I stood before the presence of the oppressors, lest harm touch thee or aught befall thee that would grieve thee! Yet despite all this, thou didst secretly conspire against Me, seeking to find an opportunity to act in ways that would shake the pillars of a mighty throne. We would send to distant lands to bring before thee what would gladden thy soul and bring joy to thy being. Yet at every moment thou didst seek to harm Me, such that if thou hadst found someone to confide in, thou wouldst have kindled a fire that would have consumed the hearts of all peoples. By God! I was aware of all this, yet after knowing what thou wert about, We concealed it - thus is thy Lord All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. By God! What flowed from thy pen regarding morals hath caused the faces of glory to fall upon the earth's dust, rent asunder the veil of grandeur in the Ridvan of eternity, and convulsed the hearts of those near unto God. When thou didst travel with Me on this journey which caused tears to flow down the radiant cheeks of the dwellers in the chambers of glory - despite all thou didst ask of Me and seek My permission for, I spoke not a word, for I perceived in thee what none else in the world had perceived. When thou didst travel and enter this land, thou didst rise against Me every day, nay every hour. By God! No spot remained on My body that was not struck by the arrows of thy schemes. If thou shouldst deny this, the Tongue of God, the Knowing, the All-Informed, would bear witness. Until thou didst slander Me without proof or clear authority. When these emigrants learned of this, their cries and lamentations were raised, while thou didst remain in thy house in great comfort and delight. When We witnessed thy deed and what flowed from thy pen, We departed from among you alone, with no helper or supporter, such that there was none to serve Me or prepare food for these children as ordained for them from the Kingdom of their Lord, the Giving, the Bountiful, the Merciful. Yet even after this thou didst not rest, but spread throughout the land thy deeds in My name to plant hatred in the hearts of the lovers. From thy tongue and pen came forth what the Pen of the Most High would be ashamed to recount. Hear then what was revealed before: \"If thou shouldst stretch forth thy hand to slay Me, I would not stretch forth My hand to slay thee\" - and God is witness to what I say. O My brother! By God, thou and those with thee shall perish and return to dust, while sovereignty shall remain with God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. By God, O My brother! I harbor no hatred in My heart for thee or for any created thing. Therefore hear My words, purify thyself, and be not of the heedless. Even if thou shouldst remain as thou art, and all in the heavens and earth should bow down before thee, it would profit thee nothing. Nay, by My Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!\n\nBy My All-Knowing, All-Wise Self! If all created beings were to hate Me, would this benefit thee in any way? Nay, by thy Lord, the Protector, the Mighty, the Ancient of Days! Then would My Pen lament, and Mine eyes, and all things, if thou be of them that perceive. Cast behind thee the world and its adornments, and let not leadership beguile thee from the remembrance of thy Lord and from showing humility before God's God-fearing servants. Yet with all this thou wast not content until thou didst write to the chief of the city with such abasement as caused My dignity to be compromised before all creation. Then thou didst ally thyself with him who hateth thee and who thou hatest, and with thine own ears didst hear that of which thou didst complain before My face, and wast among the complainers. When he arose to oppose Me and the fire of malice blazed within his heart, thou didst take him as thy helper, and thus wast thou among the doers thereof. Soon shall be made manifest to thee what lieth within his heart, for God hath decreed that He shall reveal it in truth, and He, verily, doeth what He willeth. By God, O My brother! If thou wouldst be fair, thou wouldst weep over thyself, then over Me, and would lament throughout thy days and be among those who repent unto God Who created thee by His command. There is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all things are preserved with Him in sacred and glorious tablets. Consider the beginning of time: did he who slew his elder brother, who was named Abel, remain upon the earth? Nay, by God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Wise! Rather, he returned to dust, then God raised him up in truth and questioned him concerning his deed, then returned him to his abode. Thus consider this matter, then ponder upon it and be of them that reflect. Beware lest thou be veiled from what We have bestowed upon thee from the Kingdom of Names, for verily it was created by Our command, and We were ever the Commander of all things.\n\nO Most Great Beauty! Move the Pen in remembrance of Thy Lord, then purify it from the remembrance of all else. Beware lest thou occupy thyself with anyone; rather, be engaged in the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Then behold him who standeth before the Cause with the glances of thy glorious and merciful favor, the Mighty, the Protecting, the All-Encompassing - he who was named Ali after Sha'ban - that he may arise from his slumber and be of those who remember. Say: O servant! The Tree of Remembrance hath been raised up in this wise Remembrance, and the leaves, suspended and stirring upon its branches, do proclaim that there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Peerless, and that this is the Splendor of God between the heavens and the earth, and His Light in the dominion of Command and Creation, and His sovereignty over what hath been and what shall be, were ye of those who know. Through Him hath shone forth the Sun of Glory and Majesty, and the faces of those near unto God have been illumined. Were it not for Him, nothing would have appeared in creation, nor would the Spirit have spoken upon the branch of eternity that there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. O servant! Adorn thyself with My attributes, then walk in My path, and this is a bounty whereunto no bounty in the worlds can compare. Then adorn thy tongue with truthfulness and thy temple with the robe of justice, if thou be of those who act. Thus doth the One mighty in power teach thee from the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Then adorn the temple of the Friend with the robe of thy Lord's remembrance, the Glorious, that he may shatter the idols of desire through My supreme and most exalted sovereignty and be of the steadfast in the days wherein the souls of those who are established upon the thrones of names shall be shaken, and every possessor of authority shall set aside his authority, and thou shalt see people intoxicated from the thunderbolt of the Cause. Thus do We cast upon thee from the holy verses that thou mayest be of those who know. Be steadfast, O servant, in the love of God and the Manifestation of His Self, and this is the foundation of religion, if thou be of those who act. Abandon self and desire, then soar with the wings of holiness in this atmosphere which hath encompassed all the worlds. Beware lest thy tongue be veiled by the veil of falsehood, for this verily abaseth man among all created things. Say: O people! Fulfill that which ye have covenanted and deprive not the poor of what ye possess, for by this the good is withheld from the cloud of exalted bounty. Then follow what hath been ordained for you in the Book and be more active in deeds than in words. By God! This is My way and the way of the sanctified ones. Say: O people! The glances of God have turned toward you, yet ye turn not your sight to Him; thus are ye in grievous heedlessness. The face of God hath shone forth above your heads - beware lest ye withhold your eyes from gazing upon it, for this is a bounty that was great before the Throne. The Kingdom of God hath arisen before your faces - beware lest ye deprive yourselves of its shade and be not of the heedless. Thus doth the Sovereign of the Cause command you with that which is better for you than whatsoever hath been created in the worlds.\n\nO Herald of the Cause! Command him who hath been named Rida to turn the mirror of his heart unto the Most Sublime Vision of God, this Most Pure and Most Manifest Station, and to be of them that are assured. Say: O servant! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through Our power, then enter the Law of certitude. Know ye that all peoples have been veiled by the veil of fancy from time immemorial. When We desired to rend them asunder, We sent forth a Manifestation from among the Manifestations of Our Self to tear away the veils of creation through the power of the All-Merciful. Thereupon arose a great outcry between the heavens and the earth, and the souls of the idolaters were struck with terror, until God established the truth through His signs and made vain the deeds of them that were veiled from the beauty of the Cause and were among the heedless. Though naught existed between them save fancy, its rending proved grievous unto them and they were among them that cried out. In those days We raised up all fancies in human form and adorned them with the garment of one of Our names; then We made their mention renowned amongst men, for thus were We wont to act. But when he waxed proud before God, his Lord, and contended and disputed with Him, We stripped from him the garment of names and caused him to appear as a handful of clay. Blessed, therefore, be he who rendeth asunder this Most Great Veil, the like of which hath not appeared in the dominion of the worlds. Glad tidings, then, to him whom the pride of fancy hath not veiled and who rendeth it asunder with the fingers of divine power from One mighty and powerful. Joy be unto him whom the veils of glory prevent not from entering beneath the shadow of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and who is of them that have cast behind their backs all that would veil them from the remembrance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.\n\nO Most Ancient Pen in the Most Great Dominion! Move, by thy Lord's leave, to make mention of him who hath been named 'Ali-Qabli-Khan, that the breezes of the All-Merciful may draw him to this Garden whose leaves proclaim that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Just, the Peerless, the All-Wise. Hearken unto that which the Most Great Spirit singeth in the Ancient Dominion, that thy soul may find rest thereby and thou mayest be of them whom the joy of the Cause hath seized from every direction and who are among the gladdened ones. O people! Be as lights of the countenance among the servants and as manifestations of the Cause throughout all lands, that through you may appear the tokens of God amidst His creatures and His power amongst all created things. Beware! Adorn yourselves with the virtues of God and His Cause, and be distinguished from all others. Then will your relation to your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, be truthfully established. Otherwise, the designation of existence would not be true of any soul, how much less this most exalted and sublime station. Thus doth the Pen of Counsel counsel you from One mighty and bountiful.\n\nO Herald! Call out from Our presence unto Our servant Sulayman and give him the glad tidings of the Spirit of the All-Merciful, that he may be of those who rejoice. O Sulayman! Guard thyself from the manifestations of Satan, then build the Most Holy Mosque with pillars of love from this Most Glorious Youth, then raise it with hands of detachment, then adorn it with the gold of remembrance in celebration of this Beauty through Whom the banner of majesty was raised in the heaven of independence, whereupon there befell Him that which caused the eyes of the ancients and the modern ones to weep. O people! Enter the Most Holy Mosque which God hath built with hands of grace in your hearts. Beware lest ye destroy it through the hosts of self and passion. Then preserve it from the mention of satans. Say: By God! I am verily the Most Holy Mosque in the Concourse on High, and the Much-frequented Fane in the Realm of Revelation, and the Sacred Sanctuary at the Divine Lote-Tree, and the Decree hath been fulfilled at the Holy Place of permanence, and the Station of Holiness in this lofty and impregnable Paradise. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and destroy not His House of Command with hands of hatred, and demolish not its pillars through the promptings of self and passion. Fear God Who created you through the Manifestation of His Self and sent unto you that whereby the eyes of eternity were consoled by His beauty. Yet ye remain dead within the veils of your selves. O people! Break not God's Covenant, cast not His Testament behind your backs, and be not of those who mock His signs, even as those servants mocked in those days - they whose realities were created by a stroke of His Pen, and thus were they among the transgressors.\n\nThen make mention in the Book of Mahdi, that he may be guided by the guidance of God, his Lord, and be of those who are guided. O Mahdi! Take God's guidance with power from Us and cast behind thy back the guidance of those who mention God with their tongues while opposing His Self and warring against His Being, yet perceive it not. When anyone enters their presence, they sit cross-legged, then extend their fingertips from their sleeves and move their tongues with dignity in remembrance of thy Chosen Lord. This they do outwardly, while inwardly they pronounce judgment against God to preserve their leadership, caring not in the least. Say: By God, the Truth! Even if ye should remember God to the extent that your tongues are severed, and worship Him until your backs are bent, it shall profit you not except through My love. Thus hath the decree been sent down from the heaven of mighty glory. Would it profit those who were given the Furqan if they were to worship God with the worship of both worlds? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Likewise observe today the people of the Bayan, if ye be of those who understand. Thus hath the Finger of Power rent asunder the veil of concealment, and truth is revealed, and the Spirit speaketh with pure truth between the heavens and earth, that perchance people may know their Creator and not be veiled from the remembrance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, by that which passeth between the servants.\n\nThen the Pen of Command desired to make mention of the Messenger in the Tablet, that his deed might conform to his name and he might be of those who act. O Messenger! Deliver the messages of thy Lord first unto thyself, then deliver them unto the people, that thy words might influence the hearts of those who seek. Then send unto the servants what We have sent unto thee from the direction of the All-Merciful - the sweet fragrances of glorification - that perchance they may be drawn to the Throne of Good-Pleasure, this hallowed, luminous Station. Say: O people! Hearken unto the Word of God, then recite it in your days. God hath ordained for its reciter the good of this world and the next, and will raise him in Paradise with such beauty as shall illumine all who dwell in the worlds. Blessed then is he who readeth the verses of his Lord, pondereth their mysteries, and discovereth the pearls of knowledge treasured within them by a vigilant Preserver.\n\nThen remind him who visited the Ancient House, that he may rejoice in what hath been revealed of God's traces in this firm, decisive and impregnable Tablet. Say: By God! We have raised the Sanctuary upon the Temple of Grandeur, in the form of Glory, in the image of a Youth in these days. Blessed be God, the best of creators! And whoso circleth round it, verily the denizens of the highest Paradise and the temples of them that glorify God circle round him. Yet God hath accepted from His loved ones that which they missed, as a grace from His presence, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Ere long shall the hosts of God's sovereignty descend therein, and they shall assuredly aid His Cause, exalt His remembrance, and recite His verses at dawn and at eventide.\n\nO Harbinger of the Cause! Make mention from Us to those servants whose names the Pen of God hath not moved to inscribe, that the fragrances of remembrance may seize them from the presence of One forgiving, merciful. Say: We have recorded your names in the holy Tablets that lay concealed behind the veils of the Cause and hidden in the treasuries of your Lord's protection, the Ruler, the All-Wise. Let the loved ones of God unite in His Cause in such wise that naught may arise to divide them, and may they be as one soul. Thus have We commanded thee and them, that ye may be among the doers.\n\nThen make mention of the handmaidens of God who have believed in God their Creator, and those who have been afflicted with tribulations. Say: Be patient and grieve not thereby, for God hath ordained for you and for those who have been martyred in His path what no mind can comprehend. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon you, O hosts of God in all lands, if ye be steadfast in the Cause of your Lord.\n\n=== END BH00058 ===\n\n=== START BH00059 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High!\n\nPraise, sanctified above the mention of servant and the remembrance of all created things, beseemeth the most holy and most glorious court of the Desired One Who hath caused His loved ones to speak His praise and enabled them to celebrate His remembrance. The doubts of the divines produced no effect, and the might of the powerful and the ascendancy of rulers created neither weakness nor impediment. They willingly bore the chains of tyranny for His love's sake, and in their eyes the taunts of enemies and the torments of the wicked appeared as praise. Exalted, exalted be their station! Exalted, exalted be their remembrance! Exalted, exalted be their power and their steadfastness and their constancy! In truth, every praise returneth to this station, for God, exalted be His glory, is sanctified above all descriptions and remembrances. This matter is proven through clear evidence. Despite my knowledge and certitude of the sanctification and transcendence of that holy Being above all praise and glorification and remembrance of the world, I wish with a hundred thousand thousand tongues at every moment to praise Him saying \"Unto Him be praise, O God of the worlds\" and to make mention of Him, for He hath crowned His Name and His loved ones with the crown of patience and adorned them with the raiment of forbearance. In the place of lamentation, smiles appeared; in the station of complaint, thanksgiving shone forth; and at the time of sorrow, joy was manifest. Glorified be the All-Powerful, and glorified be the Patient One!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things and in Whose right hand is the control of both the seen and the unseen! I beseech Thee by Him Who conversed with the Burning Bush, and by the Hands of Thy Cause, and the manifestations of Thy grace, and the dawning-places of Thy most beautiful names and Thy most exalted attributes, to strengthen the Dayspring of steadfastness and the Source of Thy remembrance, O Lord of all creation, even more than Thou hast strengthened him in all conditions. The servant beareth witness before Thy face to Thy Name that hath borne hardships for Thy love and the derision of enemies for Thy name and remembrance, until he entered prison, ignited by the fire of Thy Cause. There hath appeared from him that which befitteth Thy days. O my Lord! Aid him, then, with the hosts of the unseen and the visible realm. Nay, by Thy Self! Rather aid him with the hosts of Thy remembrance and Thy utterance. By Thy glory! Truly tribulations and trials in Thy path are the ultimate desire of those near unto Thee among Thy loved ones and the sincere ones among Thy chosen ones. However, since the servant desireth his presence for the service of Thy Cause, he beseecheth Thee for his release from the prison of the transgressors and his arising before Thy gate, O Thou Who art the Ultimate Goal of the hopes of those who have hope and the Desire of the hearts of the sincere ones.\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice for your imprisonment, steadfastness and uprising! Your successive letters arrived. In truth, each was a luminous lamp and a manifest, resplendent light. Praise be to God, mention of your eminence transformed the darkness of sorrows and somewhat dispelled the bitterness of separation and parting. Likewise, the petitions submitted to the presence of the Two Branches - may my spirit, being and essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - all arrived and were repeatedly read, especially the account of events that arrived the day before. Its details were written in the letter of the honored beloved T.A. - upon him be the glory and favors of God - which will reach your presence, God willing.\n\nAs for events in this land, all are reposing in the shadow \\[of God's protection\\] and engaged in divine thanksgiving. This year, outwardly there is abundant bounty. The merchants, heedless of God, are busy purchasing wheat, but profit, like justice, mercy and fairness, is absent in those parts. Although it has reached ten ghurush, nevertheless whatever each has bought remains imprisoned in warehouses. The poor loved ones have made no profit this year either. Some merchants from outlying areas have requested transport to send what has been collected; perhaps God, exalted be His glory, will bestow His favor and bring forth seekers. The command is in His hands. In these years, such abundant and inexpensive bounty has not been seen, although compared to those realms it is still dear and expensive. Nevertheless, no one has profited. Exalted is the Creator and exalted is His command! Consummate wisdom remains hidden from hearts and eyes. As for other things, they remain as expensive as you have observed.\n\nThis evanescent one beseeches and hopes that God will open the door of comfort, wealth, knowledge and ease for all. Verily, He is powerful over all things. In any case, after the arrival of your eminent letter and this evanescent servant's perusal thereof, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Goal and Supreme Summit. Your supplication was presented before the Divine Presence, as were the supplications contained in other letters, each at its appropriate time. Your eminence knows that everything received from that Beloved One is presented, and after the presentation of each, the ocean of divine bounty surges in such wise that this servant is incapable of describing it. You yourself have been present and heard. Were this evanescent one to attempt to provide details, he would be unable and these pages would not suffice. When your last letter was presented before the Divine Presence, these brilliant verses shone forth from the Dayspring of favor. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the Caller from the Supreme Horizon \\[...\\]\n\nO My Name! Your imprisonment and what hath befallen thee in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath truly grieved Me. We have made mention of thee in diverse Tablets and in that which hath been revealed for My loved ones in all regions by the Pen of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne. We have forbidden the servant from holding the feast which he arranged each year. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the soul that hath grieved at thy grief and hath recalled what befell thee at the hands of the heedless ones. Give thanks unto God for having adorned thee with the crown of patience, by whose light the Concourse on High and they that circle round My glorious and wondrous Station have been illumined. O Mahdi! The Wronged One hath made mention of thee with such mention as cannot be equaled by all the bounties of the world and whatsoever is seen therein. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful. They that have wronged thee and commanded thy imprisonment - these have no portion in the Book of God, the Possessor of this luminous Day. Thou hast attained unto that which none hath attained except whom God, thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, hath willed. The Most Exalted Pen hath made mention of thee morn and eve, to this beareth witness the Lord of Names in His manifest prison. Thou art he who hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath borne that which caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament, and those who circle round this exalted Station. The wrongdoers shall soon behold the recompense of their deeds, and the sincere ones what hath been ordained for them by the Pen of God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Thus hath soared the Bird of Utterance, and spoken the Pen of the All-Merciful, and cooed the Dove of the Cause upon the branches, by the command of One Who is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon those who love thee and make mention of thee at morn and at eventide.\n\nThat which hath been revealed from the Kingdom of God's bounty, exalted be His glory, specifically for that honored one is not and was not limited to these verses. Numerous Tablets have been revealed and by command some are being sent. His bounty is not such as to be confined within limits or to come to an end. It hath been and forever shall be. Exalted be His bounty, exalted be His majesty, great be His grace, and all-embracing be His mercy. This evanescent servant, in the nights and days, beseecheth and imploreth the Goal of all existence to grant once more the blessing of meeting, reunion and gathering. In the realm of dreams, what was sought hath been witnessed several times, and it is most strange that until now it hath been delayed. With utmost humility and supplication, this request hath been and is being made of the Self-Sufficing Lord. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nAnd regarding that which was written in the blessed letters appointing this servant as representative for visiting the Goal of the worlds - praise be to God, this evanescent one hath been honored with acceptance each time, and even without representation, at special times that which no deeds of men and jinn can equal hath been accomplished. Exalted is the bounty of our Lord and our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Were eloquent and articulate tongues to appear to the number of all created things, they could not render thanks for even a single confirmation and success that hath been granted, unless His grace should aid and bestow that which is befitting and worthy. In Him do we trust and to Him do we commit all affairs. He knoweth and ordaineth, therefore He hath been and is the Beloved.\n\nAnd regarding what you wrote about Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God - his verses arrived and by command Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Rida, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, copied them on very fine paper, and both his writing and the original were presented, and this servant submitted all before His presence. This is what the tongue of our Lord, the All-Bestowing, spoke in reply - His blessed and exalted Word: \\[...\\]\n\nO thou rememberer and praiser! We have heard thy remembrance and thy praise hath reached the ears of the Wronged One. Praise be to God that thou hast attained His presence. If the opposing souls permit, thou shalt, God willing, attain again. Some of the heedless ones are engaged in manifest tyranny, and the flame of self and passion hath so seized them that they are deprived of hearkening to the Word of Truth and forbidden from beholding the horizon of justice. They have not distinguished the mischief-maker from the reformer, nor the wise from the ignorant. Justice and tyranny are the same to them, and knowledge and ignorance weigh equally. Well was it said:\n\n\"Nay, nay, for heaven and fate know not the worth of merit,\n\nThus spake my father to me in the days of my youth.\"\n\nWhile at ease they remain heedless, and in times of hardship and tribulation they lament and wail, but their lamentation availeth them not, neither their wailing, nor their helplessness, nor their weeping. Consider the Emperor of Paris. Out of pure grace We revealed a special Tablet for him and informed him of certain matters and warned him. That heedless one was so deluded that he made light of the Divine Tablet. Though he received it, no reply was forthcoming from him. At the time of \"yea\" he was silent, and at the station of \"yes\" he was mute. Later another Tablet was revealed from the heaven of will, and We informed him of the tribulations that were advancing from behind him. Nevertheless, the veils prevented him from understanding, and love of position deprived him of awareness, until the divine term arrived and the irrevocable decree descended. He found for himself no helper, nor supporter, nor companion.\n\nThe people of the world are deluded by the glory of a day or two, and even that is uncertain, for the poor wretch knoweth not whether in the next hour he will descend from palace to grave. Nevertheless, he doeth that which causeth the denizens of the celestial Kingdom to lament and weep. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss.\n\nWhatever hath befallen thee is in the path of God. Today the Truth is wronged and dwelleth in prison. His friends must assist Him through the hosts of goodly character and praiseworthy deeds. These hosts are mightier than the hosts of the world. In truth, spiritual qualities and praiseworthy deeds and goodly words, sealed with the decree \"We are of the Truth and a bounty from His presence,\" have been sent down from heaven to earth in glory. Give praise unto the Goal of the world that He hath mentioned thee in prison with a mention whose fragrance shall never cease. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve this station which He hath graciously bestowed.\n\nThis evanescent one also conveyeth greetings to them. Praise be to God that they have been enabled to offer praise and glorification and remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. Their ode was recited in His presence and likewise before the inmates of the pavilion of grandeur and infallibility. This is a bounty from God, our Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nConcerning the coolness of eyes \\[beloved ones\\], upon them be the glory of God, His loving-kindness and His grace, about which you wrote - this is most clear and evident. The utmost loving-kindness is ever flowing toward them. I am constantly inquiring about their condition and am delighted by their presence. Praise be to God, all are safe, settled and at rest beneath the canopy of mercy. In these days the honored beloved, Haji Seyyed Javad, upon him be the glory of God, has proceeded to Beirut in consideration of the commercial interests of the honored Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, who has been appointed there, and he is now residing in Beirut. For this reason they have become somewhat alone. For a time, the mother of Haji Ali, upon them both be the glory of God, who had come by command, was residing with them. Now the family of the Haji has returned and all are dwelling in that same house. A person has been specially appointed for the Leaf \\[female believer\\], upon her be the glory of God, to take her to and from school.\n\nAs for other events from that land, some movement has also appeared in this land. The Persian chief who is in the Sublime Porte sent letters to some and mentioned certain arranged suspicions therein. Thus far no effect has appeared. As for the travelers, despite the greatest prohibition, they have arrived and continue to arrive. Among those souls who have come with permission are the honored Afnans of the Blessed Tree, upon them be all the Most Glorious Glory. The honored and exalted Afnan-i-Kabir, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory - who is in truth a portion of light - first came with the honored Aqa Mirza Aqa and the exalted ladies, his wife, daughter and granddaughter, upon them be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, who were related to the elevated Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, along with two luminaries. After receiving permission for departure they left. Now again for nearly two months they have come and taken up residence in a special house near the Shrine, engaged in circumambulation and pilgrimage.\n\nThe honored Afnan, Aqa Seyyed M., the honored teacher, and Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon them be all the Most Glorious Glory, came after the first visit of Afnan-i-Kabir and stayed for a time. Some of them were blessed with attainment twice and then took their leave. The honored Afnan Haji Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory, also came in the service of my Master, the Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps. He too was blessed with attainment and then by command went to Beirut. On his return he was again honored with attainment and set out for the land of Ha. Blessed and congratulations to them!\n\nThe honored and exalted Afnan-i-Kabir has taken up residence in Beirut. Praise be to God, he was and is in the utmost joy, delight and gladness. Furthermore, news has arrived and continues to arrive from every quarter. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to grant insight to the rulers that they may know with clear certainty that this Cause is sanctified above what they have imagined, and that the welfare of all lies in its manifestation and exaltation. May He also grant fairness to the divines and aid them to reflect \\[...\\]\n\nLet everyone reflect upon and call to mind the divines of past ages who lived in the days of the Manifestations. Glory be to God! Every person of insight is bewildered and every fair-minded one is astonished at what could be the cause and reason for such oppression, and what could be its justification. In all conditions, we must resign all affairs unto Him and place our trust in Him. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAnother supplication: This servant was blessed each year to offer hospitality in Your service, but last year, due to Your imprisonment and the martyrdom of His Holiness Ali, may my spirit be sacrificed for him, it was, according to command, prevented. This servant, in truth, had no inclination for it. In these days, as news has arrived and signs of joy have somewhat appeared, You commanded to resume the practice of previous years due to the appearance of gladness which has dawned and shone forth. Whatever You have sent will be spent at the appointed time. Praise be to God in all this. This servant fears lest the hearing of detailed petitions cause weariness and trouble. Since You wrote in Your letter addressed to the beloved ones, His Holiness the Name of Bounty and His Holiness Javad, upon them be the glory of God, the Lord of creation, commanding that the events of this land be written and sent in detail, therefore this servant has submitted some news. In all cases, forgiveness is hoped for.\n\nRegarding what You wrote about the honored lady, the mother of His Honor A.T., and the honored wife of His Honor Mirza, upon them both be the glory of God - in Your first letter You mentioned the mother of His Honor A.T., and after it was submitted to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, she was named \"Mother of the Saints.\" Exalted is this lofty station and this Most Great and wondrous Name. A special message was written to her son: whosoever arises to serve You, their deed is accepted before the Throne. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. In truth, he is counted among the men of God and mentioned among the pillars. His mention has been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Most Glorious Station. You should give them glad-tidings and make them happy with the bounties of God. Likewise regarding the other leaf, the wife of His Honor Mirza, upon them both be the glory of God, which was mentioned in Your letter this time - it was presented before the Throne. This is what the Lord of the worlds spoke, exalted be His utterance and glorified be His grandeur:\n\nI am the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nO My Name! The Pen lamenteth and maketh mention in times of hardship and tribulation, and in times of joy and gladness. Through its motion it moveth and speaketh, and by its movement the world is set in motion. This movement ariseth from the heat of the utterance of the All-Merciful - some of it manifest and some concealed. Were one to observe with the eye of insight the realities of all things, one would witness how all are drawn, in their inmost essence, toward the Call of the Most Exalted Pen and its movement toward the Throne, and its effects have been and shall continue to be made manifest and resplendent day after day. Except for those in whom no trace remaineth as recompense for their deeds - such souls are as ashes, neither were nor are they capable of life.\n\nThe servant present made mention of the Leaf, the Mother of 'A?a, upon both of whom be the glory of God. After hearing of thy contentment, We named her the Mother of the Near Ones. Verily this was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen upon the Tablet by the command of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. Neither centuries nor ages shall erase this mention, nor shall this edifice be ruined. It shall forever be adorned with the garment of preservation. O My Name! Give her glad tidings from Me and remind her of My verses, then recite unto her what hath been revealed for her from God, the Lord of the worlds. And give glad tidings from Me to My other handmaiden who hath attained the grace of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThe mention of those handmaidens who attained to service in the days of tribulation hath been and shall remain immortalized in the divine Books and Scriptures. In these days, a special Visitation Tablet for the Martyr 'Ali, upon him be the mercy of God, His grace and His favor, hath been revealed, wherein certain women have been mentioned. This is distinct from the first Visitation Tablet that was sent. Verily, He wasteth not the reward of the doers of good. Not an atom's weight of deeds shall be lost. In previous Books, God, exalted be His glory, hath given tidings saying that all shall receive their recompense and reward on the Day of God. He hath likewise given tidings that whatsoever is hidden and forbidden from sight shall be made manifest. Behold what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an - blessed and exalted be His words: \"And if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.\"\n\nGladden the other Leaf with God's bounty. Praise be to God, they have attained unto service to His Cause in His days and been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Let them know the value of this station and preserve it through the Name of God, exalted be His glory.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to each one. In truth, these Leaves are among the leaves of Paradise. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ever keep them and their like preserved beneath the shadow of His grace. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAs to the mention made of him who hath turned to God and is imprisoned in His path, Aqa Siyyid Aqa-Buzurg, upon him be the glory and grace of God, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Threshold. This is what was revealed for him and those with him from Mim. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing \\[...\\]\n\nO My Name! The morning breezes wafting from the garden of inner meanings brought this word to hearing: \"Blessed is he whose strength is not weakened by the doubts of the learned, and blessed is he who stands firm when the oppression of princes would make him sit.\" Allah-u-Akbar! In these days when at every moment there can be heard the murmuring of the Kawthar of utterance, the whisper of divine breezes, and the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha - were the ears of the world but pure, a single word would suffice for all and guide them to the highest horizon. Blessed are My loved ones who have attained unto tribulation and adversity in My path and who have, for love of My Beauty, drunk from the chalice of trials.\n\nVerily We have mentioned him who was named Aqa Buzurg time and again, and then the people of Mim who were imprisoned in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. O My Name! All those souls who have been imprisoned in God's path and those who have been scattered and disturbed through fear of the oppressors - all have been honored with mention by the Supreme Pen. There have befallen the people of Mim afflictions the like of which have never been heard of in the world. By the life of God! This oppression will cause universal sedition and corruption in the world. Soon that which is now hidden from knowledge and sight shall be revealed. Convey to all greetings and glorification from the Wronged One, and give them glad tidings. Soon will the hand of divine power once again begin to seize the oppressors. Guard this and be of them that conceal it.\n\nNot for a moment hath the Truth been heedless of those souls, and is not now. In the night when every eye sleeps, the eye of God, exalted be His glory, is ever watching over His loved ones who have been afflicted. The wickedness of the servants hath reached such a pass that the Supreme Pen lamenteth, for it hath uttered the words of the friends of old: \"Hide thy gold, thy comings and goings, and thy beliefs, and dissimulation is my religion and the religion of my forefathers.\" After the martyrdom of Badi', upon him be My glory and My mercy, the decree of wisdom was firmly established in God's Book - that is, it was clearly and explicitly mentioned. Likewise, after the martyrdom of His Holiness 'Ali, the decree of concealment was revealed: \"None should openly confess this Cause before the faces of men.\" All must gaze toward the Supreme Horizon and act according to that which appears from His presence.\n\nThe Most Glorious Splendor be upon thee from God, the Lord of all being, and upon those who are with thee in prison, and upon those who have attained unto patience in this mighty Cause.\n\nVerily some are weak and have no endurance, becoming disturbed and shaken by the slightest thing. In all cases consideration for the weak is necessary, therefore the mercy and favor of God, exalted be His glory, encompasses all and this wondrous Cause has been revealed from the Supreme Pen. The servant verily gives thanks to God, his Lord, and praises Him in all conditions. He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nMention was made of his honor Aqa Siyyid Khalil, upon him be the glory of God. His mention has attained to the hearing of the Lord of Names, and this is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the Possessor of all names, in this station. He says, blessed and exalted be He: \\[...\\]\n\nO Khalil! Blessed art thou for having shattered the idols of idle fancy with the arm of certitude and turned to the Supreme Horizon when every remote scholar turned away from it--they who, when the name of the Qa'im was mentioned, would arise and say \"May God hasten His relief,\" yet when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, they disbelieved in Him and unjustly pronounced judgment against Him, whereat every discerning mystic did lament. Say: O concourse of divines! Where is your praise and glorification, and where is your postponement and hastening regarding the Manifestation of God and His proof? Fear God and follow not your idle fancies; rather follow Him Who hath come to you with a manifest light. Say: O heedless ones! Why did the idol-worshipping divines turn away when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, appeared, and by what proof did the Jews deny when the Spirit came, and by what evidence did the tyrants and pharaohs turn away from God, the Lord of the worlds? Behold and then recall what hath appeared from you throughout the ages and centuries; then judge with fairness in this Cause wherewith God gave glad tidings in the Books of the past and future, and before His face the Faithful Spirit giveth you glad tidings. Say: Fear God and make not vain imaginings lords over yourselves. Set aside what ye possess and take what ye are commanded by One mighty, bidding, wise. We have come to teach you the mysteries of the Book and guide you to My straight path. Say: By God! My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor do I walk in your ways. To this doth the tongue of My favor in the kingdom of My wondrous utterance bear witness. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones once again, that the fragrances of My words may attract them to a station wherein the intimations of men who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of destiny, shall not grieve them. Say: The profit is yours and from you, while they are in manifest loss. Beware lest the might of the powerful weaken you, or the tyranny of the princes frighten you. Cast aside the manifestations of fancy and idle imaginings, clinging to the hem of God, the Mighty, the Great. Ye have heard the gloating of the enemies, and today ye hear the verses of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. By what hath befallen you, the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names have lamented. To this doth bear witness this Wronged One, this Stranger. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon every steadfast upholder of the truth.\n\n\\[The Arabic portion ends here\\]\n\nPraise be to God! The luminous elder was seized by the Most Great Light, and for the spiritual chalice of water, a hundred thousand \"well done\" would not suffice for this ocean, and this station is not attainable save through divine confirmation, glorified be His majesty.\n\nAs for what you wrote concerning consultation, after presentation they said that if disagreement arises among the first group assembled, new souls should be added and then by drawing lots select the number of the Greatest Name, or less or more than that, and consult anew. Whatever emerges therefrom is to be obeyed. And if disagreement still persists, \"adorn the two with a third and take the strongest.\" Verily, He guideth whom He willeth to the straight path. Thus hath the Lord of all beings decreed in this station.\n\nAnd mention was made of two souls, with expressions of satisfaction. I beseech God to confirm them in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word among the people. Their mention attained the honor of being heard in the Most Holy Court and was adorned and distinguished by the favor of the Beloved of the worlds.\n\nAs for the mention of the angel of mercy and the kindler of the bath of love which they wrote about, after presentation this exalted word appeared from the horizon of the will of the Lord of Names, glorified and exalted be His utterance: We beseech God to confirm this one in recognizing the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Dayspring of Inspiration, and to make him steadfast therein. Verily He is the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nIn truth, whoever thou mayest be, as the possessor of pure deeds, mention of thee is essential and acceptable in the gathering of the chosen ones. This evanescent servant implores and beseeches God that He may strengthen the chief of that place, adorn him with justice and fairness, deliver him from the darkness of heedlessness, and illumine him with the light of certainty. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nI have always offered, and continue to offer, praise and glory to all the people of Baha. At the end of these supplications, this exalted Word was revealed from the Source of Names following the incident in that land. His blessed and exalted Word states:\n\n\"One must proceed with moderation and be content with the minimum necessity, for if the people of error become aware of the coming and going of correspondence, matters will surely become difficult for the Name of God (66).\"\n\nUntil now, this servant has received multiple letters from certain ones, yet until this time no reply was sent. In these days, according to capacity and station, a letter was written and sent to the honored beloved, his eminence 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for him. In any case, great care must be taken, for if they sense that correspondence is being exchanged in the prison, it will lead to a complete prohibition. Otherwise, God is witness that the heart is occupied with thy remembrance, and hath loved and continues to love to reveal, through the assistance of God, exalted be His Glory, by means of pen and ink, whatever lies hidden in the treasury of love. God sufficeth as witness. The purpose is that if there has been delay and suspension in expressing sincerity, it has been for this reason.\n\nFurthermore, all the inhabitants of the pavilion of grandeur and infallibility have repeatedly sent their greetings and praise, which this servant is to convey. Whenever mention is made of thee, all become saddened, but when reading thy letters, sometimes sadness and sometimes joy is experienced, and both are evident and clear. They have repeatedly told this servant that whenever thou writest something, convey our greetings and praise. Likewise, the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, being and essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - has expressed much surprise that His blessed letter has not arrived, and this servant is also perplexed. However, the Most Mighty Branch - may my spirit, being and essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - has written and sent multiple times. During the revelation of verses, these words were revealed: \"Write to the Name that he should read, that is, recite in a beautiful voice, that joy and gladness from the Speaker of Sinai may take hold of him:\n\nWe are lovers of Thy face\n\nWe are dwellers in Thy lane\n\nWe are bound by Thy tresses\n\nI seek Thy presence\n\nI seek Thy good pleasure\n\nO Thou for whom I would sacrifice myself\n\nEver seeking from God\n\nEver seeking from Baha\"\n\nWe are seekers of Thy city, we are pilgrims of Thy prison, we are servants of Thy Cause. We desire Thy cruelty, we desire Thy affliction, our souls are sacrificed to Thee. Hasten to seek from God, hasten to seek from Baha! We are gazelles of Thy wilderness, we are fish in Thy net, we are guardians of Thy throne. We desire Thy beauty, we desire Thy glory, O Thou to Whom I am sacrificed! Hasten to seek from God, hasten to seek from Baha!\n\nThat which was revealed was more extensive, but this much suffices. It is hoped that henceforth complete joy will be attained. He said: \"O servant present! The purpose of this pleasantry is to gladden the Name of God; otherwise, due to the oppression of the enemies, the Pen hath withheld its treasures, and the Water of Life floweth only in measure.\"\n\nPraise be to God, the letter was sealed with the musk of God's pleasantry. In truth, its attraction hath produced a wondrous effect on this night, especially if one hearkeneth to the melody of God. Complete bounty, all-encompassing grace, pre-existent mercy, and all-embracing kindness. We praise Him for what He hath bestowed upon us through His generosity and grace. Verily, He is the Generous, the Munificent. Glory, remembrance, praise, light and radiance be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you, and who hear your words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nMay my spirit be a sacrifice unto you! At this moment, again, as commanded, I turned towards the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. After attaining the presence and standing, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke and said - exalted be His majesty and sublime be His utterance: \"We wish to mention at this time one who hath turned towards My direction and migrated from his homeland, advancing to the Most Exalted Homeland, the Most Glorious Horizon, the Supreme Height, and the Ultimate Goal, until he arrived at the Most Great Prison and stood before a door which the Hand of Providence had opened unto the face of all who are in earth and heaven, and heard the call of the Wronged One, and attained that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nO Abul-Qasim! The Wronged One makes mention of thee before all faces. Rejoice thou in this remembrance, which nothing on earth can equal. He Who possesses the Sealed Book beareth witness to this. Behold and call to mind when thou didst arrive with Us at the Castle, and that which was revealed for thee was such that had We cast it upon the mountains, thou wouldst have beheld them prostrate before the face of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Praise be to God, thou hast been and art remembered. The glances of loving-kindness have ever been directed towards thee. In the prison, recall those days of joy and meeting. Blessed art thou! The Wronged One testifieth that thou hast attained that which was promised in the Books of God, both past and future, and didst enter prison for My Name's sake, whereby the limbs of every remote oppressor trembled. My Name, upon Him be My Glory, hath made mention of thee, and the servant present before the Wronged One hath renewed it. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loveth thee for the sake of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. What do the oppressors say, and how do they curse the oppressors of the past? By the life of God! Soon shall they lament and find for themselves neither helper nor protector. Thus have We adorned thy temple with the ornament of Our loving grace, thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. The Glory be upon thee from Us and upon those who have shown patience, seeking the good pleasure of God, the Mighty, the Praised.\n\nFurthermore, this evanescent one conveys greetings and salutations to them and declares that the days of meeting have not been and will not be forgotten. Their manifestation in the garden during the days of meeting was evident. Their deeds are ever manifest in new splendor and adorned before all eyes. Though the friends have lost all they possessed in the path of the Goal of all worlds, yet the fortresses of love and devotion remain in their possession. There, the highest power of princes is weak and the mightiest armies of the world are as nothing. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ordain for them that which is lasting and eternal. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Glory and praise be upon your honor and upon those who have adorned their temples with patience and forbearance in the Cause of God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nA further submission is that a letter was received after the conclusion of this petition, adorned with mention and supplication to God, exalted be His glory, and the leaf of prayers and devotions, the details of which your honor had inscribed on the back, also arrived and was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings on Thursday morning, the 19th of Dhi'l-Hajjih. This is what was revealed for his honor Siyyid A.S., upon him be the Glory of God. His word is mighty in utterance and sublime in proof:\n\nIn My Name, Which Warbleth upon the Branches \\[...\\]\n\nGod beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the Kingdom of verses is indeed the One promised in all the Books and Tablets. Every tablet hath been adorned with His mention and every book with His praise, yet the people have denied His proof and disputed His verses whereby the horizons were illumined. The servant who is present hath appeared before the Wronged One and read that which thy heart's tongue had uttered in remembrance of God, the Lord of Lords. We have heard thy call from the prison and have answered thee with verses that nothing in all creation can equal, to which My Most Exalted Pen in this station doth testify. Thy mention and thy praise have attained unto My hearing, and We have adorned them with the ornament of Our acceptance. Thy Lord is verily the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is he who hath borne hardships in His love and hath entered prison in My Name, the One Who holdeth dominion over all who are in earth and heaven. The oppressors shall soon behold the recompense of their deeds even as the people before them beheld it. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book by God, the Lord of all men. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose appearance the Path was laid and the Balance set up and the mountains were moved. The splendor shining from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon every patient soul who placeth his trust in God.\n\nThis was revealed for his honor Mim-Qaf-Ra, upon him be the glory of God. He saith, exalted be His majesty and greatness:\n\nIn the name of the peerless Lord, the All-Knowing!\n\nConsider the party that counted themselves the most exalted of all parties. Throughout ages and centuries they were occupied with the mention of the Truth, and the divines were honored and accepted through His name. Sometimes lamenting and sometimes wailing, at times supplicating God, exalted be His glory, beseeching the meeting with the Promised One. They would stand at His mention and utter \"may God hasten His relief.\" Yet when the Light of the Cause shown forth from the horizon of the world by God's will, they did that which pens and tongues are powerless to describe. They walk in the wilderness of error yet perceive it not, and move in the desert of wretchedness yet remain heedless and unaware. God hath seized them for their sin and made them a lesson to those who have cast the world behind them, turning unto God, the Lord of all worlds. This Day hath no peer or likeness. Well is it with the soul whom doubts and allusions did not withhold from the Dayspring of revelation and the Source of verses. The servant hath attained the presence of the Wronged One and thy mention hath won His hearing. We do truly pray for thee and glorify thee from this station that joy and gladness may seize thee through this mighty grace. Verily He is with thee, hearing and seeing, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The glory be upon thee and upon whoso hath held fast to the cord of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.\n\nEnd.\n\nPraise be to God, two honored souls have attained to the sweet savors of God's verses. This servant also conveyeth to them greetings and salutations. Would that I were with your honor and with them in the prison for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all in the heavens and earth. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to honor them with the light of His Cause and grant them shelter beneath the tree of His loving care. Verily He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers.\n\nAnother submission: From every quarter mention of your honor hath arrived. Among these, yesterday a letter arrived from his honor the beloved Amin, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and your honor's handwriting within it was truly situated in its heart. After it was read and reviewed, it was presented at the Divine Throne. This is what the Tongue of the Beloved spoke in reply \\[...\\]\n\nThis time We have made frequent mention of Ismu'llah. Now one must pray that the True One, exalted be His glory, may bestow upon Ismu'llah in prison an opportunity to read that which hath been revealed. The Tablet was repeated, the addresses were repeated.\n\nLikewise, the letter of My beloved, the honored 'Andalib, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, which your honor sent, was seen. After reading and reviewing it, it was presented. This is what the Tongue of the Desired One hath spoken:\n\n\"O My Name! 'Andalib hath many claims upon Us. He is the creditor and We are the debtor. We beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to discharge this debt, for it hath been some time since any specific mention hath outwardly been sent to him, although he hath been and is remembered in the Most Holy Court. God willing, in these days the Supreme Pen shall arise to make amends. Verily, give him glad tidings from Me and remind him of My remembrance and My bounty. O My Name! We have found him to be among the patient ones. This utterance from God, the Lord of the worlds, suffice him.\"\n\nIt is submitted that many of his odes in praise and glorification of the Beloved of the worlds have been received, and in these days he hath sent ghazals in remembrance of the Sovereign of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen. These were read in the presence of the Throne and those who circle round it, and the original was given to the Afnan that they might make copies thereof. The purpose is that the glances of favor have been and are directed towards him. This evanescent one hath at all times sought for him whatsoever is worthy of grace and bounty. In all conditions I beseech and supplicate the True One for help, that at least once more we may, beneath the shade of the Tree, speak and hear with your honor and the friends that which attracteth hearts and souls. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Beloved.\n\nThe Servant\n\n29 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1301\n\n=== END BH00059 ===\n\n=== START BH00060 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the direction of the Throne, and which the evanescent servant before His countenance, 'Abdu'r-Razzaq, hath written:\n\nThy letter reached the Most Sublime Vision, and from the raiment of its words were diffused the sweet savors of the love of the Lord of Names and Attributes. Praise be unto God that through the bounty of the All-Merciful thou hast attained unto the ocean of divine knowledge. This is indeed a great bounty, for thou hast recognized that station which most of the servants are veiled from. Today the people of the Bayan, who regard themselves as having attained the highest pinnacle of knowledge, have not sufficiently understood what was intended by the appearance of the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for His sake.\n\nShould they say the purpose was to establish Divine Unity and the exaltation of Divine Oneness, all have testified and do testify that there is no God but Him. No sun hath risen from the heaven of Divine Will except that it hath shone forth in the form of \"There is no God but Him,\" and no fragrance hath wafted from the Divine and Heavenly Paradise save that it hath borne the sweet scent of Unity. Indeed, all that they have mentioned concerning the stations of Unity and the heights of detachment had a purpose, yet all remained veiled from that purpose. In such case, nothing remaineth for these souls save a verbal unity to which all give utterance.\n\nBy the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth! Words in this Most Great Revelation are powerless to bear the hidden meanings which lie concealed within the Divine Pen. Consider the Pharaoh-like souls among the people of the Bayan - they have not rent asunder the veils of words, much less attained unto the meanings thereof. Although those possessed of insight have comprehended infinite meanings from every word of this Revelation, this is confined to such souls and remaineth concealed from others, sealed with the seal of protection. Were capacity to be found, that from which they are now veiled would be made manifest unto all.\n\nShould they say the purpose of His appearance was to establish the outward divine ordinances among men, all Messengers were commissioned with this service, and in the eyes of them that are endued with insight, this station is but one of the degrees in the revelation of Divine Power. Most people are so veiled that the veils of previous religions have vanished in comparison. Out of their hatred for God, they cling to new objections at every moment, although all know that through this Most Great Revelation that which was revealed in the Bayan hath been established, made manifest and realized, the Name of God hath been upraised, and His signs have been spread throughout the East and the West. The Persian Bayan hath been specifically confirmed in this Revelation, yet they continuously write that the Bayan hath been abrogated, perchance they might cast doubt in hearts and establish the worship of the calf.\n\nO people of the Bayan! I adjure you by God to show a little fairness and to look upon the divine verses with pure and sanctified eyes, and to ponder with hallowed hearts. The highest degree of the verses mentioned in the Bayan is, according to its people, the station of unity, yet those who have turned aside are wholly veiled from this station, for they have not yet risen to that level wherein they behold the Manifestations of God as one Being and one Essence, and Their laws as one law. What more can be expected from such souls who, while regarding themselves as having attained the highest pinnacle of knowledge, remain halted at stations such as these, which represent but one of the degrees of unity\\[...\\]\n\nLet those souls that see themselves at the summit of understanding consider how it is that those who deem themselves to be at the loftiest heights of mystical knowledge are perplexed, bewildered, veiled and wholly unaware of their condition in matters such as this, which represents but one of the degrees of divine unity. Not every soul is worthy to hearken unto the Word of God, nor is every being capable of drinking from the crystal waters of inner meaning that have flowed from the Fountainhead of divine Will in this holy and transcendent Revelation. Indeed, the distinction mentioned in the divine Tablets had other intended meanings, yet after the revelation of the Bayan and the diffusion of its knowledge, for a soul to lack even enough awareness to recognize the unity of God's laws - by God, non-existence would better befit such a one than existence. Furthermore, by what reasoning or insight could the divine Manifestation and the dawning of God's transcendent glory be made contingent upon the abrogation of a previous dispensation? Many have been the divine Manifestations Who have come and confirmed the laws of the previous dispensation, enforcing and establishing them, for the decree of the previous Manifestation is identical to that of the subsequent One, having been revealed aforetime. Today, should anyone differentiate between or perceive separation between God's laws and the Manifestations of His transcendent glory, such a one has been and shall remain outside the pale of divine unity. Say: O cross-eyed ones of the age, see not double and lament not! If ye cannot ascend to the heaven of inner meanings, at least comprehend what hath been revealed in the Bayan, wherein He saith \"I am the very essence of Muhammad, and that which proceedeth from Me is that which proceeded from Him.\" And in another instance He declareth that were it not for the protestations and opposition of the followers of the Furqan, the laws of the Furqan would not have been abrogated in this Revelation. Both abrogation and confirmation have been and shall ever be established at one and the same holy station, were ye to understand. All matters depend upon God's Will and the decree of that true Sovereign. For if at this moment a law were to be sent down from the heaven of divine Will, commanding all servants to observe it, and subsequently its abrogation were revealed, none hath the right to object, for that which your Lord, the Lord of the Appointed Day, hath willed is what shall be accomplished. Consider the abrogating and abrogated verses in the Furqan, how certain verses were revealed and then abrogated by subsequent ones. It would seem the polytheists of the Bayan have not even read the Qur'an. What say they to this, that even before the previous verse's decree had been established and confirmed among the people, how could it be permissible for it to be abrogated by another verse? By Him Who hath caused me to speak the truth, ye shall find naught in these people save unbelief, transgression, heedlessness and perdition. Their heedlessness hath reached such a point that they now object to the Sovereign of the seen and unseen by clinging to that which they formerly believed and which was explicitly mentioned in the Book of God, such as the matter of abrogating and abrogated verses in the Furqan. They are more brutish than the brutish, more heedless than any heedless one, more remote than any remote one, and more ignorant than any ignorant one. Leave them, O people, to themselves, that they may wallow in their desires and sport with what they possess. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hands, all the words of the Bayan and the laws revealed therein lament the tyranny of those polytheists. Though they mention the Bayan with their tongues to preserve their leadership, they have visited upon its Revealer that which no religious community hath ever visited upon the divine Manifestations. Fie upon the people of the Bayan! The utmost accomplishment of their leaders is that they have denied this mighty decree concerning the Manifestation for Whose sake the Bayan was revealed as a herald.\n\nLet them play with what they have. By Him Who holds my soul in His hands, all the verses of the Bayan and its revealed ordinances lament the cruelty of those polytheists. Though mention of the Bayan flows from their tongues out of their desire to preserve their leadership, they have perpetrated against its Revealer that which no people have ever inflicted upon the Divine Manifestations. Shame upon the people of the Bayan! The utmost achievement of their leaders is that they have denied this firm decree concerning the Manifestation for Whom the Bayan was revealed as a herald, and have committed treachery in the Divine sanctuary which had been forbidden in all the holy Books, and have martyred the third letter of those who believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest. So shameless are they that, despite these abhorrent and reprehensible deeds, they object to this Revelation, claiming that since the decree of the Bayan is not yet established, a new Revelation is not permissible. Observe how they have assumed people to be mere donkeys! By their actions they abrogate all the firm ordinances and established verses of the Bayan, while in their words they write \"eat not onions and drink not tobacco,\" yet they have objected to and denied Him by Whose command hundreds of thousands of religious laws have been established and implemented. How blind are these people who have given ear to the idle fancies of those souls and continue to do so, accepting from them excuses that are greater than sin itself! By God! Better that sight be blinded than behold such allusions, and better that hearts cease to exist than remain veiled by such veils. Furthermore, they are heedless that in the school of divine knowledge souls have appeared who can distinguish truth from falsehood by their intuition, and can recognize the people of the Most Sublime Vision from the companions of the Fire, and who have, through the grace of the All-Merciful, become cognizant of that which was revealed in the Bayan. Upon them be the mercy of God, His blessings, His wondrous bounties and His favors. Specifically from the Supreme Pen have God's ordinances been revealed that this Manifestation should not be troubled by such matters, and no hardship should befall the Most Holy Beauty. Thus they say that whoever has a question or desires verses should ask now, that they may be revealed, lest, God forbid, a question be asked that would cause grief to that Ancient Beauty. And specifically they state: \"He it is Who speaks in all things, saying: 'I am God, there is no God but Me,'\" lest any objection remain for anyone. All these emphases were because they knew to what matters the people of the Bayan would cling. That Essence of the heart which is so delicate and sensitive that He advised all those in the Bayan never to utter in His presence a word from which the fragrance of grief might be detected - observe how much harm the people of the Bayan have inflicted, despite the fact that in this Revelation matters have appeared which have never occurred since the beginning of creation, and verses have been revealed the like of which have never been heard. And whatever they have asked of the Most Great Ocean, they have received sufficient and healing answers, and most souls have attained that which they sought, except for matters whose harm and impropriety were hidden from the view of the questioners and seekers; therefore these were not granted, and instead stations and ranks were bestowed which, were but one of them to become manifest, all the peoples of the world would be thunderstruck. In any case, the Divine Dove has in every world a different melody \\[...\\]\n\nIn every realm the Divine Dove hath a distinct melody, and upon every branch a different song which none save God hath ever fully comprehended or ever shall comprehend. Is there none to ask these apostates where they had been during the time when this Divine Youth was engaged, amidst His enemies, in spreading the signs of God and exalting His remembrance? The leaders of the Bayan, from fear for their lives, remained in hiding and kept company with women - may God destroy them! Then when the Cause of God was made manifest, they emerged and cast aside the ordinances upon which the entire Bayan was contingent and established, as ye have seen and heard.\n\nConsider what they say regarding the year Nine which is mentioned in the Bayan. The honored Siyyah, upon him be the Glory of God, is present and in these days was in the presence of the Face, and mentioned that in the last days the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - gave him the glad tidings that he would attain the presence of the Desired One. He wrote the details of the Primal Point's glad tidings of this Most Great Manifestation to that polytheist, yet they remained heedless. Siyyid Muhammad is the master and Yahya the disciple - whatever the former suggests, the latter writes.\n\nRecently a statement hath appeared from these liars claiming that what the Exalted One meant by the year Nine was nine years after the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, at the time of Mustaghath. Observe how far they have strayed from the path of truth and justice! By God, it would be better for the tongue to be struck dumb than to utter such words. These souls are not to be wondered at, for naught but lies, fabrications and calumnies have been heard from them. But what is strange is that the people of the Bayan give ear to such nonsensical talk. Shame upon them and upon their sense of honor and faithfulness!\n\nTheir understanding hath reached such a point that recently they named one as vile as themselves with this Most Great Name, then wrote that if the verses revealed in the Bayan pertain to this Name, then so-and-so was also called by this Name. May God curse them! He shall soon return them to their abode in the abyss where they shall find no friend to help them.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and commit not that which neither Pharaoh, nor Haman, nor Nimrod, nor Shaddad committed. God hath sent Me and dispatched Me unto you with clear signs that confirm what ye possess of God's Books and Scriptures and what was revealed in the Bayan. Your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, hath testified to My truth. Fear God, then be fair in His Cause. The Manifestation of God is better for you, did ye but know.\n\nStrange it is that souls who remain veiled from this Manifestation are not ashamed, yet raise objections against other religions. Glory be to Thy Lord, the All-Glorious, above what they say! Yes, the previous Manifestation foretold what has come to pass. Consider the state of those souls who, despite these wondrous verses, divine manifestations and holy attributes that have encompassed the world, and despite the testimony of the Exalted One Who throughout the Bayan took a covenant and gave glad tidings to those seeking the Ka'bah of their Goal, still declare \\[...\\]\n\nAnd they give glad tidings to those seeking the Kaaba of their desire, saying \"Go and see so-and-so.\" Strange indeed are such souls. Time has brought me low, brought me low, until what is said is said. Apart from all these considerations, they mention the false and fabricated words of one who associates partners with God in opposition to God's mighty verses and holy divine evidences. This is exactly like someone saying: \"You have inhaled the rose-fragrance of God's paradise; now inhale also the stench of a putrid corpse.\" Some maintain that after this Most Great Manifestation, that polytheistic soul should not utter fabricated words. This statement is exactly like someone saying that in the presence of truth, nothing else should be mentioned; or that with the appearance of justice, oppression should not be witnessed; or that when the sweet fragrance of the roses in the All-Merciful's garden wafts, foul odors should not be smelled. These are objections that the veiled ones of no religion have ever raised. Say: O ye who wander lost in the valley of heedlessness! Your tongues confess that \"God was, and there was nothing else besides Him, and now He is as He was,\" even though all created things are visible and existent. Despite the existence of all things, you testify that Truth has been and will be, and naught else has been or will be. Now bear this same testimony regarding this Manifestation and all that relates to it, and behold all else as perishing, non-existent and lost. This station has been and will be for those possessed of true vision and insight. Reflect, O people of the Bayan, that perchance ye may distinguish between the buzzing of flies and the verses of the Lord of Lords. By the Beloved of all horizons! The words of the opposers have been and will be utter nothingness compared to the Primal Word. Did not the previous Manifestation declare that the verses of each soul are witnessed at his own level? Strange that they have read the Bayan for years yet have not grasped a single letter of it. They are exactly like the people of the Furqan (Quran), nay these polytheists are without compare. The former polytheists, when opposing the Seal of the Prophets, did not resort to such arguments - for none said \"Why were not the tongues of poets silenced when they composed verses in opposition and hung them up?\" Apart from all these considerations, every person of insight testifies that the fabricated words of those atheistic souls have been and will be as nothing compared to the words of even one of the servants at the gate of the King of Creation. What can be said when people are seen to be as sucklings and immature ones, and have caused the infinite divine bounties to be withheld from creation, and the maidens of inner meanings to remain concealed in spiritual chambers behind the pavilions of divine infallibility? For these souls are strangers and have not had and will not have access to the sanctuary of sacred meanings, save those who return and repent with humility. Say: O people of the Bayan! If you do not comprehend the Arabic verses, then observe the Persian words of Truth and other than Truth, that perchance you may not make yourselves deserving of endless punishment and be not veiled from the Eternal Countenance by mortal souls. By the Sun of the Most Glorious Horizon! All that has been mentioned was for God's sake.\n\nO people, do not veil yourselves with mortal beings from the Eternal Countenance. I swear by the Sun of the Most Glorious Horizon that whatsoever hath been mentioned hath been and shall be for God's sake, and I am commanded thus. Otherwise no benefit accrues to the Sovereign of all possibility from the faith of the dwellers of all worlds. God hath sanctified my garment from all that they possess, for He is indeed the Self-Sufficient above all else, and the Independent of all save Him. I have raised the banner of 'There is no God but He' by His command, and the pavilion of glory of 'There is no God but I' hath been uplifted by His leave. None hath any refuge or shelter save in Him.\n\nO people of Baha! Drink ye this wine of immortality openly in the name of the Most Glorious Beloved, despite the enemies. Leave these fabricated idols to occupy themselves with their own foul and offensive intimations. By My Life! The nostrils of cattle have no share of this most pure fragrance, and this incomparable, flowing, glorious crystal stream was not and never shall be the portion of the people of error.\n\nYet the people of the Bayan have not reflected upon the objections raised by previous peoples at the time of Manifestation, although extensive Tablets have been revealed from the Supreme Pen regarding this matter. Would that they had considered and become aware. Certain Persian Tablets were revealed and sent in response to some of the loved ones. Although it is regrettable that the words of this Most Great Revelation should be beheld by veiled, idolatrous, and rejected souls, nevertheless, for the sake of teaching God's Cause, there is no harm if your honor should show them to some. However, \"None shall touch it save the purified ones.\" This is the wine of inner meanings of this Revelation, which was previously mentioned as the \"sealed wine\" in the sacred words, sealed with the seal of protection. All the idolaters observe and read, yet they have not attained even a drop thereof.\n\nSay: O people of the Bayan! At least observe the Persian Bayan, that perchance ye may not dare to approach that station wherein the Primal Point hath mentioned naught but utter nothingness and absolute extinction. The Cause of God hath reached such a state that the essence of error, who is called Hadi, hath become the guide of people and hath girded up his loins in opposition. If the people of the Bayan would consider the utterances of Yahya, Siyyid Muhammad, Hadi, A?raj, and their like, and would also reflect upon the words of the servants of this Gate, by God, they would surely find the truth and cast away falsehood. But what benefit, when the eye is impure and the heart is veiled?\n\nLet someone say to Hadi that if thou hadst the least discernment, thou wouldst testify that whatsoever was mentioned in the name of that fabricated person was for the sake of wisdom in the Cause. Reflect a little on the beginning of these matters, that perchance thou mayest attain to that which was hidden from eyes and become convinced that that person was non-existent from the beginning. Divine wisdom and exigencies required what appeared and became known.\n\nWe beseech God that if such souls have not been guided, may He, glorified be His greatness, raise up holy temples from the pure essence of His Cause in such wise that they may regard all in the world as non-existent and void, and see none as existing, speaking, uttering, and powerful save the Truth. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. God willing, may your honor, through the wondrous grace of the Lord of Lords, become the breaker of the idols of vain desire.\n\nAnd behold ye not the power? Verily, He is potent over whatsoever He willeth. God willing, that soul shall, through the wondrous grace of the Lord of Lords, become a breaker of the idols of vain desire and a kindler of the fire of guidance. O how blessed art thou for having attained unto the Most Glorious Station and for having turned thy gaze unto the Most Exalted Horizon! He chooseth whom He willeth through His grace, and He is verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, the Lord of the Last and the First. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.\n\nAs to thy question concerning the difference between Qayyum and Qa'im, know thou that the difference between these two names is as that between the Most Great and the Great. This is what My Beloved hath explained aforetime, and We have mentioned it in a wondrous Book. By this He intended naught save to inform the people that He Who shall appear is greater than what hath appeared, and that He is the Qayyum over the Qa'im. This is the truth to which the Tongue of the All-Merciful beareth witness in the heaven of utterance. Know thou this and be independent of all the worlds. Then shall the Qa'im cry out from the right hand of the Throne, saying: \"O people of the Bayan! By God, this is indeed the Qayyum Who hath come unto you with a manifest sovereignty. This is the Most Great One before Whose countenance every great and greater one hath prostrated. The Most Great Name was exalted only to magnify Him at the manifestations of His sovereignty, and the Qayyum prevailed only through His effacement in His court. Thus was the matter ordained, but the people are veiled therefrom.\n\n\"Can aught be more explicit than that which was revealed in the Bayan concerning this Revelation? Yet behold what the idolaters have wrought! Say: O people, this is the Qayyum Who hath fallen under your nails. If ye show Him no mercy, then have mercy upon yourselves. By the True One! This is the Beauty of the All-Known, through Whom hath appeared that which was inscribed upon a preserved tablet. Beware lest ye cleave unto the imagined one who hath disbelieved in His presence and His signs and was among the idolaters in a Book inscribed by the finger of truth.\n\n\"Be thou assured that He intended naught save the greatness of this Revelation over both the mentioned and the concealed, and the exaltation of this Name above all names, and His sovereignty over all who are in earth and heaven, and His grandeur and power over all things. Through His manifestation all created things have testified that He is the One manifest above all things, and through His concealment all atoms have testified that He is the One hidden, sanctified from all things. He is called by the name 'the Manifest' for He is seen through His names and attributes and is known as the One besides Whom there is no God. And He is called by the name 'the Hidden' for He cannot be described by any description nor known by what is mentioned, since what is mentioned is His creation in the world of remembrance. Exalted is He above being known through remembrance or perceived through thought! His outward appearance is His very hiddenness. When He is called by His name 'the Manifest,' He is called by His name 'the Hidden.' Verily, He cannot be known through thoughts nor perceived through vision as He is in His transcendent sublimity and exalted sovereignty. He is in the Most Exalted Prospect and the Most Glorious Horizon, and He saith: 'Lost indeed are they who have disbelieved in Him through Whose name the Hidden Scroll was adorned, and the Countenance of Unity appeared, and the Banner of Lordship was raised, and the Pavilion of Divinity was lifted up, and the Sea of Eternity surged, and the hidden Secret veiled in the Most Great Mystery was revealed.' By His life! The Bayan hath failed to describe Him and explanation to know Him. Exalted be this Self-Subsisting One through Whom the imagined veil was rent asunder, the hidden was revealed, and the sealed wine was unsealed. By the All-Merciful Himself! The Bayan lamenteth and saith \\[...\\]\"\n\nO Lord! Thou didst cause me to be revealed for Thy remembrance and Thy praise and the knowledge of Thyself. He Who stood forth by Thy command enjoined the servants not to be veiled by me and by what was created from Thy subsisting Beauty. But the people distorted what was revealed concerning me to establish Thy truth and exalt Thy remembrance. They disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs and made me a shield for themselves, whereby they oppose Thee - this after no word was revealed except that it was revealed to exalt Thy Cause and manifest Thy sovereignty and the loftiness of Thy power and the sublimity of Thy station. Would that I had not been revealed and had not been mentioned! By Thy glory! Were Thou to render me non-existent, it would be better for me than to exist and be recited by Thy servants who have risen to harm Thee and who have intended against Thee what they have intended. I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things to deliver me from these transgressors, that I may speak of Thy beauty, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of power and the dominion of authority. And were We to descend from the Most Exalted Station, the First Point, the Ultimate Tree, and the Most Glorious Horizon, and bring down the utterance from the heights of exposition to the realm of possibility to mention the difference between the two names in terms of numerical value - though My Beauty hidden within Me addresseth Me saying: \"O My Beloved! Turn not Thy gaze from My face, abandon mention and utterance and occupy not Thyself with aught else\" - I say: \"O My Beloved! Thy confirmed decree and ordained destiny have caused Me to descend until I appeared in the garment of the people of all worlds. Therefore it behooveth Me to speak in their tongue and according to what their understanding and minds can comprehend. Were I to change the garment, who could draw nigh? If Thou desirest what Thou commandest of Me, remove the hand of prevention from My mouth. I ask Thy forgiveness for this, O My God and My Beloved! Have mercy then upon Thy servants and send down unto them what their hearts and minds are capable of understanding. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\nKnow thou that the numerical difference is fourteen, which is the number of Baha when counting the hamza as six, since its shape is six in geometric terms. And if thou readest \"Qa'im\" thou wilt find the difference to be five, which is the letter \"ha'\" in \"Baha.\" In this station Qayyum is established upon the throne of His name \"Qa'im\" just as the letter \"ha'\" is established upon the letter \"vav.\" And in one station, if thou countest the hamza of \"Qa'im\" as six according to geometric reckoning, the difference becomes nine, which is also this Name. And by this nine, exalted be His mention, is intended the manifestation of the Nine in this station. This is what thou seest regarding the difference in the outward appearance of the two names. We have indeed abridged the exposition for thee, and if thou wouldst reflect upon what We have mentioned to thee and cast upon thee, thou wouldst derive therefrom that which would solace thine eyes and the eyes of them that have professed the unity of God. By My life! This difference is indeed a mighty sign for those who have soared unto the heaven of Baha. And by what We have demonstrated to thee outwardly, it is established that the inner meaning is the supremacy of the name Qayyum over Qa'im. Know thou this and be of them that preserve. We have veiled this mention and concealed it from the eyes of them that are in the Bayan. Then We unveiled it for thee that thou mayest be of the thankful. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nI will briefly speak in Persian so that all creatures may, through the grace of the King of Oneness, partake and attain to this flowing spring that is neither of the east nor of the west, neither described nor mentioned, neither manifest nor revealed, which has ever been preserved from the taste of the souls of the polytheists. Know thou that the purpose of the Primal Point concerning the distinction between Qayyum and Qayyim, and between A'zam and 'Azim, was that the greatness of the subsequent Manifestation would surpass the 'Azim, and the Qayyumiyyat of the latter Manifestation would transcend the Qa'im. And the distinction between A'zam and 'Azim in the number of Manifestation was nine, as is evident to every person of insight and clear to every informed one. And this greatness and Qayyumiyyat flows and is manifest in this Revelation and what appears from His presence. For example, the purpose of Qayyum was the Manifestation of Nine, and He was made manifest with the name of Baha, and now that greatness which is observed in the outer letters is calculated in one instance as the hamzih of Baha being six and Qa'im being one. Reflect that thou mayest know, and in this are signs for those who know. O questioning observer, I swear by the Beauty of the Beloved that what was intended by the Exalted One in this Revelation and what was recorded by the Most Ancient Pen in the holy scrolls is difficult to mention, and in truth to lift the veil from the face of the Maiden of inner meanings. The Holy Spirit sayeth that if 'Azim should rend asunder the nine veils, he would attain unto A'zam. This is the utterance of the Holy Spirit, and his Lord is witness to what he saith. This utterance is not from Us but from Him. Say: Beware lest ye object. And He ordained these nine as the days of respite between the two Manifestations, so that those essences which were illumined by the Sun of 'Azim might become prepared for the appearance of the Greater Luminary, which all were promised in the year nine. Nevertheless, observe how these human-seeming creatures, by clinging to their vain imaginings, have raised such objections against the King of the known and unknown, and the Sovereign of the unseen and seen. These souls have never tasted a drop from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful's utterance, nor have they understood a single letter of what was intended by the Sovereign of all possibility in what was revealed unto Him. Leave them in their vain disputations, and in this spiritual dawn soar in the subtle atmosphere of inner meanings. The hesitant ones have not hearkened to the Word of the Lord of the Day of Judgment; they are among the people of the graves, and they shall abide forever in the fire, and the fire is their grave, did they but know it.\n\nIn reply to thy question concerning the human spirit after physical death, apart from the Prophets and holy ones - whether the same individuality, personality, consciousness and understanding that existed before death continues to exist afterwards or whether it perishes, and assuming it endures, how is it that during life when harm befalls human faculties through unconsciousness or severe illness, consciousness and understanding vanish, yet after death, which is the dissolution of elements and composition, how can personality and consciousness be conceived when all the instruments have completely disintegrated?\n\nKnow thou that the spirit in its own station remains firm and enduring. The weakness observed in the sick is due to intervening causes, not to any weakness in the spirit itself. Consider the lamp: it is luminous and shining, but if something blocks it, its light is obscured although in its own station it remains luminous - yet due to the intervening cause its light is prevented from shining forth. Likewise, in illness the manifestation of the spirit's power and might is prevented and veiled due to intervening causes, but after its release from the body it appears with such power, might and ascendancy as cannot be imagined. The pure, holy and sanctified spirits have ever possessed and shall continue to possess all power and complete freedom.\n\nFor instance, if a lamp is placed within an iron lantern, its light will not appear outwardly at all, even though it is shining within. Consider the sun behind clouds: in its own station it is bright and luminous, yet due to the intervening clouds its light appears weak. Consider this same sun as the human spirit and all things as its body, which is illumined through that light's effulgence and radiance. But this continues only so long as no intervening causes prevent it or veil it. After being veiled, the sun's light appears weak, just as on cloudy days - though the earth is illumined by sunlight, that illumination is weak. But after the clouds disperse, the sun's rays appear in their full glory, while in both states the sun itself remains the same. Such is the case with the sun of souls, which hath been mentioned and continues to be mentioned by the name of spirit.\n\nSimilarly, observe the weakness of the fruit's existence in the original tree before emerging from it - though within the tree it is so weak as to be completely imperceptible, such that if one were to cut the tree into pieces, not a trace of the fruit or its form would be found. Yet after emerging from the tree it appears with wondrous beauty and mighty strength, as can be observed in fruits, some of which become more delectable after being separated from the tree. Multiple examples have been given that from each similitude thou mayest comprehend the intended meaning and apply it to what thou hast asked of God, thy Lord.\n\nAnd as for what thou hast asked concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds - may His mention be glorified - He is able to manifest and make evident all infinite knowledge through any of the examples mentioned among men. Indeed, the hand of power is outstretched over every example, and the hand of protection placed upon every word. None knoweth this save whom He willeth. When the seal of the perfumed vessel is broken by the hand of might, its fragrance is diffused. The Command is in God's hand - He giveth and withholdeth, blindeth and maketh to see, doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.\n\nAs for what was asked about creation, know that creation hath ever been and shall ever be. No beginning can be imagined for its beginning, nor any end for its ending. The name \"Creator\" itself requireth a creation, just as the name \"Lord\" necessiteth that which is lorded over. As for what was mentioned in previous utterances that \"He was a God and there was none to be worshipped beside Him\" and \"He was a Lord and there was none to be lorded over\" and the like - the meaning thereof is realized in all times. This is the same word which declareth \"God was, and there was nothing else besides Him\" and He shall be as He hath ever been. Every person of insight testifieth that the Lord now existeth while that which is lorded over is non-existent - meaning that His sacred realm transcendeth all else, and whatsoever is mentioned in the realm of contingent being is limited by contingent limitations, while the Truth is sanctified therefrom. He hath ever been, and there was none else with Him - neither name, nor description, nor attribute - and He shall ever be, sanctified from all besides Him.\n\nConsider, for instance, at the time of the manifestation of the universal Manifestation, before that Ancient Being maketh Himself known and uttereth the creative Word, the world existed but none had knowledge of Him. Likewise, He was the Creator but no creation existed with Him, for at that moment the spirit is withdrawn from all to which the name \"thing\" can be applied. This is that Day concerning which He saith \"To whom belongeth the Kingdom this Day?\" and there is none to answer. The tongue of power and majesty proclaimeth \"To God, the One, the All-Compelling!\" Thus is existence negated from all things, for the realization of existence in its primary degree followeth after the attainment of knowledge, and before that the existence of the Ancient Being is realized while the annihilation of all things is established.\n\nBefore His outward manifestation unto all things, He was a Lord and there was none to be lorded over, but after the revelation of the Word and the establishment of the Temple of Oneness upon the Throne of the All-Merciful, whosoever turneth unto Him becometh one who is lorded over, created, and known. The understanding of these stations dependeth upon the recognition of the servants who are endowed with insight and knowledge.\n\nHe hath ever testified that He existeth while all else is non-existent - a God with none to be worshipped beside Him, and a Lord with none to be lorded over in His presence. He was, and there was nothing else besides Him, and He shall be even as He hath ever been. I swear by the Primal Point that the Temple of Oneness, due to the sorrows that have descended and the blocking of the ways through the deception of the souls of the idolaters, hath been prevented from mentioning the hidden, concealed, sublime and elevated stations. Afflictions have descended in such wise that none save God can reckon them, and the Land of Mystery is in secret turmoil, with none aware thereof save thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Soon shall that which is hidden be made manifest. None knoweth this save him who possesseth knowledge of the Book.\n\nAnd concerning the question that was asked about why there is no mention of the Prophets before Adam, the father of mankind, and the kings of those ages in historical books - the absence of mention is not, and has never been, proof of non-existence. Due to the length of time and the revolutions of the earth, these records have not remained. Moreover, before Adam, the father of mankind, the rules of writing and customs that exist now among people did not exist. There was a time when there was no system of writing at all; other methods were practiced. Were we to explain this in detail, the discourse would be prolonged.\n\nConsider the differences that emerged after Adam: in the beginning, these known languages mentioned were not present on earth, nor were these established rules. They spoke in a language other than these mentioned tongues. The diversity of languages occurred in the land known as Babel, after which that land was called Babel, meaning \"where the tongue was confused,\" that is, where it became different. Afterward, the Syriac language was respected among people, and the divine books were revealed in that tongue until the time when the Friend of the All-Merciful appeared from the horizon of possibility with divine lights. When that holy being crossed the river Jordan, He spoke in a tongue that was called Hebrew - it was named Hebrew because the Friend of the All-Merciful spoke it while crossing. Subsequently, divine books and scrolls were revealed in Hebrew. Time passed, and it was transformed into Arabic. The first to speak it was Ya'rub ibn Qahtan, the first to write in Arabic was Maramir at-Ta'i, and the first to compose poetry was Himyar ibn Saba. Then the written forms were transferred from one script to another until they reached this known script.\n\nNow observe how many languages, expressions, and systems of writing have changed since Adam, let alone before Adam. The purpose of these statements is that the Truth has ever been, in Its supreme inaccessibility and exalted sanctity, sanctified above the mention of all else, and ever shall be. Creation has always existed, and the Manifestations of the glory of the Divine Unity and Dawning-places of eternal holiness have been sent forth in the primordial centuries, calling creation to the Truth. However, due to the changes and transformations in the conditions of the world, some names and mentions have not remained.\n\nThe flood is mentioned in books, and in that event, everything that was upon the earth was drowned, whether books of history or otherwise. Similarly, many revolutions have occurred that caused the erasure of certain temporal matters. Beyond these considerations, contradictions are evident in the historical books existing on earth, and among different nations there are various accounts of the age of the world and recorded events. Some have histories of eight thousand years, some more, some twelve thousand years, and if one has seen the book of Juk, one would know how many contradictions exist between books.\n\nOne should, God willing, gaze upon the Greatest Horizon and remove one's attention from all these differences and mentions. Today the realities of the Manifestations of the Cause are adorned with the Most Glorious ornament and are visible, and all names are manifest in the New Name, and all realities are concealed in His reality. Whoso believeth in Him hath believed in God.\n\nAll names are manifest in His wondrous Name, and all realities lie hidden in His Reality. Whoso believeth in Him hath believed in God and in His Manifestations in all ages, and whoso turneth away from Him hath denied God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing. Should anyone ponder upon what hath been mentioned, he will attain unto the purpose. Though revealed with brevity, yet concealed within it are a hundred thousand detailed expositions. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things preserved in a Tablet. We beseech God to grant thee that which He hath ordained for His chosen ones, and to open before thy heart's face the gates of meaning, that thou mayest understand from His words that which He intended. Verily, He is powerful over all things. All praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH00060 ===\n\n=== START BH00061 ===\n\nThis is what hath been sent down from the heaven of eternity unto His servants: some soared unto the heaven of the Cause, and some held back. Even thus have We sent down the Command, as a mercy from Our presence unto Our believing servants. This is the Surih of the Sovereign that hath been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful with perspicuous and mighty and ancient verses. He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious. These are the verses of God that have in truth been sent down from the heaven of eternity, which God hath made a testimony from Him and a proof from His presence unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, from this day until the Day when the standards of dissension shall be obliterated and the Luminary of the horizons shall shine forth from the Dayspring of His Name, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Then shall the eyes of them that disbelieved and joined partners with God be dazzled, and souls shall be perturbed, and all who dwell in the kingdoms of Command and Creation shall be overcome with drunkenness, such that they shall place the fingers of bewilderment between their teeth, all that was and that shall be. And therein shall the inmost secrets of every soul that liveth be tried, if ye be of them that comprehend.\n\nSay: O people, fear God Who created you and provided for you and made you great ones in the earth and sent down from heaven that which causes the earth to yield sacred and impregnable fruits. Beware, O concourse of earth, be not ungrateful for God's favor and differ not in His Cause. Follow that which hath been sent down to you from the heaven of Command as verses of wondrous might. O people! The relief hath come to you from God, your Lord, and He commandeth you to righteousness and piety and forbiddeth you from all that leadeth you to desires. Fear God and be among the God-fearing. Say: Verily your relief is in the establishment of this Beauty upon the throne of manifest glory, if ye be of those who know. Say: He hath appeared in such wise that all the worlds are bewildered at His sovereignty, yet ye have not recognized the relief that was promised to you in all the Tablets and ye are among the heedless. Say: By God! Were ye to ponder upon the Cause of Him Who hath appeared in truth, ye would witness the relief from your Lord, the All-Merciful, in that which floweth from this luminous, mighty and impregnable Pen. Therefore, O people, examine your souls that ye may perchance recognize your Creator in these days wherein none among all created things hath recognized Him save whom your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, hath willed. Nay rather, the idolaters have risen against Him and dispute with Him concerning God's verses and object to that which hath been revealed unto Him, even as the people of the Furqan objected against God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, at the time when the clouds of grace were rent asunder and the Beauty of the Ancient of Days appeared from behind them in the name of Ali with clear and mighty signs. O people! By God, she whom I created with the hand of My will hath rebelled against Me even as Pharaoh rebelled before God, your Lord and the Lord of all creatures, and said \"I am your lord, the most high\" though he was powerless to create even a fly upon the earth, as every person of insight doth testify. And he whom I created by My word hath objected to Me in such wise that the heavens and earth have wept, and after them the eyes of those who circle round the sanctuary of grandeur with crimson tears, and behind them the eyes of the holy ones. Say: The Son of Mary ascended unto the mountain of the Command and the holy clouds enveloped him. Then he witnessed drops of blood upon His garment and was bewildered within himself and inquired about it, being among the questioners. The cloud informed him of that which would befall the Youth. Thereupon he cried out within his soul and detached himself from the world and all that is therein and ascended to the holy seat before God, his Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of the worlds. Were I to utter a word about that which befell Him, verily the veil of the pavilion of grandeur would be rent asunder, the pillars of the House would crumble, and the supports of the mighty throne would shake. But We have concealed it and been patient until God shall come with the authority of His triumph and make known His beauty between the heavens and the earths. Then know that when the idolaters witnessed the signs of God, they objected to them and denied that which they had believed in before, and thereby their deeds were rendered vain though they perceived it not and were among the heedless. Therefore all atoms and all that lay behind the veils of power curse them while they sit at their places sporting and being among the joyous. Thus doth God reveal the secrets of hearts and the treachery of those who profess faith with their tongues while denying Him by Whose command the measures of faith were ordained from the presence of One mighty and wise.\n\nThey deny Him by Whose command the measures of faith were ordained from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Among them are those who turned away and transgressed in their souls, openly rebelling against God, and were among the idolaters. And among them are those who sought to plot against God's Cause and thereby instill hatred of the Youth in the hearts of the believers, to make them slip from the path and distance them from the holy, luminous shore. Thus did they gather together according to what Satan whispered in their hearts and plotted a plot. God will soon expose their plotting to whoever follows the command of his Lord and possesses insight from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. And among them is he who was confident that if he opposed the Youth, those who followed him in his hatred would also oppose Him, for he sees leadership within himself. Say: Woe unto you, O company of deniers! God has servants whom neither hints nor signs can prevent, whom no hindrance can hinder nor any opposition deter, even if all creation were to unite against them. These are they whom the signs of the past concerning the mention of the Resurrection did not deter, nor were they prevented by what was revealed in the Furqan concerning \"He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.\" They rent asunder those veils through the sovereignty of power from Our presence and entered the holy sanctuary, the seat of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, with manifest sincerity. They acknowledged within themselves that prophethood shall never be cut off from this moment unto the end that has no end. Thus did the Spirit breathe into their hearts the spirit of certitude from the presence of the Mighty, the Beautiful. These know God through God and through what appears from His presence. They shield their sanctified ears from the croaking of the idolaters, even if they be among the great ones and nobles of the people, for their nobility lies in following the command of their Creator and prostrating themselves before God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nSay: O people, fear God and dispute not about God's verses, nor refute the truth with what you possess. Be ashamed before Him Who created you by His word. Fear God, O people, and be not among the wrongdoers. And if you believe not in Him Who has come to you from the dawning-place of the Spirit with verses that prove what you possess, do not fabricate lies against Him and be not among the fabricators. O people of the Bayan! By God, this is indeed the truth that is being recited unto you from the verses of God. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and be among the fair-minded. If you object to what is now being revealed unto you, by what proof can your souls find rest and be among the tranquil? Say: No one's faith or deeds shall be accepted today except through following this firm, mighty, and wise Cause. And if you believe not, God shall soon raise up a people and cause them to hear the melodies of the Cause and enter them into this Paradise which God has made the sign of His grandeur between the heavens and the earths. These shall know their Creator through His Self and through what has been revealed from His presence from the verses of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Conquering, the Luminous. They shall leave behind all that the people possess, even if it be the books of the first and the last. Verily, those who have recognized the sovereignty of the sea, its depths and its pearls - would they turn to mere waves? Nay, by your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, if you be of those who know. And he who has drunk from the Kawthar of holiness from the hand of the celestial youths - would he be content with brackish water? Nay, by your Lord, the Merciful, if you be of those who are certain. And whoever has known the Sun will never occupy himself with its shadows. Thus do We cast upon your hearts that which will draw you near to God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, that perchance the people of insight might ascend above the dust.\n\nWhoso hath recognized the Sun will never occupy himself with its shadows. Thus do We cast upon your hearts that which shall draw you nigh unto God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Most High, the Inaccessible, that perchance the people of understanding may ascend from the dust and rise unto the heaven of righteousness, the seat of mighty glory. And when thou reachest thy land, the city which hath been named after My name, the Sovereign, give glad-tidings unto it and unto them that have believed in that which the Pen of Holiness hath moved upon them from the finger of God, that ye may be of them that are filled with gladness. Say: O people! Ye were asleep upon the cushions of ease while the Temple of the Cause was crying out and lamenting. O people! Aid ye God and His Cause in these days, and hesitate not in aught, and be ye of them that help. And verily His help is to teach His Cause amongst the servants and to remain steadfast in His love in these days wherein the pillars of them that know have been made to tremble. O people! Exchange not the favor of God amongst you, nor deny that whereby your faith in God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful, the All-Compelling, may be established. Fear ye God, O people, and cast not the Cause of God behind your backs, nor follow the footsteps of Satan. O people! If ye deny the Sovereign of the Cause, then by what countenance will ye turn in these days when the dust of fire hath enveloped most of the servants, and intoxication hath seized the dwellers of the heavens and the earth, save them that have relied upon God and have detached themselves from all things, and have held fast unto the cord of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nO Most Great Spirit! Make mention in the Book of Abul-Qasim who journeyed unto God and was touched on the way by the hardships of exile, that he may rejoice within himself and remain steadfast in the Cause of his Lord at a time wherein the feet of every man of knowledge and insight have slipped. O servant! Grieve not for anything, and turn not unto them that have disbelieved and turned away and were in manifest heedlessness. Be patient in what hath befallen thee, then put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and the Lord of all things, and the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO Faraj! If thou passest not by thy home, send thou this Tablet unto Our near servants. We have made this Tablet as the garment of the Cause that the fragrance of the Youth may waft therefrom upon all created things, that perchance God may raise up thereby a people who will see naught save God, their Lord, and whom the allusions of them that turn aside will not debar, that perchance Our servant Abraham may find from this garment the sweet savors of holiness and may arise to establish the Cause between the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Abraham! Step forth from behind the veil of silence in My Name, the Speaker, the Utterer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O friend! Sanctify thyself from all allusions, then raise thy call of the Spirit between earth and heaven, that perchance thereby the fire may be kindled in the breasts of the righteous, and they may arise to serve the Cause with a sovereignty from Us and a command from Our presence. Verily, I am the Omnipotent over what I will, and I am the Bestower, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Merciful.\n\nArise to serve God and aid His Cause, and fear no one. This is God's command unto thee, decreed by the Pen of might and clarity. Say: Today nothing shall profit anyone, even if he should bring forth all the scriptures of heaven and earth, except that he enter beneath the shadow of his Lord, the Most High, in this His latter Manifestation. By God! This is His Beauty in truth, His Manifestation in the kingdom of command and creation, and His sovereignty amongst all created things.\n\nSay: O people! Do ye write of the Bayan while denying Him Who revealed it? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! Do ye make mention of God, then seek to slay His very Self? Alas for you, O company of the idolaters! Say: He hath appeared in these days in such wise that all necks have bowed before Him, if ye be of them that know. The Cause of God hath been manifested through His own Self alone, as ye have heard and were among them that hearkened. Say: By God! The Cause hath shone forth like the sun at high noon, and none shall deny it save every blind and accursed one.\n\nO friend! Strip thyself of the allusions of the people, then adorn thy temple with the raiment of resplendent glory, for We have made thee the herald of Our Cause in that land, that thou mayest acquaint the people with that which the Spirit hath inspired in thee from Our presence, and be of wondrous remembrance. By My beauty! He in whose heart there is love for aught created between the heavens and the earth shall never be able to bear this firm, mighty, and exalted Cause. Purify thyself with this heavenly stream which floweth from the fountainhead of eternity, then purify therewith the hearts of the seekers. Therefore, rejoice within thyself that We have named thee the herald of the Cause. Then circulate the crimson wine in My Most Glorious Name between earth and heaven, that through it may be quickened the spirits of those who, when the verses of their Lord, the Most High, are recited unto them, fall prostrate upon their faces in the dust in humility before God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nKnow thou that whatsoever thou hast heard regarding this Cause hath appeared by My command, and all else was created by My word, and none hath known this save My All-Knowing, All-Informed Self. When We desired to exalt the Cause among the peoples of old, We made reference in Our utterances to others besides Ourself, as a wisdom from Us, for We were the Ruler. We raised the Cause to such a station that ye heard of its spread and exaltation until the Word and mention thereof filled the heavens and earth. But when the Cause appeared and emerged, then shone forth and dawned, there rose against Me those servants who were created by My command, and thus were they among the transgressors.\n\nO herald of the Cause! Those who concealed their faces behind veils out of fear for themselves, when the breezes of assurance wafted forth, emerged like serpents. Thus do We recount unto thee that which was hidden from the eyes of the beholders, that thou mayest be apprised of what hath befallen My Beauty and be among the knowing ones. Blessed art thou, O herald of the Cause, for having attained unto the presence of the Throne at the time when the Sun of the horizons shone forth from the direction of Iraq. By God! Thereby hast thou attained unto that which none other hath attained.\n\nWell-pleasing shall it be unto thee, O herald of the Cause, for thou hast attained unto the presence before the Throne at an hour when the Sun of the horizons dawned forth from the region of Iraq. By God! Thereby hast thou attained unto that which none hath attained, and this is a revelation from One Who is mighty and all-knowing. Give thanks unto God for having blessed thee with attainment unto His presence and for having aided thee to visit the Manifestation of His Self in days which no servant hath recognized, having been seized by vain imaginings and been in manifest heedlessness. Know thou that Satan shall come unto you from the direction of tyranny with that which shall prevent you from the Beauty of the All-Merciful. Then arise in the Cause, cast behind thee what is with him, turn away from him, and turn thy face unto My luminous and mighty and radiant countenance. Say: O Satan! Get thee gone from among the concourse of the Spirit, for We have found from thee the stench of hatred from God, the Mighty, the Generous. And thou hast borne, O accursed one, that whereby all who are in the heavens and earth curse thee, and the dwellers of the kingdom of Command and Creation, and all that was and that shall be. But thou wast heedless of that and wast among the negligent. By God! Thou hast passed by naught except that it cursed thee with its inner tongue, but since thou wast deaf, thou heardst not its call and wast among the ignorant. Thus do We recount unto thee tidings of the unseen, that ye may be assured that with Us is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of all things in preserved and mighty tablets.\n\nO Tongue of Eternity! Make mention of Husayn in the Book and give him glad tidings of the lights of the Throne, that it may cause him to turn towards the direction of eternity, the scene of his Lord, the Most High, and draw him nigh unto the shore of paradise, the station wherein the fire was kindled from the Tree of the Chosen One, and which speaketh that there is none other God but I, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful. O servant! How long wilt thou be negligent regarding thyself? Then be thou enkindled with this fire and proclaim among the righteous that which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful, hath taught thee. Beware lest ye differ among yourselves and cast the Cause of God behind your backs. Be ye among the people as the lights of the sun, such that your faces may shine among the worlds. By God, O servant! Wert thou to become aware of what hath befallen Me of tribulation, thou wouldst weep and lament throughout thy life, and this is a manifest truth. Yet We have veiled the matter lest sorrow encompass the Manifestations of the All-Merciful and consume the hearts of them that are nigh. Therefore have We been patient and veiled the matter lest the veil of concealment be rent asunder from before the face of the worlds.\n\nO Summoner of the Cause! Remember Our servant who hath been named with the first letter of My Name, that he may be thankful in himself and be of the grateful ones. Say: O son! Give thanks unto God for thy father having been martyred in His path and being numbered among the martyrs. By the True God! At the moment when his spirit ascended unto the Supreme Companion, the denizens of the highest paradise received him with crystal goblets and cups filled with the choice wine of paradise, and the hosts of Our exalted realm sought blessings from his presence. Were We to lift the veil from the eyes of men, they would witness his station in the most glorious paradise and would surely sacrifice their lives to attain his transcendent, resplendent, and luminous station. The maidens of paradise vie with each other to serve him, for he is seated at the right hand of paradise, crowned with the crown of immortality from My Most Great and Most Glorious Name. Thus hath the grace of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful, encompassed him. And thou, O son, deprive not thyself of thy portion, for thou hast a station with thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Walk, then, in the footsteps of thy father and follow his guidance, for even were his limbs to be severed, none would find aught therein save My love, as ye have witnessed and were among the witnesses. Thus have We informed thee of that which is hidden from the hearts of men, that thou mayest be steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and be among those who are firmly rooted.\n\nThen make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad-'Ali and give him glad tidings from Us of that wherewith God hath remembered him in the Tablet, and his name hath flowed from the finger of holiness. This is a bounty that no bounty of those who have gone before or will come after can equal, and whosoever attaineth unto this hath attained unto all good from his Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. O servant! Grieve not over the world and its hardships, for whatsoever hath been decreed for the servants in the scrolls of destiny, even though it be adversity, is better for them, were ye of those who understand. For God hath concealed the consequences of matters from the sight of men, and there is no God but Him. He ordaineth what He pleaseth and doeth what He willeth. How often through hardship doth the servant attain to the wellspring of ease, and how often through ease doth hardship overtake him, if ye be of those who observe. For example, wert thou to be in the position of authority and power that thy grandfather occupied, perchance leadership would have prevented thee from guidance. Thus doth the Beauty of Unity cast thee that thou mayest be in joy and wondrous delight in all conditions. Give thanks unto God for having taken from thee that which would have veiled thee from His recognition, for what profiteth the servant is this, and naught else will profit him even were the heavens and earth filled with precious rubies or luminous and holy pearls. By God! That which enricheth the servants in these days is the recognition of their Lord and then the love of the Youth, and besides these two, nothing will nourish or enrich, even were they to possess the treasures of the heavens and earth. Thus doth the Pen of Command admonish thee that thou mayest be steadfast in My love to such an extent that nothing will disturb thee, even wert thou to be struck with sharp swords of steel. Beware! Arise to serve God with such steadfastness that even if all who are in the heavens and earth were to rise against thee, thy feet would not slip from the path of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By God! Should anyone in these days arise in My love and all on earth contend with him, God would assuredly cause him to triumph over them, for the spirit of power hath wafted from the direction of might upon those who are single-hearted. Then convey the Command of thy Lord with spirit and fragrance in such wise that no mischief will occur in the land, for it would recoil upon the root of the Tree, were ye of those who understand.\n\nThen remind Ya'qub with wondrous remembrances from his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: The sight of Ya'qub was restored by the fragrance of the garment from Joseph the Mighty, and he was among those who saw. And verily We have sent unto thee the garment of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, in the form of a Tablet, that thou mayest discover from it the holy fragrances and that the sight of thy heart may be gladdened, such that thou wilt witness the lights of a mighty throne and remain steadfast in the love of thy Lord in days wherein the very essence of tranquility and constancy is shaken, the mountains of idle fancies are leveled, and the veil of the deluded is rent asunder. Then thou shalt find the Concourse of the Bayan intoxicated with the command, and the whips of the command shall seize them from all directions while they rejoice within themselves and are among the heedless. At that time pay no heed to them, but flee unto God Who created you and fashioned you, then take your seat on the right hand in a secure station of glory.\n\nO My loved ones! Adorn your bodies with the raiment of courtesy and justice, and do not commit that which your minds and conscience abhor. Fear God and be among the God-fearing. And thou, O Ya'qub, if thou wouldst behold with the eye of the heart the garment of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst find it reddened with the blood of hatred by the arrows of the wicked, and God beareth witness that ye are among the heedless concerning it.\n\nThen We sent Our mercy from the direction of eternity to him who was named Rahmat'u'llah that he might be merciful unto himself and be among the merciful ones. And verily his mercy toward himself is the recognition of his Lord - this is the foundation of mercy. Have ye seen anything better than this? Nay, by the Self of Baha, were ye of those who are certain!\n\nO servant! Prevent not the winds of thy Lord's mercy from blowing upon thyself, nor the breezes of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, from wafting over thine own being. Cast behind thee every remembrance, then hold fast to the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing. And if harm toucheth thee, grieve not but reflect upon My harm and say as I say: \"O Lord! Harm hath touched me, and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.\" And if adversity befalleth thee, be patient and say as I say: \"O Lord! Pour forth upon me patience, for Thou art the best of helpers.\" And if decree afflicteth thee, show forth patience and say: \"O Lord! Send down upon me mercy, for Thou art the best of those who send down.\"\n\nO Ancient Beauty! Shine forth from the direction of eternity with the effulgence of Thy Most Glorious Name upon him who was named Muhammad in the kingdom of names, that he may be attracted within himself by what hath seized him of the revelation of the Cause from the direction of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful. O servant! Were there a thousand souls within thee and thou wert to sacrifice them all for having thy name flow from the Pen of God, it would still be more insignificant than anything else in the presence of this mighty grace. And if thou wouldst sharpen thy vision, thou wouldst witness that nothing whatsoever that hath been created in the heavens and on earth can equal it. Beware lest thou forget the grace of thy Lord or be among the doubters in thy Lord's religion. Stand firm in the Cause, then be steadfast and be not disturbed by the cawing of the polytheists. Soon shall the clamor of the Samaritan and then the cry of the calf be raised among the worlds. Thus do We inform you with the truth that ye may be apprised of what shall appear among creation and that the breezes of the polytheists may not veil you.\n\nThen let another effulgence shine upon him who is named Ismail, that he may be revived by the gentle breezes of his Lord and be among those who rejoice. O Zabih! Guard thyself from all that thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, abhorreth. Turn not to the world and its ornaments and what hath been ordained therein, for these shall profit thee nothing. Rather, what shall profit thee is that which hath been ordained for thee on tablets of sublime glory. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of the sacred sanctuary, or thy soul of the Kaaba of intimate communion, or thy tongue of the remembrance of God, the Triumphant, the Almighty, the Powerful. O servant! Weep thou for the Self of God and His loneliness, then for His tribulations and exile in this land from which the feet of seekers have been cut off. Say: O people! Have mercy upon Him Who aided you when ye were in manifest abasement and fear, Who stood alone among the enemies and helped you with the hosts of the unseen. Thus was His help ever nigh unto the believers. Beware, O people, lest when ye feel secure in yourselves, ye transgress your bounds and contend with your Lord, the Merciful, or dispute that which hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of a mighty Name. O people! Refute not the truth with what ye possess. By God! All that whereby ye seek to prove your case hath proceeded from My tongue and flowed from My All-Knowing, All-Wise Pen. Beware lest ye seize Me because of this, for the Most Great Spirit speaketh within My breast and the Spirit of Eternity moveth the Pen of Baha as He pleaseth. This is from Him, nay, from One All-Knowing, All-Informed. By God! Were the matter in My hands, I would have veiled My face from all who are on earth and would have departed from among these people and dwelt upon a mountain where My name would not be mentioned among My loved ones, much less among these heedless ones. By God! Whenever I desire to remain silent about wondrous remembrances, the Spirit of Remembrance speaketh within My being, raiseth Me up to His Cause, and strengtheneth Me at all times.\n\nO My brother, who hast slandered Me after I reared thee by Mine own self and protected thee from the harm of the worlds! How many were the nights when thou didst rest in comfort upon thy bed while I kept vigil around thy house as one of thy protectors! How many were the days when thou didst dwell at ease with thy wives while I stood before the presence of the oppressors lest harm touch thee or aught befall thee that would grieve thee and cause thee to be among the sorrowers! Yet despite all this, thou didst secretly plot behind My back, seeking to find occasion against Me and to do that which would shake the pillars of a mighty throne. We would send to various lands to bring before thee that which would gladden thy soul and bring joy to thy being, that thou mightest be among those who rejoice. Yet at every moment thou didst seek to harm Me, to such extent that if thou couldst find someone to whom thou couldst confide, thou wouldst impart that which would consume the hearts of the concourse of the worlds. By God! I was aware of all this, yet after this knowledge We concealed what thou wert doing - thus was thy Lord All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. By God! Through what flowed from thy pen regarding morals, the faces of glory fell prostrate in the dust, the veil of grandeur was rent in the Ridvan of eternity, and the hearts of those near to God were convulsed, until thou didst journey with Me on this journey which caused tears to flow down the radiant cheeks of the dwellers in the exalted chambers of glory. Despite all thou didst ask of Me and seek My permission for, I spoke not a word, for I perceived in thee what none else in the worlds had perceived. When thou didst journey and enter this land, thou didst rise against Me every day, nay every hour. By God! No spot remained in My body that was not struck by the arrows of thy schemes. If thou wouldst deny this, the Tongue of God, the Sovereign, the All-Knowing, would bear witness. Until thou didst slander Me without any proof or clear book. When these emigrants learned of this, their cries and lamentations were raised while thou wert in thy house in great comfort and delight. When We witnessed thy deed and what flowed from thy pen, We departed from among you alone, with no helper or supporter, such that there was none to serve Me or cook for these children what had been ordained for them from the Kingdom of their Lord, the Giving, the Bountiful, the Merciful. Yet even after this thou didst not rest, but spread throughout the land thy deeds in My name to instill rancor in the hearts of the loved ones, and there issued from thy tongue and pen that which the Pen of the Most High would be ashamed to recount. Hear then what was revealed before: \"If thou stretch out thine hand to slay Me, I shall not stretch out Mine hand to slay thee. God is witness to what I say.\" O My brother! By God, thou and those with thee shall perish and return to dust, while sovereignty remaineth with God, the Almighty, the Powerful. By God, O My brother! I harbor no hatred for thee nor for any created thing in My heart. Therefore hear My words, purify thyself, and be not of the heedless. Even if thou remainest as thou art and all in the heavens and earth were to bow down before thee, would it profit thee in any way? Nay, by My Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!\n\nBy My Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! Should all mankind abhor Me, would that benefit thee in any way? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Ancient of Days! Then would My Pen weep, and Mine eye, and all things, wert thou to be of them that observe. Cast behind thee the world and its adornments, and let not authority divert thee from the remembrance of thy Lord and from showing humility before God's God-fearing servants. Yet with all this thou wast not content, until thou didst write to the chief of the city with such abasement as brought low Mine honor amongst all created things. Then thou didst ally thyself with him who hateth thee and who hateth Me, and didst hear with thine own ears that of which thou didst complain to My face, and thou wast among the complainers. When he arose in enmity against Me and the fire of malice was kindled in his heart, thou didst take him as thy helper, and thus wast thou among the doers thereof. Soon shall be made manifest to thee what lieth in his heart, for God hath decreed that He shall reveal it in truth, and He, verily, doeth whatsoever He willeth. By God, O My brother, if thou wert fair in thy judgment, thou wouldst weep over thyself and over Me, and would lament in thy days, and be among those who repent unto God Who created thee by His command. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are recorded in sacred and exalted Tablets with Him. Look to the beginning of time - did he who slew his elder brother, who was named Abel, remain upon the earth? Nay, by God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Wise! Rather, he returned to dust, then God raised him up in truth and questioned him about his deed, then returned him to his abode. Thus observe this matter, then ponder upon it, and be of them that reflect. Beware lest thou be veiled from what We have bestowed upon thee from the Kingdom of Names, for verily it was created by Our command, and We were indeed the Commander of all things.\n\nO Most Great Beauty! Move the Pen in remembrance of Thy Lord, then purify it from the mention of aught else but Him. Take heed lest thou occupy thyself with anyone else, and be thou engaged in the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. Then behold him who standeth before the Cause with the glances of Thy glorious and tender mercy, the Mighty, the Protector, the All-Encompassing - he who was named Ali after Sha'ban - that he may arise from his slumber and be of those who remember. Say: O servant! The Lote-Tree of Remembrance hath been raised up in this wise Remembrance, and the leaves, suspended and stirring upon its branches, proclaim that there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Peerless, and that this is the Splendor of God between the heavens and the earth, and His Light in the dominion of Command and Creation, and His sovereignty over what hath been and what shall be, were ye of those who know. Through Him hath shone forth the Sun of Glory and Majesty, and the faces of those near unto God have been illumined. Were it not for Him, nothing would have appeared in creation, nor would the Spirit have spoken upon the branch of eternity that there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. O servant! Adorn thyself with My attributes, then walk in My ways, and this is indeed a bounty wherewith no other bounty in the worlds can compare. Then adorn thy tongue with truthfulness and thy temple with the robe of justice, if thou be of them that act. Thus doth the One mighty in power teach thee from the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Then adorn the temple of the Friend with the robe of thy Lord's remembrance, the Glorious, that he may shatter the idols of vain desire through My supreme and most exalted sovereignty, and be of the steadfast in the days wherein the souls of those who are settled upon the thrones of names shall be shaken, and every possessor of authority shall set aside his authority, and thou shalt see mankind drunken from the thunderbolt of the Command. Thus do We cast upon thee from the holy verses that thou mayest be of those who know. Be thou steadfast, O servant, in the love of God and the Manifestation of His Self, and this is the foundation of religion, if thou be of them that act. Abandon self and desire, then soar with the wings of holiness in this atmosphere which hath encompassed the worlds. Take heed lest thy tongue be veiled by the veil of falsehood, for it debaseth man among all created things. Say: O people! Fulfill that which ye have covenanted, and deprive not the poor of what ye possess, for by this the good is withheld from the cloud of exalted bounty. Then follow what hath been ordained for you in the Book and be ye in deed more than in word. By God! This is My way and the way of the sanctified ones. Say: O people! The glances of God have turned toward you, yet ye turn not your sight to Him; thus are ye in grievous heedlessness. The face of God hath shone forth above your heads - beware lest ye withhold your eyes from gazing upon it, for this is a bounty that was great before the throne. The Kingdom of God hath risen before your faces - beware lest ye deprive yourselves of its shade and be not of the heedless. Thus doth the Sovereign of the Cause command you with that which is better for you than whatsoever hath been created in the worlds.\n\nO Herald of the Cause! Command him who hath been named Rida to direct the mirror of his heart unto the Most Sublime Vision of God, this most pure and most manifest station, and to be of them that are assured. Say: O servant! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through Our power, then enter the Law of certitude. Know ye that all peoples have been veiled by the veil of fancy from time immemorial. When We desired to rend them asunder, We sent forth a Manifestation from among the Manifestations of Our Self to tear apart the veils of creation by the power of the All-Merciful. Thereupon, an outcry was raised between the heavens and the earth, and the souls of the idolaters were struck with terror, until God established the truth through His signs and brought to naught the deeds of them that were veiled from the beauty of the Cause and were among the heedless. And though naught existed between them save fancy, its rending proved grievous unto them and they were among them that cried out. In those days We raised up all fancies in human form and adorned them with the garment of one of Our names. We then caused their mention to become renowned among men, and thus were We the doer thereof. But when he waxed proud before God his Lord, and contended and disputed with Him, We stripped from him the garment of names and caused him to appear as a handful of clay. Blessed, then, is he who rendeth asunder this most great veil, the like of which hath not appeared in the dominion of the worlds. Glad tidings unto the soul whom the pride of fancy hindereth not, and who rendeth it asunder with the fingers of power from one mighty and powerful. Joy unto him whom the veils of glory prevent not from entering beneath the shadow of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and who is of them that have cast behind them all that would veil them from the remembrance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.\n\nO Ancient Pen in the most great dominion! Move, by thy Lord's leave, to make mention of him who hath been named 'Ali-Khan, that the breezes of the All-Merciful may attract him from this Garden whose leaves proclaim that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Just, the Peerless, the All-Wise. Hearken unto that which the Most Great Spirit singeth in the ancient dominion, that thereby thy soul may find repose and thou mayest be of them whom the joy of the Cause hath seized from every direction, and who are among them that rejoice. O people! Be as lights of the countenance among the servants and as manifestations of the Cause throughout the lands, that through you may appear the signs of God amidst His creation and His power amongst all creatures. Beware! Adorn yourselves with the virtues of God and His Cause, and be distinguished from all others. Then will your connection to your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, prove true. Otherwise, the decree of existence shall not prove true for any soul, how much less this most exalted and glorious station. Thus doth the Pen of Counsel counsel you from one mighty and generous.\n\nO Summoner! Summon from Our presence Our servant Solomon and give him glad tidings of the Spirit of the All-Merciful, that he may be of those who rejoice. O Solomon! Guard thyself from the manifestations of Satan, then build the Most Holy Temple with blocks of love from this Most Glorious Youth, then raise it with hands of detachment, then adorn it with the gold of remembrance in commemoration of this Beauty through Whom the banner of majesty was raised in the heaven of independence, and thereby there befell him that which caused the eyes of those who were before and after to weep. O people! Enter the Most Holy Temple which God hath built with hands of grace in your hearts. Beware lest ye destroy it with the hosts of self and passion, then preserve it from the mention of satans. Say: By God! I am verily the Most Holy Temple in the Concourse on High, and the Much-frequented Fane in the realm of manifestation, and the Sanctuary of Grandeur at the Divine Lote-Tree, and where the Command was fulfilled at the Holy Place of permanence, and the station of holiness in this lofty and impregnable Paradise. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and destroy not His House of Command with hands of hatred, and demolish not its pillars through the promptings of self and passion. Fear God Who created you through the manifestation of His Self and sent unto you that whereby the eyes of eternity were consoled by His beauty, but ye are wrapped in the veils of your selves among the dead. O people! Break not God's covenant, nor cast His testament behind your backs, nor be among those who mock His signs, even as the servants mocked in those days - they whose realities were created by a stroke of His Pen - and thus were they among the transgressors.\n\nThen make mention in the Book of Mahdi that he may be guided by the guidance of God his Lord and be of those who are guided. O Mahdi! Take God's guidance with strength from Us and cast behind thy back the guidance of those who mention God with their tongues while opposing His Self and warring against His Being, yet perceive it not. When anyone enters their presence they sit cross-legged, then extend their fingertips from their sleeves and move their tongues with dignity in remembrance of thy Chosen Lord. This is what they do outwardly, while inwardly they pronounce against God to preserve their leadership, caring not the slightest bit about it. Say: By God, the Truth! Even if ye were to remember God to the point where your tongues were cut off, and worship Him until your backs were bent, it would profit you not except through My love. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the heaven of mighty glory. Would it profit those who were given the Furqan if they were to worship God with the worship of both worlds? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Likewise observe today among the people of the Bayan, if ye be of those who know. Thus hath the Finger of Power rent asunder the veil of concealment, and truth appeareth, and the Spirit speaketh with pure truthfulness between the heavens and the earths, that perchance people may know their Creator and not be veiled by what passeth between the servants from the remembrance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.\n\nThen the Pen of Command desired to make mention of the Messenger in the Tablet that his deed might correspond to his name and that he might be of those who act. O Messenger! Deliver the messages of thy Lord first unto thyself, then deliver them unto the people that thy word might influence the hearts of those who seek. Then send unto the servants what We have sent unto thee from the direction of the All-Merciful - the fragrances of glory - that perchance they may be drawn to the throne of good-pleasure, this hallowed, luminous station. Say: O people! Hearken unto the Word of God, then recite it in your days. God hath ordained for its reciter the good of this world and the next, and will raise him up in the gardens of Paradise in such beauty that all in the worlds will be illumined thereby. Well is it with him who reciteth the verses of his Lord and pondereth their mysteries and discovereth what hath been treasured therein of the gems of a preserving knowledge.\n\nThen remind the one who hath visited the Ancient House, that he may rejoice in that which hath been mentioned of God's traces in this firm, decisive and strong utterance. Say: By God! We have raised up the Sanctuary upon the Temple of Glorification in the Form of Honor, in the image of the Youth in these days. Blessed then be God, the Best of creators! And whoso circleth round it, verily the denizens of the Supreme Concourse circle round him, and then the temples of them that glorify. But God hath accepted from His loved ones that which they missed, as a grace from His presence, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Soon shall the hosts of God's sovereignty descend there, and they shall assuredly aid His Cause, exalt His remembrance, and recite His verses at dawn and eventide.\n\nO Herald of the Cause! Make mention from Us to those servants whose names the Pen of God hath not moved to inscribe, that the fragrant breezes of remembrance may waft upon them from the presence of One Forgiving, Merciful. Say: We have recorded your names on holy tablets which lay concealed behind the veils of the Cause and treasured in the strongholds of thy Lord's protection, the Ruler, the All-Wise. Let the loved ones of God gather together in His Cause in such wise that naught may arise between them to divide them, and that they may be as one soul. Thus have We commanded thee and them, that ye may be among the doers.\n\nThen make mention of the handmaidens of God who have believed in God their Creator, and those who have been afflicted with tribulations. Say: Be patient and grieve not at this, for God hath ordained for you and for those who have martyred in His path what no mind can comprehend. And the Spirit and glory and splendor be upon you, O hosts of God in all lands, if ye be of them that are steadfast in the Cause of your Lord.\n\n=== END BH00061 ===\n\n=== START BH00062 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nPraise be unto the Beloved of all possibility and the Goal of the peoples of the world, Who hath strengthened His loved ones to assist His Cause and exalt His Word, and enabled them to execute His commandments and ordinances which are the source of the world's order and the preservation of nations. They are the Hands of the Cause and the Letters of the Book. Through them power and dominion were made manifest and resplendent in the realm of earthly sovereignty. They are the stars in the heaven of Revelation and the standards of victory from God, the Lord of Resurrection. Through them the heaven hath rained, the sun hath shone forth, and the horizons have been illumined.\n\nThe letter of that noble soul was in truth a book that attracted the lovers of the Peerless Beauty, perfumed as it was with the mention of the Beloved of the world and illumined by the sun of His blessed Name. God knoweth that neither narcissus nor eglantine possesseth such fragrance, nor do ambergris and jasmine. Having inhaled its fragrance and learned of its contents, we turned toward the heaven of heavens and offered praise. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur, glorified be His majesty:\n\n\"O Lion! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Single, the One! Praise be to God that thou art occupied with the mention of the Truth and art steadfast in service to His Cause. Say: O servants! This Day is a different Day, requiring a different tongue to be worthy of praising the Beloved of the world, and different deeds to be acceptable at His threshold. The whole world longed for this Day, that perchance they might achieve that which is befitting and worthy. Blessed is the soul whom worldly affairs have not hindered from the Lord of all beings. The heedlessness of the people hath reached such a pass that they remain unaware of the sinking of cities, the leveling of mountains, and the cleaving of the earth. The signs and tokens of all the Books have become manifest, and at every moment the cry is raised, yet all are stupefied by the wine of heedlessness, save whom God willeth. Each day the earth is afflicted with a fresh calamity, ever increasing moment by moment. From the time of the revelation of the Suriy-i-Ra'is until this day, neither hath the earth found tranquility nor have the servants attained peace. At times contention, at times warfare, at times chronic diseases. The malady of the world hath reached such a state that it is nigh unto despair, for the true Physician is barred while the false healers are accepted and engaged. In these parts, in certain lands, signs of subsidence have appeared. Strange events have occurred and continue to occur, yet the heedless remain behind a manifest veil. Do they not reflect? Where is the Prime Minister of Iran, and his glory and wealth? Where is his power and might? The dust of discord hath seized the hearts and encompassed all eyes. Soon shall they witness what they have wrought in the days of God. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. God willing, mayest thou ever be assisted in the mention of the Truth, the praise of the Truth, and service to the Cause of Truth, in such wise that its traces may become manifest from the horizons of the world and the horizons of the hearts of all peoples. Give the friends of God, exalted be His glory, to drink of the wine of immortality in the Most Great Name, and gladden all with the mention of God and His favor. Say: Strive that ye may attain unto a word from the Kingdom of utterance.\" Thus it endeth.\n\nPraise be to God that the cup of reunion is at hand, arriving, as the Persians say, one after another. I beseech God that this cup may ever be in circulation, though it be mixed with the oppression of the Friend and renowned by the name of the Beloved. God willing, may this bounty never cease, nor may the hands of the aggressors alter it. May the servant drink thereof and hear \"Well done!\"\n\nThe two missives from your honor, dated the 9th and 24th of Dhi'l-Qa'dah, were like two brilliant suns illuminating this ephemeral heart. God willing, may such suns ever rise, dawn, shine and appear. This servant beseeches and hopes from God to be assisted in responding without delay, for from all directions there arrives that which renders one incapable of adequate reply. In all conditions, confirmation comes from God, exalted be His glory. He is verily the Confirmer, the Omnipotent.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about his honor the Sahib, upon him be the Glory of God, the response was previously submitted in two letters. God willing, they will have arrived by now, and may you be assisted in that which will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Praise be to God that your honor is in all conditions confirmed in wisdom. Concerning what you wrote about arriving in Qum and association with the friends of God, exalted be His glory, this detail was submitted. Thus spoke the Tongue of the Desired One, exalted be His glory: \"God willing, may they be ever engaged in serving the Cause and be assisted in guiding those who are heedless.\"\n\nRegarding what you wrote about his honor Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim and likewise the cotton-carders, upon them be the Glory of God, and their enthusiasm - God willing, may they ever remain occupied thus. Blessed are they and theirs is a goodly return.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about how beneficial it would be if someone were to occasionally visit those regions - this is a statement with which every informed scholar and wise mystic would agree. Ever has it been heard from the Blessed Tongue that certain souls, adorned with good character and mindful of the requirements of the time and wisdom, should journey to those parts and bestow the water of life. The breezes of the utterance of the All-Merciful should ever be wafting. This matter is, by command, necessary and obligatory. Blessed are they that act.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about his honor Na'ib 'Ali-Akbar Beg, upon him be the Glory of God - his honor Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, in two letters sent to this ephemeral one, mentioned him and wrote of his expressions of love, and likewise wrote in detail about a mount. In these matters, they have thus far shown the utmost consideration, and whatever has reached them from anyone has been conveyed to the Most Holy Court. This is what the servant testifies to according to his station and rank, and knowledge is with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nConcerning what was written in the other letter mentioning the beloved of God in Qum, upon them be the Glory of God, those very passages were submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur, exalted be His glory \\[...\\]\n\nO Lion! Upon thee be My glory! The intoxication of heedlessness hath encompassed the world. A guide is needed. The true friends of God are like the gentle breezes of spring - in whatsoever land they pass, they render the trees of being verdant and cause them to yield wondrous and exalted fruits. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation and command, for having aided thee to serve His Cause and having acquainted thee with that which was hidden from the eyes of all save whom God willeth. Convey my greetings to Ahmad, Ibrahim, and the carders, upon them be the Glory of God, and to the other friends in that land. God willing, may they attain such a station that the might and wrath of the oppressors shall not deter them from the Dayspring of Divine Unity. Say: O friends! This is the day of soaring, the day of mention and utterance. Ye must soar in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful on the wings of certitude in the name of the True One. The breezes of mercy are wafting, and the cup of the choice wine is being offered by the hands of bounty before all faces. Drink ye thereof in the name of your Lord, the Possessor of the Seen and the Unseen. Know ye the value of these days. Death is ordained for all; if it come in the path of God, it hath been and ever will be most beloved. The people of Baha must manifest themselves through goodly character and heavenly attributes, and must observe wisdom. In such case, whatsoever may befall them is, by the life of God, better than the life of the world. O friends! Let not the time slip away. With perfect dignity and composure, hold ye fast unto that which ye have been commanded in the Book. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAnd regarding what thou didst write about Aqa Muhammad-Ibrahim - upon him be the Glory of God - being aflame in that land, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of grace especially for him. God willing, may he attain unto it. His word, exalted be His majesty:\n\nHe is the Hearer, the Answerer \\[...\\]\n\nO Abraham! The Friend remembereth thee, who summoned all unto God, the Lord of all worlds. The Wronged One hath heard mention of thee and thy burning with the fire of the love of God, and remembereth thee in this luminous Tablet. We have entered into the Most Great Prison and have revealed that which God, the Mighty, the All-Wise, hath willed. Among the people are those who have cast away what they possessed and turned to the Supreme Horizon, believing in the One, the All-Informed, and drank the Kawthar of life from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Merciful. And among them are those who turned away and showed pride before God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld the evidences of its Lord, and the ear that hath heard His most great verses, and the tongue that hath spoken His beautiful remembrance. Take hold of the Book with the strength bestowed by Us in such wise that neither the veils of the divines prevent thee nor the conditions of the oppressors frighten thee. Say: O concourse of the earth! By God, the gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with mighty sovereignty, desiring to quicken the earth after its death. Fear God and be not of the heedless. By their tyranny the Concourse on High hath lamented and the eyes of them that are nigh have wept. Soon shall the world and all that the people possess perish, and there shall endure unto thee what hath been sent down in this noble station. We make mention of Our loved ones there who have held fast unto that which they were commanded in the Book by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Say: Should anyone come unto you with other than what God hath desired, leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O My loved ones! We make mention of you for the sake of God, that your names may thereby endure in His preserved Tablet. Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken while in the midst of the opposition. Rejoice in the days of your Lord! By God, the ocean of bounty hath surged and the horizon of Revelation hath been illumined by the sun of My holy, mighty and wondrous remembrance.\n\nGod willing, may they attain unto the visitation of this most mighty, most holy Tablet, be illumined by its light and enkindled by its heat, in such wise that its effects become manifest in the Concourse on High, let alone among the people of the earth. However, in all circumstances ye must observe wisdom, lest the croaking be raised and the divine wine remain concealed. Specifically for Aqa Siyyid Ahmad and the cotton-carders, upon them be the glory of God, exalted Tablets have previously been revealed. God willing, may they attain unto them and drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful.\n\nRegarding what was written about visiting the land of Jasb and meeting the loved ones of God, this evanescent servant wrote a letter in reply to the missive of Mulla Ghulam-Rida, and in that letter a most mighty, most holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of favor specifically for him, and likewise for each of the souls mentioned in his letter a blessed Tablet was revealed. Exalted, exalted is the bounty of our Beloved, and the loving-kindness of our Goal, and His mercy that hath preceded all who exist. For each of the friends whose name was mentioned in His presence, whether living or dead, there was revealed that which testifieth and proveth and beareth witness to His favor, loving-kindness and mercy. God willing, may the people of Baha recognize their stations and preserve them. How excellent is the deed of those who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken! A hundred thousand blessings upon the soul that hath arisen to teach the Cause of God and upon those souls who were blessed to hear and who arose with perfect steadfastness and firmness in the Cause. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist all in the world and to make known unto them what hath escaped them in these days the like of which the eyes have never seen.\n\nAnd as for your attention to the land of Badqan and mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and his being set ablaze with the fire of the love of God - mention of him was made in the letter of Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, and this servant submitted this matter. A most mighty and holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for him and the beloved ones of that land, and was sent to the aforementioned one to deliver. That beloved one should give them the glad-tidings of the blessed Tablet so they may engage in serving the Cause with divine confirmations more than before. And specifically for Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim from Qum, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, a most mighty and holy Tablet was also revealed and sent to Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan to deliver, as they had made mention of the aforementioned one, and since that beloved one has also made mention, another most mighty and honored Tablet was once again revealed and details thereof were submitted. God willing that beloved one will deliver them. The aforementioned one has become the recipient of two Tablets. God willing these two Tablets will become two wings for his soaring in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful.\n\nAnd as for what you wrote regarding Naraq and the beloved ones of that land, it was submitted before His presence and mention of each of those souls issued from the blessed tongue, and He said: \"Praise be to God that Jinab-i-Asad, upon him be My glory, has succeeded in serving the Truth and in His mention and praise - a matter which today is most important and is considered by God as the mightiest pillar of teaching, and he is engaged in it with utmost joy and fragrance. Blessed is he and blessed is he who heareth from him what God hath revealed in the Book. The beloved ones of the land of N and R have been under the glances of favor. God willing they will be assisted to achieve that which beseemeth the Day of God and be confirmed in that which is the cause and means of the perpetuation of mention. The river floweth and the ocean is manifest. Blessed are they that attain.\" This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings and praise to them. It is hoped from God's profound grace, exalted be His glory, that He will confirm all to unity and harmony and to that which today is the cause of the exaltation of God's Cause.\n\nAnd as for what you wrote that at the time of writing, Jinab-i-Aqa Mir from Fath-Abad, upon him be Baha'u'llah's glory, also requested that mention be made of him - this matter was submitted. This is what the tongue of the Beloved uttered in reply, exalted be His grandeur: \"O Mir! God willing may the lights of the Day of Manifestation illumine you at all times and keep you occupied with the mention of the Peerless Friend. Observe the people - a world wherein all acknowledge and confess their mortality, yet they have taken it as their object of worship and have remained deprived and forbidden from the true Object of Worship and the lights of the spiritual Sun. O Mir! Hearken unto the call of this Prisoner. Verily He will assist thee and draw thee nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Mention of steadfast souls hath flowed and been revealed from the Supreme Pen. God willing may they hold fast unto what God hath willed and be detached and free from aught else. I convey greetings to all the friends of that land and other regions, and counsel them to that which is the cause of the loftiness and elevation of man's station. Blessed are they that act and woe unto the heedless. The glory shining forth from the horizon of thy Lord the All-Merciful's will be upon thee and upon them and upon every patient and grateful one. Praise be to God, the Kind, the Forgiving.\"\n\nO Muhammad-Rida! Praise be to the Beloved of the world Who hath aided thee through the grace of His Most Great Name and guided thee unto that whereof most of the peoples of the earth remain heedless and veiled. The path of God is clear, His verses are revealed, and His evidences are manifest; yet all are heedless save whom God willeth. Know thou the value of these days and occupy thyself with the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory. The might of the tyrants, the dominion of the Pharaohs, the power of the Chosroes, and the wealth of the Caesars - all were witnessed to be fleeting and non-existent, and that which is visible today will likewise return to nothingness. It behooveth man to cling unto that which is everlasting and enduring. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having caused thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Dayspring of His signs, and the Manifestation of His Self, and for having sent down unto thee that which all the kingdoms of the earth cannot equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Then beseech Him to aid thee in that which is meet for His days. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the Answering. Praise be to God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.\n\nWe earnestly hope that at all times thou wilt derive from the divine utterances that which conduceth to life and permanence. Verily, this servant loveth to make mention of him who hath turned unto God, attained unto His recognition, submitted to His sovereignty, and voiced His praise. As to what thou didst write about visiting on behalf of that loved one: for two hours on Tuesday night, the 25th of Rabi'u'l-Avval, I sought the presence of the Lord of all beings, and after attaining His presence and receiving permission, the visitation and circumambulation were performed and, praise be to God, were graced with acceptance. May it be well with thee!\n\nRegarding thy mention of the Land of Kaf and the Navvab - upon him be the glory of God - and Haji Siyyid Muhammad and Aqa Siyyid Nasru'llah and Aqa Siyyid Hashim - upon them be the glory of God - these have attained unto the hearing of the Lord of Names, and the sun of grace hath shone and beamed forth upon each one. Some time ago this servant wrote and sent a detailed letter to the Navvab, and likewise a most holy and exalted Tablet was sent specifically for him, and similarly, exalted and glorious Tablets were sent specifically for Haji Siyyid Muhammad and the other friends through Sheikh S - upon him be the glory of God. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid them all in such wise that the transient things of this fleeting world may not withhold them from the Lord of Names, that they may be enabled to achieve that which is befitting and be confirmed in that which is adorned with the ornament of immortality. Similarly, that other letter from that loved one, dated the 27th of Dhi'l-Hijjih, was in truth a healing remedy for this ailing servant, for it was adorned and perfumed with the fragrance of that loved one's sincerity, for the sake of God, the Single, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nRegarding the mention of returning to the land of Qamsar and also meeting with Haji Siyyid Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God - mention of him was made in the Most Holy Presence and a special Tablet was revealed for him from the heaven of bounty. Likewise for my letter to Aqa Mir Abdul-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God, and specifically for them in my letter a Most Holy Tablet was revealed. Similarly, for each of the individuals mentioned in their letter, wondrous, exalted and impregnable Tablets have dawned from the horizon of the heaven of grace. God willing, they will attain unto them. And likewise specifically for Mulla Ghulam-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, from the land of Jasb, and the souls mentioned in his letter which he had written to this servant, and also specifically for Sheikh Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, and the souls mentioned in his letter. Praise be to God, regarding all the names mentioned in the packets of that beloved one, the manifestation of bounty and supreme favor from the Dawning-Place of the mercy of the Lord of Names is evident and clear. That beloved one should observe them and after making copies should send the originals to Haji Siyyid Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God, and he after reviewing should deliver them to their owners, namely the souls mentioned.\n\nAnd regarding what was written about the Huquq, the sale of properties is not permitted according to the Command. Those souls upon whom Huquq has become incumbent should, if they are able, be blessed to pay it. They said: We have left the properties to those souls themselves - they may dispose of them as they wish. The benefit of good deeds returns to the souls performing them, especially for one who is enabled to pay the Right of God. This is a matter that must be carried out with utmost honor. Whosoever turns towards it and pays it with complete willingness and contentment, the Trustees should accept it from him, otherwise He verily is independent of all worlds.\n\nThis supreme word has issued from the Most Exalted Pen specifically for Abu'l-Hasan Ardikani: Forsake the entire world but forsake not an atom's weight of the honor of God's Cause. Blessed are those souls who have truly arisen today to render service and have been enabled to do what is befitting.\n\nWith regard to what was written concerning teachers of the Cause, this found acceptance in the Most Holy Court. In truth, every soul who arises to serve this most great and momentous Cause must be adorned with all virtues, both outward and inward, and must have sufficient means. In whatever land he enters, the fragrance of detachment must waft from him. Indeed, that beloved one has expressed a most pleasing statement on this matter. God willing, that beloved one shall be assisted and confirmed in all conditions to undertake whatsoever will exalt God's Cause. They stated that the provisions for teachers are of two kinds, both of which are necessary: First, reliance upon God, and second, they should be given a portion of what is collected from the Huququ'llah. This matter has been concluded. In previous years, sufficient guidance regarding the qualifications of teachers has been revealed from the Supreme Pen. Truly this is a most mighty matter. Blessed is he who attains unto it, for he is among those who have aided God, his Lord, to the utmost possible degree. God willing, the wealthy souls shall be enabled to pay the Rights of God so that these matters may be carried out in the utmost spirit and joy throughout the earth. Had they known, they would have spent their very souls and all they possess in the path of God. Furthermore, that beloved one is himself authorized to receive the Rights of God. Praise be to God, that honorable one has received the effulgences of the Sun of Providence. His is the praise in all conditions, and He is the Kind, the Generous.\n\nThat beloved one's arrangement regarding the Rights of God was indeed sound and firm. However, since this matter depends on the actions of many souls in cities and villages, it will inevitably become widely known, and its spread will cause commotion among the heedless and ignorant. Therefore, one must act according to what God has commanded. Regarding the two units of Rights that were mentioned, by command they should be used by Haji Siyyid Ibrahim himself according to the number of the Greatest Name, to be spent during the festivals or given to the poor - both are acceptable in the sight of God. The remainder goes to that beloved one or to Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be 95 \\[Baha'u'llah\\].\n\nAs for the mention of Aqa Muhammad Hashim and three others who attained to the wine of faith, this was presented before His presence. This is what was revealed in response from the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the Final End. Exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious\n\nO Hashim! He who has arisen to serve Me and dedicated his affairs to the triumph of My Cause has mentioned thee. We make mention of thee as a token of Our grace, for We are truly the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Blessed is the house wherein My remembrance is raised, and blessed is the servant who has been adorned with the ornament of My love, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Give thanks to God for having enabled thee to recognize Him and guided thee to His straight path. It behooveth thee to thank God at all times. Verily thy Lord is the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nWe make mention of Muhammad, who has turned toward the Supreme Horizon and attained to this Cause, from which all on earth have turned aside save whom God has willed, the Lord of all worlds. O Muhammad! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of the Prison and say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having made me know Thee and given me to drink from the Kawthar of utterance from the hands of bounty. I testify that Thy grace has preceded the world. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nWe make mention of the handmaiden of God who has turned unto Him and desired to drink from the Kawthar of utterance in the days of her Lord, the Most Merciful. Blessed is every handmaiden who has attained unto this noble station. We make mention of another handmaiden and give her glad tidings of My grace and bounty, and We command her and My handmaidens to be steadfast in the Cause and to act in accordance with that which befitteth the days of God, the Single, the One, the All-Informed.\n\nThe petition of Aqa Muhammad Hashim was presented before His presence. The Tongue of Favor spoke these blessed words: \"We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for her that which shall profit her in the hereafter and in this world. Verily He knoweth what is with Him, and He is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nAnd regarding what was written that Aqa Muhammad Hashim desired his household in (city of) ? to attain unto the Name \\[of God\\] and become a place of passage for the loved ones of God, this was presented. Thus spoke the Tongue of our Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and earth, exalted be His glory: \"O Lion! Upon thee be My glory! We have accepted what thou hast written. Give glad tidings from Me to him who is named Muhammad-i-Hashim, that he may thank God, his Lord, for this great bounty.\"\n\nBlessed are they who have recognized the station of this divine Day and have attained unto the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord. All the Prophets and Messengers beseeched God, exalted be His glory, for the attainment of this Day, and this matter is recorded and inscribed in all divine Books and Scriptures. Nevertheless, none attained save the people of the Crimson Ark, mention of which was revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Qayyumu'l-Asma'. God willing, through the confirmations of the Desired One, those souls who have not been contaminated by rancor and hatred will perceive the fragrances of revelation and attain unto that which is intended. Convey My greetings to My loved ones in the cities and regions, and give them glad tidings of God's grace, His bounty and His mercy that have encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven.\n\nO beloved of My heart! Those souls from whom emanate and diffuse the fragrances of the love of the Beloved of the worlds truly have no equal or likeness, and never will. This evanescent servant has always cherished and continues to cherish their mention, to such an extent that were all days and nights to be spent in their remembrance, it would still appear less than an atom. This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to ordain for them stations that have no equal. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nAnd regarding the mention \\[you made\\] of Muhammad Husayn, son of the honored Aqa Muhammad Baqir, upon them both be the glory of God, this matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. His word, exalted and mighty is He: He is the Witness, the Speaker, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! This is the day of acceptance, of turning to God, of mention and praise and service. God willing, may you be fresh and verdant through the spring breezes of the Divine Springtime and be vocal in praising the Best Beloved of the worlds. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of Revelation that one mention today is more glorious in the sight of God than the mention of a multitude occurring in other days. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord's bounty and place thy trust in Him. Verily He aideth whomsoever He willeth through a command from His presence, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect thee and the people of that land from the croaking of the croakers and the clamor of the false ones and the deceivers. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We, from this spot, send Our greetings upon thee and upon My loved ones who responded when they heard My mighty, wondrous call.\n\nPraise be to God that whosoever was mentioned by the pen of that Best Beloved attained the grace of God, exalted be His glory. God willing, may you recognize the value of this most glorious, most exalted station and preserve it in the name of the Best Beloved of creation. Most matters today are hidden. Would that I could find the fragrance of permission and mention to the friends of God what hath been ordained for them by God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nConcerning what was written about Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be Baha'u'llah, that through consultation it was decided that he should remain in the land of K and travel periodically to its surroundings to remind people of the Divine Cause - this matter was accepted before the Divine Presence. God willing, may he succeed in this most great service and act according to what God desires. In all circumstances, he must observe wisdom. Although praise be to God his services are clear as the sun and have no need of mention by this servant, this statement is made in view of the emphasis of the Ancient Beauty. One day this exalted word was revealed from the blessed tongue: It is contrary to wisdom for those who migrate for God's sake, specifically traveling to cities and regions to teach the Cause, to stay openly in the home of a well-known believer. From this utterance of the Best Beloved of creation, the importance of wisdom becomes evident and clear. They also said that such persons should be allocated from the Huququ'llah according to their needs. And that he has now turned toward Mazandaran - this too is acceptable in the sight of God. God willing, may souls be specially raised up for this great service and turn toward cities and regions with perfect detachment, piety and fear of God, that perchance the decayed bones might be quickened by the outpourings of the ocean of Divine utterance, until all may be adorned with the words \"Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him shall we return.\"\n\nThe fourth letter of His Holiness, which was written on the 6th of Muharram 1299, brought both sorrow and joy - praise be to God in all conditions. After its reading and review, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Station and presented it all in the Supreme Presence before His countenance. His words, exalted be His majesty: \"O Lion! Upon thee be My Glory! The scratching of the Supreme Pen hath not ceased during the nights and days. God willing, may the people of the world attain unto the privilege of hearkening unto it. Today the Sun of Truth is observed at its zenith in all conditions. Eyes capable of beholding it are exceedingly rare. God willing, may your honor, through the collyrium of wisdom, remove the soreness from eyes, that they may not remain deprived in these days, which are the king of days. We repeatedly say: Convey greetings to the friends of God in every land thou meetest, on behalf of the Wronged One, that they may attain unto the divine fragrances of glorification and engage in that which exalteth the Cause.\"\n\nRepeatedly in this letter of His Holiness, mention was made of the Huquq. Regarding this matter, whatsoever was heard from the blessed tongue was presented. May He assist all to discharge it whenever capacity and strength become manifest. Blessed are they that act, and blessed are they that attain!\n\nAs for what thou didst write concerning thy brother, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], and the degrees of his acceptance, sincerity, humility and submissiveness - this became the cause of renewed joy. In the divine Tablets, that which hath been revealed concerning him is that whose fruit hath appeared and shall continue to appear. And that which that beloved one wrote in this regard, this evanescent servant presented in detail one night in His presence. He smiled, and then uttered these blessed words - exalted be His grandeur: \"God willing, may he be confirmed by divine confirmations. We have revealed for him that which nothing can equal. We, from this station, glorify him and give him glad tidings of what God, the Lord of the worlds, hath desired for him. Verily all affairs are in the grip of His power. He doeth what He willeth by His sovereignty. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful.\"\n\nPraise be to God! The signs of grace, favor and mercy are manifest and evident concerning that honored one and his kindred. We beseech Him to confirm them in that which is lasting and enduring, and to ordain for them the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Wise. This evanescent one conveyeth greetings unto them. God willing, may they attain unto outward and inward good. They have not departed from this evanescent one's sight, nor shall they ever.\n\nAnd concerning what was written in another letter about serving some and declining honors for the sake of God's Cause - this was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. These supreme words were uttered from the Dayspring of the Cause - exalted be He: \"Blessed is he and blessed is he who heareth his words. What they have written is correct and complete.\"\n\nAs regards Mulla Ghulam-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, from the people of Faran and the story of the horse which you wrote about - He said that his deed was for God's sake and surely its non-acceptance would have caused sadness. We make mention of him at this time, in this hour, on this night, in this prison, and in this station which tongues are powerless to describe and pens fail to praise. We give him glad tidings of the acceptance of what he did in My path, and We remember him as We remembered him before - and verily I am the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. May God willing, that beloved one attains to whatsoever is beloved at the Divine Threshold and acts in accordance with that which brings glory to the Cause.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about intending to visit the lands of A, R, ?, N and surroundings - all these matters were presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: God willing, may they pass like the morning breeze over the divine regions and remind all, that perchance the trees in the spiritual garden may become adorned with wondrous and exalted fruits, namely, goodly and pleasing deeds.\n\nThis evanescent one submits that the people of Kha, namely Aqa Khudadad and Aqa 'Azizu'llah, upon them be the Glory of God, and other friends of God have made mention of you, just as you yourself have taken precedence in this regard and wrote in detail previously about mentioning the friends in the land of Kha. In these days some have requested that you journey to that direction, especially Aqa 'Azizu'llah. God willing, through divine confirmations, may you visit all the aforementioned lands and remind everyone.\n\nThis evanescent one's other submission to the beloved Mulla 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power - my expression of sincerity, self-effacement and nothingness depends on that beloved one's favor. His letter, praise be to God, was the cause of joy and delight. Likewise, the letter he had written to Aqa Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented at the Most Holy Court. The utmost favor was shown and in truth it became the cause of remembrance for some. The word of truth is ever effective. Similarly, they had also sent a letter to the Name of Bounty (Ism-i-Jud), upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - that too was presented at the Most Holy Court. This servant delayed sending a response this time, being assured that you were in the land of ?a. God willing, it is hoped that this evanescent one will be enabled to submit a response next time.\n\nThe petition of Aqa Mirza ?adiq, son of Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon them both be the Glory of God, attained the Most Holy Court and was presented before the Throne. This is what was sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance of our Lord, the Most Merciful. His exalted Word:\n\nHe is the One Who speaks from His Most Glorious Horizon \\[...\\]\n\nO Sadiq! Your letter has arrived and We have heard your call and perceived the fragrance of your love. Blessed be your father and mother, and blessed is he whom God has granted righteous offspring who utters praise of the Beloved and arises to serve His wise and irrevocable Cause. Rejoice that We have answered you with that which will draw you closer to God, the Lord of all worlds. We previously mentioned your father and his sister in verses that nothing can equal. Verily your Lord is the All-Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We sent it with Salman who traveled through the lands with the tablets of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon you and upon him who wrote your letter (Kamal'd-Din) and upon whosoever has turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, the Station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaims: \"The Kingdom belongs to God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day.\"\n\nWe make mention of him who was named Nasru'llah, who remembered Me, and I am the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Say: Beware lest the affairs of the world prevent you from the Ancient Lord. Abandon them and take what you have been commanded by the Mighty, the Wise. We have heard your call, answered you and turned toward you from this distant station. Glory be upon you and upon those whose names you mentioned in the letter of him who was named Sadiq, who turned his face toward his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Rejoice, O My loved ones! He has come with the ocean of grace and forgiven those who sought forgiveness. He is verily the Forgiver, the Bountiful, the Kind, the Generous.\n\nGod willing, may the souls mentioned attain unto these wondrous verses. Praise be to God that their mention was raised to the station whereto nothing can be compared, and for each one the Sun of the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, has dawned.\n\nThis evanescent one further submits that the beloved of the heart, the son of His Name \"The Most Truthful,\" upon them both be the glory and favor of God, sent two letters to this servant. The response to the first letter was submitted, and it was intended to be sent this time. Then the second letter arrived. This evanescent servant wished to submit its response as well and send them together. The second letter arrived when the post was about to depart and there was no time. The expression of evanescence and nothingness in service to \\[them\\] depends on the mercy of that Beloved. God willing, may they be as lightning, moving and luminous in service to the Beloved of the worlds, and like arteries pulsating in the body of the world. The command belongs to God, the Mighty, the Most Generous.\n\nAnother letter arrived and brought sadness, for God is witness that when I am occupied with mention of the gentlemen, meaning those souls who are steadfast in the Cause of God, the warmth of love takes hold of my being. It is submitted with utmost eagerness, ardor and fondness, and near the end, grief takes hold. This servant beseeches God for joy, relief and delight for your honor and for those who have attained to serving the Cause in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. The request is that in every land you enter, convey this evanescent one's greetings and praise to the friends of God. God willing, may all be assisted to achieve perfect unity and harmony, which is truly the greatest elixir for the copper-like bodies of the world. Glory be upon your honor and upon the loved ones and friends of God in all regions. He is verily the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\n\\[4 Rabi'u'th-Thani\\] 1299\n\n=== END BH00062 ===\n\n=== START BH00063 ===\n\nO thou who art My Name! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy! The Most Exalted Pen hath testified to thy steadfastness in My service and thy diligence in promoting My Cause and My Word. Thou didst choose exile out of love for the peoples of the world and didst traverse lands to guide the nations. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the utterance and hath turned towards it with spirit and delight. Woe unto every heedless one who hath held back, and every slumberer who hath been debarred, and every wanderer whose efforts in this vain life have gone astray. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from His praiseworthy station.\n\nO thou who art My Name! Behold and then call to mind when thou didst stand before the Wronged One and the Speaker of Sinai Who hath come with the signs of the Manifestation conversed with thee in such wise as to reveal that which had been inscribed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God! The meanings did prostrate themselves when the utterance was revealed from the tongue of your Lord, the All-Merciful. He Who speaketh and will continue to speak in every condition doth testify to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nBy thy life, O Thou Who art the Beloved of my being and art mentioned in my heart! Were the essence of thanksgiving to appear with a hundred thousand tongues, and were the temple of praise from time immemorial unto time immemorial to voice forth praise and glorification of the Truth - exalted be His glory - it would fail to requite a single one of His bestowals. One of His bestowals - exalted and glorified be He - is that He hath adorned the hearts of His friends and chosen ones with the ornament of love. Should one endowed with insight contemplate its outward aspect and reflect thereon, he would find himself in a boundless ocean of wonderment, and should he ponder its inward reality, he would be moved to proclaim that its station is beyond description. Exalted be His favors that have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, and magnified be His mercy through which existence hath appeared and the Tree hath spoken forth on Sinai. According to a well-known tradition, He hath declared love to be the cause and reason for creation. Man standeth bewildered before this Most Great Ocean and its waves. Praised be God that the ocean of inner meanings hath become manifest and visible, and its waves are that which proceedeth from the Mouth of the Divine Will - namely the Most Exalted Word and the Letters that have appeared in the Kingdom of Creation. These exalted letters are accounted as waves of the ocean and as hosts of God, for by these hosts hath He taken possession of the world and made it subservient. Exalted be His power and glorified be His dominion. There is no God but Him \\[...\\]\n\nO Mahdi! We have made mention of thee in such wise that nothing can equal it, and We make mention of thee through that which will regenerate the world through the bounty of the Lord of eternity. Be thou thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Sovereign of the seen and the unseen! Convey unto the people that which We have commanded thee and remind them of that which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Take thou a cup from the Kawthar of utterance and sprinkle thereof upon the dead, in the name of Him Who revealeth the verses, Who hath turned towards thee from this forbidden spot. Say: Fear ye God, O peoples of the earth, and follow not the desires of such as have denied the proof and turned away from the All-Merciful when He came with sovereignty that transcended all who are adorned with the ornament of being. Say: If ye would judge fairly concerning that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful's will, then speak ye with pure truthfulness. This will deliver you and guide you to His extended path. Cast away what ye possess and take what hath been given you from God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest the doubts of the divines hold you back from Him Who is the Lord of all names. Rend asunder with the finger of certitude the veils of idle fancy, clinging to the hem of the robe of your Lord's loving-kindness, the All-Forgiving, the All-Affectionate. O peoples of the earth! Purify your ears from that which ye have heard from the ignorant ones and your hearts from the insinuations of such as have disbelieved in God in this Revelation. We have sent down the verses and manifested the proofs in such wise that none will deny them save every stubborn opponent. This is the news whereof God's Books have given glad tidings aforetime, and after them the Prophets and Messengers have borne witness. O heedless ones! Open your eyes: verily the Sun hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of grace and the Ocean of Life hath surged within all possibilities. Come ye, come ye, and follow not every ignorant outcast. The lips of being have smiled at this Revelation, as attesteth every fair-minded one who hath attained pure truthfulness in the days of God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.\n\nO My Name! The servant present has come with thy letter and presented that which thy tongue, both outward and inward, hath uttered in praise of God, Lord of all worlds. From every word We perceived the fragrance of thy submissiveness, humility and supplication before God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. We have adorned thy head with the crown of My remembrance and thy temple with the robe of My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nO My Name! Remind My loved ones and My friends in My behalf with a remembrance that will generate love and unity in such wise that they will renounce all they possess, clinging to that which hath come to them from the True One, the Knower of things unseen.\n\nO My Name! Convey to all the greetings from the True One and strive that the fire of true love may be kindled amongst them. Say: Let not the fruits of the tree of unity slip from your grasp. Were ye to become aware, ye would seek it with your very souls. The steadfast souls of earlier times must show forth the utmost love and kindness to others, and others must hearken unto them and arise for the love of God, that the diverse peoples of the world may inhale the fragrance of unity. By My life, O My Name! This hath been and is the foundation of the Cause and the source of divine wisdom. They must arise with such love as to cause faces to turn and hearts to be attracted. All matters are witnessed before God. How many souls there are who outwardly show acceptance yet manifest neither fruit nor trace, nevertheless they become the recipients of favor. The breezes of grace guided some of these souls and enabled them to attain their heart's desire. The mercy of God, exalted be His glory, hath taken precedence; the grace of His near ones must likewise take precedence. Blessed are they who have shown humility for God's sake. We testify that whoso showeth humility toward My loved ones hath shown humility before My own Self and hath visited My glorious Kingdom. In this matter, which is the most ancient and greatest of all matters, exert vigorous efforts that perchance all horizons may be illumined with the light of unity. Verily He is thy Helper and thy Supporter, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. That which ye have carried out in this journey hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and love thee and hearken unto thy word, from God, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nO beloved of my heart! When the ocean of grace surgeth, what can a mere drop accomplish? Whatever may be offered is meaningless and whatever may be said is unworthy. I beseech the Exalted True One, glorified be His grandeur, to make that beloved one the dawning-place of enduring traces. Verily He hath power over all things.\n\nAs to the mention made of Muhammad Rasul, upon him be the Glory of God (966), and likewise the arrangement made with the beloved Andalib, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, all were presented at the Most Holy Court, together with their letter written to that presence. The Sun of grace shone forth and was evident in relation to them. May they ever be the recipients of grace and steadfast in service. O My Name! The honored Andalib, upon him be My glory, is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. I testify that he hath turned unto God and attained the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds, and hath arisen to serve Him amongst His servants. And I am the All-Seeing Witness.\n\nAs to what was arranged concerning the Huquq, it hath been accepted and is well-pleasing before the Throne. We testify that thy deed was purely for My sake and in quest of My good-pleasure. Upon thee be My glory. We have instructed the servant present to transcribe and send it forth. We likewise make mention of the Siyyids. They are servants who have believed in God and turned toward Him. We have mentioned them in various Tablets as a token of Our grace. Glorified be He Who hath aided them and enabled them to do that which He loveth and approveth. By My life! The whole world hath not and cannot equal these words. We likewise make mention of Muhammad the Messenger and give him the glad-tidings of divine favors. God willing, may all abide protected and joyous beneath the shade of the Tree of Providence.\n\nO My Name! We make mention in this place of him who hath been named Qasim and give him the glad-tidings of My acceptance, My attention toward him, and My approval of what he hath wrought in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O My Name! Remind him of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will as a mercy from Me, for I am the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Kind.\n\nWe make mention of My loved ones in Ra and Shin and their surroundings, that they may be assured by the grace of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of the Nightingale once again that he may rejoice and be among the thankful. We have mentioned him in such wise as hath made the lips of understanding smile. Exalted be the All-Merciful Who hath guided him to His straight path and caused him to speak His praise and glorification among the servants. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O My loved ones in that place! Know ye his station, then thank Him Who hath sent down unto you that whereby your mention shall endure throughout the duration of My most excellent names. We counsel you with that whereby the Cause of God, the True King, the Manifest, shall be exalted. Take hold of the Book of God with the power granted by Us and fear not the hosts of the oppressors. Woe unto the world that hath denied the right of God and His Cause, and turned away from Him Who created it by a word from Him. He is assuredly among the most lost. Blessed are ye for having cast him and his like behind your backs, turning unto the Most Sublime Horizon on a Day proclaimed in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Hold fast unto the cord of unity and cleave unto that whereby the Cause of God, your Beloved and the Beloved of them that know, may be exalted. He verily seeth you and heareth what your tongues utter. Your Lord, the All-Merciful, is in truth the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing. Grieve not at what the idolaters say. Behold and then recall what they uttered when Muhammad the Messenger of God appeared, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him the Interlocutor. Shame upon a world that hath gone astray and led the servants astray. We testify that by its tyranny the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise have lamented, as have the inhabitants of the pavilions of Glory and Grandeur, and the people of the tabernacle of \\[Infallibility\\] in a noble station. The Glory be upon you and upon your children and your families from the presence of One Mighty, Beauteous. God hath forgiven you and your fathers and your mothers as a favor from Him. Be grateful therefore and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that are nigh!\"\n\nThe End. Glory be to God! One deed was performed, and as it was for God's sake, its fragrance encompassed the world. For at this moment, which is eight o'clock on Monday the twenty-second of Muharram, the Ancient Beauty hath, with utmost grace, mentioned all collectively and then individually, and adorned all with the robe of forgiveness. Exalted, exalted be this most great favor, and exalted be this mighty generosity! O beloved of my heart! In truth the favor is of such magnitude that all tongues are powerless and fall short of its mention. To this testifieth every atom, every thing, every sign, and every fair-minded and perceiving one.\n\nIn the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence was mentioned Aqa Mirza Muhammad Darbaghi, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, and this is what was revealed in response from the Lord of the Final End - exalted be His greatness:\n\nIn His Name, the Hearer, the Answerer\n\nO Muhammad! Ismi Mahdi in his letter sent to this Servant mentioned thee, and likewise made mention of the friends in that land. God willing, mayest thou ever be blessed with divine favors and remain turned toward the highest horizon, for should man show the slightest negligence, the smoke of the imaginings of the veiled ones will deprive him. Praise be to God that thou didst hear the divine call and didst turn toward His horizon. Preserve this mighty station through the power of the Most Great Name. Mention of smoke hath been revealed in one of the Tablets. God willing, may all be preserved from it. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the way, and He is the Speaker, the Helper, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nThis is the Day which all the Messengers and Books have heralded. Nevertheless, most of the divines of the earth remain veiled and heedless thereof, and have become the cause of the heedlessness of the servants. They are the greatest veil and the thick coverings. Blessed is the soul whom the veils of these heedless ones have not prevented from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. O Muhammad! Give thanks to the Goal of all the worlds Who assisted thee in a Cause from which most of them that are on earth are veiled. God willing, mayest thou be aided to achieve the most great steadfastness and that from which the fragrance of eternity can be inhaled. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee.\n\nAnd regarding the mention made of Mirza ?ahmasb-Quli Beg, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and these decisive verses were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Creator of existence, specifically for him - exalted and mighty be His utterance:\n\nArdabil\n\nJenab-i-?ahmasb-Quli Beg, upon him be the Glory of God\n\nIn His Name, the One Who ruleth over all names \\[...\\]\n\nThe servant present read thy letter before the Wronged One and was favored with His hearing. From its words and phrases wafted the fragrance of love. God willing, thou shalt ever drink from the cup of the eternal Beloved's grace and remain focused on the horizon of His Cause. O thou who art enkindled with the fire of separation and hast turned to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment! Grieve not over anything. Trust in all matters in thy Lord. Verily He is the Companion of the companionless, the Helper of the helpless, the Supporter of whosoever arises to mention and praise Him, the Confirmer of whosoever turns to Him, and the Answerer of whosoever calls upon Him. Blessed is the face that hath turned unto His Face, and the ear that hath been honored by His sweetest call as it was raised between earth and heaven.\n\nWe counsel thee to be steadfast in the Cause, to manifest spiritual qualities and praiseworthy deeds, and to speak goodly words. By My life, whoso acteth in accordance with what hath been ordained by God is assuredly among those who are nigh unto Him in a perspicuous Book. Praise be to God that on this blessed day thou hast inhaled the fragrance of His garment and turned toward His straight path. This is a great bounty and a mighty blessing. By the life of God, the precious jewels of earth and the treasures of kings cannot compare with it. Know thou its station, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Generous One.\n\nThe Truth, exalted be His glory, hath been and will ever be with His loved ones. Verily He is the Near One, the Watchful. O Tahmasb! Give thanks to the Lord of eternity Who hath blessed thee and engaged Himself with thy mention in this Most Great Prison. That which this Wronged One hath ever desired is the salvation of all. God willing, mayest thou speak the praise of the Beloved of all worlds with the utmost joy and delight, and hold fast unto the will of God. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the Lord of eternity was in the Most Great Prison, that thou mayest be among the steadfast ones.\n\nIn these days this region is somewhat disturbed; therefore it is not permissible to turn towards this direction. The Wronged One beseecheth God to ordain for thee the reward of attaining His presence and to decree for thee the good of this world and the world to come. Verily He is powerful over all things. The splendor shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have clung to the hem of their Lord's mercy, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nGod willing, may they be illumined by the effulgent lights of the Sun of utterance and meaning that hath shone forth from the Supreme Pen's horizon, and drink from the chalices of success wherein it lieth concealed. Verily He is the Bestower, the Munificent, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nRegarding what was written about the honored Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, that he intendeth to travel to various regions - God willing, may this intention pass from potentiality to actuality. He hath had this intention for some time, but it hath not yet emerged from the realm of the unseen into the world of manifestation. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to quicken the dead with the water of His utterance, and every decomposed bone. It is hoped that the winds of will shall move him. Some time ago a detailed, extensive letter was submitted and sent to his presence. God willing, it hath arrived by now. He wrote a letter to this servant in these days, but since no word of the previous one had arrived, there was a delay in sending a second reply. God willing, may he ever dwell with the utmost joy and delight beneath the shade of the Beloved of the worlds' loving-kindness.\n\nRegarding what thou didst write about Murad Khan, it was presented before the presence of the Ancient Beauty, and this most holy, most exalted Tablet was revealed especially for him. His exalted Word:\n\nQ. His honor Allah-Murad Khan\n\nIn His Name, the Hearer, the Answerer \\[...\\]\n\nVerily We have heard thy call and thy turning unto Us, and We have remembered thee with that which its fragrance will never pass away, through the everlastingness of God's Most Beautiful Names. Be thou thankful for this and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds! I testify that Thou hast called all unto God and hast borne in His path that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace to strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO Murad! Rejoice in that the Desire of the world hath remembered thee. Nothing that thou witnesseth and beholdeth can equal this, as testified by His Clear Book. Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and turned unto the All-Informed One. How many a learned one hath been hindered, how many a knower hath denied, and how many a servant hath turned and rent the veil through My Most Great Name. Glory be upon thee and upon every steadfast and faithful one who hath turned unto Him.\n\nAs commanded, if he is aflame with the fire of love, let it be bestowed. They said: O My Name! Whosoever is mentioned in the Most Holy Court hath attained unto divine favor. This is My practice which hath been established from the beginning of My Revelation, as attested by those in My presence who record that which descendeth from the heaven of My grandeur, and beyond them, verily Thou art the Witness, the All-Seeing. For these are days of grace, therefore it hath been and continues to be bestowed. Otherwise, in truth, were the stations and ranks of the servants to be observed, little worthiness would be found. But God, thy Lord, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about gatherings and meetings of the friends, and likewise their feasts in the path of God, these details were presented before the Countenance. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His utterance: Blessed are they who have found companionship with My Name and have honored His dwelling place. God willing, may that gathering not be scattered by various corrupting winds, and may the dawning-places of vain imaginings not prevent them from the lights of certitude. May their unity increase at all times until all are illumined together by the lights of the Divine Word and become the cause and means of enlightening the world. We mention them all and give them glad tidings of what hath been ordained for them. Verily, We from this station send Our glorification upon them and give them the glad tidings of God's grace, bounty and mercy. For whatsoever they have done hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. How excellent is this most exalted station! God willing, may they remain firm and steadfast on this path and consult regarding the promotion of God's Cause and its teaching, and act according to what is most beloved and excellent. The world is evanescent and whatsoever is witnessed therein shall return to nothingness - this is a truth to which minds, souls and tongues have borne and continue to bear witness. Therefore must the friends of God, exalted be His glory, turn to that which shall cause the salvation of the servants. Whatever is manifested today for the love of God - its recompense is preserved and treasured in the divine treasuries. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers to be lost. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveys greetings to all the friends of God. All the souls in that land who have attained unto the wine of divine knowledge are mentioned in God's presence. Their names, one by one, have descended from the Kingdom of grace, especially those souls who, for the love of God, have performed that which was heard to be accepted from the Tongue of Unity. This evanescent servant hopes that all may act unitedly and in harmony according to what is befitting this Day - namely, that they may turn their attention to the reformation of souls. The Command is in God's hands, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about Mashhadi 'Ali-Akbar and Aqa Siyyid Isma'il - upon them be Baha'u'llah's glory - being present from the land of K along with several others, and that Mashhadi 'Ali-Akbar and Jinab-i-Sabbagh specifically requested that mention of them be made before the Most Holy Court - all these matters were laid before the Divine Throne. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur: \"O My Name! We have turned toward them from this Most Exalted Station and have remembered them in such wise that were it to be cast upon the solid rock, the water of life would flow therefrom. Give them glad tidings from Me and remind them of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My mercy. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing. We counsel them to show forth supreme steadfastness in this Cause, such that no idle fancies shall hold them back from the Lord of all beings. Blessed be their faces, their ears, their eyes and their hands - they who have witnessed, heard, turned toward and taken hold of the Book of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Ask God, thy Lord, to protect them and to send down for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have arisen to serve God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\"\n\nThis lowly one conveys greetings and salutations to each one, and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to aid all to achieve that which leads to remembrance, awakening and salvation. Indeed, wonder upon wonder it is, for the Divine Call hath left its mark upon the solid rock, yet no trace thereof appeareth in the hearts of the heedless. The Command is in His hands; He doeth and decreeth as He willeth and as He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the Wise.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the arrival of the beloved of hearts, Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali - upon him be the glory of God and His favors - mention of him was the cause of boundless joy, for according to reports he returned from the mouth of the serpent and, praise be to God, remained protected. Detailed accounts of his experiences have arrived from every quarter, and you too have written that all people have testified and continue to testify to the impotence of their divines and the shortcomings of their leaders. Nevertheless, they remain occupied with these glorious veils and mighty barriers, heedless of and veiled from the light of the Divine Dayspring.\n\nThe mention of Mirza, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, has been repeatedly presented at the Most Holy Court. At each time He made mention of him in such ways that this servant is powerless to recount. This time these supreme words were revealed from the Dayspring of Names, exalted be His glory and might:\n\n\"Verily the Wronged One grieved at his grief and mentioned what befell him in His path. Through him God perfected His proof against those who wronged him. Soon will He seize them through His power and exalt his mention throughout the world. He is verily the Mighty, the Triumphant, and the Dominant over all who are in the heavens and earths. We have sent down what befell him and adorned it with the ornament of My favor, and I am the Powerful, the Mighty. We send greetings and glorification unto him and We shall send him a tablet hereafter, when God willeth and desireth. He is verily the Just, the Wise. The Glory be upon him and upon those with him, and woe unto those who wronged him without any proof from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\"\n\nPraise be to God that through him the mention of God was raised in those regions, and each of the loved ones has written and sent accounts of the events that transpired. His is the pearl, his the deed, the mention and the praise, and what befell him. This lowly one was blessed to receive his letter some time ago and it was presented at the Most Holy Court. Exalted Tablets were revealed specifically for the people of Mim, however due to the upheavals in this land and its surroundings they were not sent. God willing, they shall be sent in these days.\n\nAnd regarding the mention of Aqa Muhammad Javad, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, and likewise the mention of Aqa Abdul-Baqi, upon him be the Glory of God, which you had written at the end of your letter - these were presented before the presence of the Lord of Manifestation. This is what God revealed in response, blessed and exalted be He:\n\n\"O Javad! Give thanks unto God for having attained, visited, reached, witnessed and arisen to serve the Cause when the people were in evident fear. There hath appeared from thee in steadfastness a station which We have mentioned in the Crimson Scroll by My Most Exalted Pen. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to confirm thee in this. He is verily the Powerful, the Witness, the All-Knowing. We have mentioned thee time and again in this Book. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Generous. Be as thou wert before, firm and steadfast in such wise that the whispers of the heedless affect thee not. We have aided thee in My remembrance and service to My Cause. Know thou the station of this exalted station. Hold fast unto it in all conditions, detached from the world. Thus doth the Lord of Eternity command thee. He is verily the Ordainer, the Wise.\n\n\"And We make mention of Abdul-Baqi who emigrated and attained the presence of God, the Lord of the worlds. Remember when thou wert in the presence and didst hear the call of the Wronged One while imprisoned in this mighty fortress. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have clung to the hem of their Lord's grace, the Mighty, the Great.\"\n\nO My Name Mahdi! We have adorned the friends of God with the ornament of remembrance, and at the time of revelation all were present before Us, and We bear witness and make mention that, by My life, this is a great station. And those loved ones who were absent from that land were also blessed with mention from the Supreme Pen, and the servant present attained visitation on your behalf and was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Blessed art thou! The glory and praise be upon thee from Us and upon those who have cast aside what is with the people in hope of that which is with God, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nGod, exalted be His glory, made mention of that from which the fragrance of countless favors wafted. It is hoped that this letter, unlike previous submissions, will arrive quickly. Thus far, all of your letters that have been received have been answered. At this moment, when the utterance reached this point, the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - honored us with His presence and entrusted a sealed envelope to this evanescent one. Now I intend to open it and partake of the pearls of utterance concealed therein. Glory be to God! What a wonderful coincidence - before one feast was cleared away, another blessing descended. Blessed are we through the perpetuity of the Kingdom and the Realm of Might!\n\nGod willing, may this heavenly feast continue to rain down from the heaven of that Beloved One's love. Your letter dated the fourteenth of Dhu'l-Hijjah, numbered eight, shone forth like the light of nearness and reunion. Praise be to God! After offering thanks and praise, reading and reviewing it, I turned toward the Court of the Lord of creation and presented all before the Holy Presence. This is what was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance. His words, exalted be His glory, are these:\n\nPraise be to God! The signs of joy and gladness are evident and manifest from the cities and villages through which they have passed. Deeds done for God have a mighty effect; if their manifestation is delayed, it is due to wisdom. In any case, their effect will surely appear from God. God willing, you will strive with the utmost effort to promote unity and concord in the land of ?a and other lands, that perchance the horizons of the world may be illumined with that which God desires. Convey My greetings to Ali-Akbar and Ibn-i-Abhar and the other friends on behalf of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, all are blessed with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. God willing, may they be assisted to serve the Cause in such wise that no affair may prevent them from the straight path. Say: O friends of the Truth! Preserve your efforts and hold fast to that which promotes the Cause of God. If for a few days you forsake your desires in the path of the True Friend and cleave to that which is beloved in God's sight, there is no harm in this. Indeed, this matter appears very easy in the path of the Peerless Friend. God willing, may you be mentioned in the Book of God as helper and supporter. Verily, He is with you and commands you to that which profits you. The glory be upon you and upon them.\n\nThis evanescent servant had written replies to the letters of the friends, upon them be the glory of God, but was not able to send them. God willing, they will be sent these days, and he offers greetings to each one. To Zein in the land of B.R., after offering greetings, I submit that he has always been and continues to be in our thoughts. The servant, God willing, is adorned with the seal of faithfulness. During his presence he was not forgotten, and God willing, will not be forgotten.\n\nConcerning the arrival of Khan and Sheikh Abul-Qasim, upon them be the Glory of God, and likewise the arrival of the honored lady Aziyyih Khanum, praise be to God they have reached their homeland safely. All are remembered in the Most Holy Presence and are recipients of His favor. Khan and Sheikh, upon them be the Glory of God, have truly endured hardships. Their reward rests with and is preserved with God. If you meet them, convey greetings on behalf of this servant. Sheikh, upon him be the Glory of God, endured much hardship in tending the garden. Whenever this servant visits the small plot, he is reminded of him. It is hoped that the Hand of pre-existing Grace and Mercy will gather all beneath the shade of the Tree. The honored lady Aziyyih Khanum is remembered. This servant beseeches and implores God to assist that honored lady in that which is pleasing to the Friend. Praise be to God, she has attained the blessing of reunion and has drunk from the Kawthar of nearness. This station is most exalted. God willing, may she remain preserved through the Name of Truth.\n\nConcerning Haji Muhajir, the honored Nabil the traveler, upon him be the Glory of God, and the other friends and sons of Khalil and heirs of Kalim in the land of Ha and Mim, upon them be the Glory of God - all that you mentioned was presented before His Presence, and all were blessed with the effulgent lights of the Sun of God's favor, exalted be His glory. God willing, may they act according to what He loves and is pleased with. The mention of the sons of Khalil, upon them be the Glory of God, caused the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, to smile. He said: \"Blessed is he who was taken in the way of My Cause, and he who spoke the truth in the gathering to exalt My Cause, and those who attained the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty and aided the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" God willing, may they be illumined with the lights of steadfastness and speak in remembrance of Truth. The friends of that land, from before and after, have been and are recipients of divine favors. God willing, may they hold fast to wisdom and gaze toward the horizon of grace.\n\nAs for the mention of the honored photographer, it was most appropriate. All that his honor has accomplished in this journey has been accepted. In these days this servant is writing something to the land of Ra. Although after his honor's signature there was and is no need for this servant's receipt, nevertheless, in accordance with that beloved one's request, the receipt is being sent to the honored Andalib, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor.\n\nAt the end of your letter was the writing of the honored, cherished, and kind friend Samandar, the steed of the arena of utterance, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful. Complete joy and boundless delight were attained. Praise be to God, they are steadfast in serving the Cause and speaking in remembrance of Truth. Night and day they are occupied with mention and utterance in the Cause of the Desired One of all worlds. Of this there is no doubt or uncertainty. Upon him be God's peace, His glory, His favor, and His grace.\n\nAnd concerning the mention of the honored Nabil Jalil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful - it increased the light of vision and bestowed fresh vitality to the realm of the heart. God willing, may he remain confirmed, successful, safe and preserved, dwelling and resting in peace beneath the shadow of the favor of the Desired One of the world. Letters constantly arrive from the land of Kha. They have written the latest news, namely the passing of the mentioned person and the acceptance of some. According to what was mentioned, the condition of all is good. God willing, may they increase each day in love, acceptance, humility and submissiveness.\n\nConcerning what was written about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Asadu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, one of the Sadat of Khums, upon them be the Glory of God - mention of them was made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence and they attained the favors of God, exalted be His glory. They were mentioned before as well, and the passage they requested will be sent, God willing.\n\nAs for the mention made of my master Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad Darbaghi, upon him be the Glory of God - praise be to God, they are aflame with the fire of divine love, a flame to which God, exalted be His glory, Himself bears witness. By His very truth, this suffices him. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. They sent a letter to this servant which spoke of overwhelming longing, rapturous love, attention, devotion and detachment. Blessed is he, again blessed is he. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to confirm him in all conditions. Verily there is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nConcerning the mention made of Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-'Askar and Aqa Shir-'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God, who came solely to meet His Holiness - this was presented and He said their deed is accepted before God. Blessed are they both. They have attained to attention and devotion. We have mentioned them before and after with decisive verses, and We have revealed therein what they did in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings to them and give them glad tidings of God's favor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I beseech God to confirm them in that which will cause their mention and their deeds in His path to endure. Verily He is the Answerer of prayers.\n\nLikewise mention was made of Jinab-i-Mulla 'Ali and Haji Baba and Aqa Qasim, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented in the Most Holy Presence, they were honored with these exalted words - He says, exalted be His grandeur: \"O 'Ali! God willing, thou shalt hold fast to the cord of the Cause, detached from the world. Today whosoever attains to the Most Great Remembrance and drinks from the Kawthar of divine knowledge is reckoned among the people of Baha. Ages and centuries will not erase his mention. Know thou this and be of those who are steadfast. Then know the station of those with thee. Look not at that which is unseemly. Behold the horizon of My love and that which We have adorned with the ornament of Our favor. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Blessed art thou for having attained the mention of the Wronged One, Whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of life and the Point of Adoration of names and attributes. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous.\"\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Haji Baba and Aqa Qasim, upon them be the Glory of God: \"O My Name! We make mention of him who hath turned to My horizon, heard My call and stood before My gate. We give him glad tidings of God's grace and mercy, and We beseech Him to confirm him in all conditions and draw him nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. And We make mention of Qasim who hath turned towards the Countenance. We mentioned him before as a bounty from Us. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We send Our greetings from this station upon him and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords, at Whose appearance the limbs of names trembled, save whom God willed, the Supreme, the All-Compelling.\"\n\nPraise be to God, all have attained to the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of favor. No name remaineth but it hath been mentioned by His Most Exalted Pen, and no deed but its reward hath been written in the Book of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. Repeatedly this evanescent one hath conveyed and continues to convey greetings and salutations to the friends.\n\nThe supplication of this evanescent one in the presence of that true spiritual beloved is that should you turn towards the Land of Sad and inhale its air which is mingled with the love of the Beloved of the worlds, you should, on behalf of this mere nothingness, visit the Twin Luminous Lights, upon them be the glory of God and the ocean of His bounty and the lights of His countenance. This is the ultimate desire. Verily your reward and recompense rest with God, our Lord and your Lord. At this time, after turning to the ultimate goal and attaining the presence before the Throne, He said: Write in My name to Mahdi and convey My greetings to the people of Sad, both the immigrants and the residents. Gladden the household with divine favors. Give glad tidings of God's grace and favor, exalted be His glory, to those related to the Twin Lights. The sister of the King of Martyrs, upon her be the glory of God, has thus far sent several petitions. Should you meet Sadiq, upon him be my glory, convey greetings to him from God. Say: Behold and then remember when God elevated the station of the Twin Lights in this world and the next. Be steadfast in this and keep your gaze fixed upon His horizon, and remain firm in service to His Cause. Verily He will be with you and will aid you in all conditions. He is indeed the Powerful, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. If the sister has any rights, they should be fulfilled. O Sadiq, upon you be My glory! Hold fast to that which today is the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. Verily He ordains for you that whereby your station will be elevated among the people. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. Be vigilant in all aspects regarding the family of the King of Martyrs and conduct yourself with the utmost joy and fragrance in their presence. All should be pleased with you. Verily your Lord is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, and the Compassionate, the Generous. He commands you to that which benefits you in the next world and in this. He is indeed the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. Convey greetings to Asad, upon him be My glory. God willing, may he remain firm in service to the Cause and be engaged in settling the affairs of the loved ones of God. It ends. It is evident that this evanescent one also expects that you will, on his behalf, convey greetings and glory to the household, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God. May the glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you and hear your words, and upon all who are steadfast and upright. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, the All-Wise.\n\n=== END BH00063 ===\n\n=== START BH00064 ===\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! How can the pen move and the ink flow after the breezes of loving-kindness have been cut off, and the sun of tribulation has dawned from the horizon of divine decree, and the sword of calamity has emerged from the sheath of God's command, and the heaven of sorrows has been raised up, and from the clouds of destiny have rained down the spears of trials and the arrows of retribution, to such extent that the stars of joy have set in the hearts of Thy loved ones and the measures of gladness have vanished from the hearts of Thy chosen ones, and afflictions have followed one upon another until they reached a station wherein none can bear them and no soul can approach them, whereby the gates of hope were shut and the breezes of faithfulness were cut off and the winds of extinction arose. By Thy glory! The pen weeps and the ink laments and the tablet is thunderstruck and bodies tremble and pillars are demolished. Alas, alas for what has been ordained and decreed, and this is from Thy primary loving-kindness!\n\nAnd Thou art the One Who didst light the lamps of love in the niche of providence and nourished them with the oil of knowledge and wisdom until they shone forth and gave light, and by their light the lights of Thy oneness shone forth in the niche of the glory of Thy sovereignty and the pillars of the house of Thine eternity were made firm in the gardens of the sanctity of Thine Essence, and Thou didst preserve them with the glass of Thy grace and the crystal of Thy mercy lest disturbing winds should blow upon them, and after that Thou didst clothe them with the garment of Thy generosity and compassion and didst manifest them from the kingdom of Thy attributes in the temple of Thy names. Then, when their creation was complete and their nature refined, the winds of extinction blew upon them and the breezes of eternity were cut off from them until their life was taken and their niche was broken and their lights were extinguished. Alas, alas for what has been ordained and decreed, and this is from Thine other decrees\\[...\\]\n\nAnd Thou art, O my Lord, He Who hath lit the lamp of mercy and the lights of Thy guidance in the places of bounty and grace, and nourished them with the oils of Thy knowledge and wisdom, until by their light were illumined the lamps of guidance in the chambers of Thy glory, and through them were revealed the lights of Thy oneness from the lanterns of Thy grandeur and dominion. Thou didst preserve them from the violent winds that extinguish, that they might remain sheltered beneath the shade of Thy mercy. Then Thou didst clothe them with the garments of Thine immortality and didst manifest them from the kingdom of attributes in the temple of one of Thy names. And when its creation was complete and its character perfected, the adverse winds of extinction blew upon it and the gates of perpetuity were shut before it, to such extent that its light was extinguished, its lantern shattered, its place emptied, and its radiance vanished. Alas, alas for that which was decreed and made manifest! This is from Thine irrevocable decree, O my Lord.\n\nHow can I recount, O my God, the wonders of Thy handiwork and the mysteries of Thy wisdom, how Thou didst create from the essences of bounty the pearly water, and caused it to flow through the loins of fathers, transferring it from loin to loin until it reached the back of one of Thy servants. Then Thou didst cause this pure and subtle water to descend into the shell of one of Thy handmaidens, and didst nurture it therein by the hands of Thy mystery and the subtleties of Thy mercy, and didst order it by the ordinances of Thy wisdom, until Thou didst form it in the mother's womb in a noble form and most excellent shape. Then after this Thou didst bring it forth and nurse it and bestow favors upon it and nourish it and give it to drink and honor it and exalt it and strengthen it and cause it to grow until Thou didst bring it to a limit that hath no limit in Thy creation and to a height that hath no end among Thy creatures, such that Thou didst cause it to ascend to the heaven of Thy Cause and the atmosphere of Thy holy might, and didst bring it to the heights of journeying before Thee, and didst separate it from all directions and return it from Thee unto Thee until it arrived before Thee and descended with Thee. But O my God, upon its arrival before Thee, Thou didst strip its body for Thou loved naught else, and took its garments for Thou desired nothing but it, and caused it to dwell in a house wherein was neither companion nor friend nor associate nor intimate nor lamp nor bed, and it remained therein poor, needy, alone, seeking protection. Alas! Alas! Thereby were cut off the breezes of honor from the precincts of immortality, and the dove of the Cause grew weary of the melodies of faithfulness, and existence rent its yellow garments from its form, and the celestial maidens cast dust upon their faces, and the eyes of grandeur wept crimson tears in the inner recesses of all possibility. Alas! Alas! That which was ordained came to pass, and this is among Thy supreme afflictions.\n\nO my Beloved and my Purpose! How can I recount Thy consummate wisdom in the manifestations of Thy new creation, and the mysteries of Thy sovereignty and providence that are veiled from the eyes of men and sanctified from the comprehension of minds? Thus didst Thou create from the essences of Thy bounties a subtle, luminous water, and caused it to flow in spiritual loins, transferring it from loin to loin and from place to place, until it was established in the back of one of Thy servants. Then didst Thou cause it to descend from his back into the shell of one of Thy handmaidens, and nurtured it through Thy hidden hands and the subtle emanations of Thy grace and mercy, until Thou didst create it in the mother's womb in a form of nobility and greatness, and adorned it with the most excellent form. Thou didst nourish it with pure milk and preserve it through Thy perfect power until it grew up in the precincts of Thy mercy and dwelt in the realms of Thy dominion, tasting the wines of Thy generosity and drinking from the springs of Thy grace, until it entered the garden of recognition and found repose in the abode of certitude, wandering in the meadows of nearness and witnessing, and treading upon the carpet of union and revelation, until it was honored with the glory of meeting Thee and was sustained by the wine of immortality, plucking the fruit of nearness from the tree of reunion and drinking the pure water from the fountain of beauty, perceiving the flow of divine knowledge from the peerless countenance of the Eternal Lord, and traversing the realms of love and the paths of the wilderness of patience and search until it arrived at Thy presence and returned unto Thee and came back to Thee and dwelt at the pole of placelessness facing Thy beauty. At this time the sea of Thy decree surged and the fierce winds arose in the atmosphere of Thy trials. Then didst Thou strip its body and humble its frame, and lodge it in a house wherein no carpet was spread and no lamp was lit, with no companion to associate with and no friend to take comfort in. Alas, alas! The signs of joy were sealed, the nightingale of manifestation was silenced, the essence of being rent its garments, and the Maiden of Paradise cast black dust upon her head, and from the springs of power flowed rivers of abasement. Alas, alas, for that which appeared and became manifest! This is among Thy great calamities, O my Lord!\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my God! After Thou didst cause him to ascend unto the fields of eternity in the All-Glorious Realm, and to become detached from his own self, and to abide through the Most Exalted Light in the pavilions of eternity, and to attain unto Thee, and to know his own self, and to declare Thy light, and to perceive Thy beauty, Thou didst give him to drink from the wondrous crystal springs of Thy hidden knowledge, and didst clothe him with the robe of guidance, and didst cause him to drink from the chalices of righteousness until he heard the melody of the Dove in the midmost heart of eternity, and stood before the Greatest Vision, and arose before the Sanctuary of Grandeur, and held fast to the Yellow Cord in the Crimson Spot, and became independent through his own essence, and endured through his own reality, and witnessed with his own eyes what he witnessed, and knew in his heart what he knew, and ascended in his entirety to that station wherein none hath preceded him in his love for Thee and his contentment with Thy decree and his submission to Thy trials, and he attained that most exalted condition and that most glorious and sublime station, until Thou didst breathe upon him the breaths of Thy decree and the winds of Thy trials, and didst take from him all that Thou hadst bestowed upon him through Thy bounty, such that his feet were prevented from walking, and his hands from grasping, and his sight from beholding Thy beauty, and his hearing from hearkening to Thy melodies, and his heart from knowing the manifestations of Thy oneness, and his soul from being assured of the Dawning-Places of Thy singleness. And Thou wert not content with this until Thou didst strip from him the robes of Thy loving-kindness and bring him down from the palaces of glory to the dust of abasement, and from the treasury of wealth to the abode of poverty, and he dwelt in the bowels of the earth, alone, a stranger, naked, deprived and forsaken. Alas, alas, for what was decreed and executed! And this was from Thy greatest calamity.\n\n\\[Strange it is that after his entry into the garden of immortality, and his partaking of the chalices of eternity, and his soaring in the heaven of eternity, and his attainment unto the retreats of immortality, and his arrival at that station wherein naught was visible save immortality itself and naught existed save the essence of ancient glory, the hosts of annihilation surrounded him from all sides until they seized him. Ponder ye on this, O people of the Bayan, for fifty thousand years, if ye be firmly grounded in the knowledge of God. Nay, by my Lord! Ye shall not understand, even should ye ponder from all eternity.\\]\n\nGlorified and sanctified art Thou, O my Best Beloved! After Thou didst exalt him to the sublime stations of the Paradise of glory and didst cause him to enter the holy gardens of immortality where the gates of mortality were never opened unto him - until he became detached from his own self and remained steadfast in Thy perpetuity, and entered the garden of reunion, and drank from the fountain of beauty, and comprehended the essences of knowledge and the realities of wisdom from hidden springs, and donned the garments of guidance, and tasted from the cups of piety, and heard the melodies of the divine Dove from celestial harps and lutes, and severed himself from all else and clung unto Thy presence, and laid his head in submission upon the plains of nearness unto Thee, until he laid down his life in the wilderness of search - then didst Thou take from him that which Thou hadst bestowed, until his feet ceased from walking, and his hands from moving, and his eyes were veiled from beholding Thy beauty, and his ears were debarred from hearing Thy utterance, and Thou didst take from him the robes of Thy mercy, until he fell naked and bare upon the dust, and from lofty palaces of glory took up abode in the house of abasement, and from exalted stations of wealth settled upon the earth of poverty, and remained alone upon the ground, a stranger, solitary and poor. Therefore, alas, alas, for that which hath appeared and become manifest! This is among Thy great afflictions, O my Lord!\n\nThou art He Who planted a goodly tree in a blessed and delicate soil, and watered it with camphor water from the springs of manifestation, and nurtured it through the power of Thy sovereignty, and preserved it by the hands of Thy might, until it grew tall and was exalted, and Thou didst make its roots firm in the earth of Thy Will through one of Thy names, and its branches in the heaven of Thy Purpose, and it became established and elevated, possessing lofty boughs and exalted branches, and mighty and impregnable limbs, and upon its boughs dwelt the spirits of Thy glorious Essence, and upon its branches reposed the doves of Thy eternal holiness, and cages of light were suspended therein, wherein were singing birds of glory and sanctified doves warbling - all of them remembering God their Lord with wondrous tongues in melody and with mighty words upon the branches, and by their songs were the hearts of the sincere ones carried away and the souls of those near unto Thee made tranquil. But when it reached its loftiest station, the thunderbolts of Thy wrath and the tempests of Thy tribulation seized it, until its branches were broken, and its leaves turned yellow, and its fruits fell, and its cages were shattered, and its birds flew away, until it fell entirely, both root and branch, as though it had never been planted, never been created, never appeared, never risen, and never been elevated. Alas! Alas! It is finished and done, and this is from the power of Thy supreme sovereignty.\n\nO my Lord! Thou didst plant the goodly tree of grace in blessed and fertile soil, and with hands of loving-kindness didst thou nurture it, preserving it beneath the shadow of Thy might and power, until its branches grew tall and its boughs bore fruit, its roots struck deep in the earth of divine knowledge, and its crown reached unto the heaven of wisdom. Upon its leaves did settle the holy spirits of Thy grace, and upon its branches did rest the glorious lights of Thy bounty, and in its boughs did dwell the birds of attraction and yearning and the nightingales of love and longing, whose Hijazi melodies and Iraqi songs and divine harmonies so enchanted the sanctified souls and near ones that they transcended the bounds of existence. But when its time was fulfilled, the thunderbolts of Thy wrath encompassed it, such that its branches were broken, its leaves turned yellow, its fruits were scattered, its cages shattered, its birds took flight, and it fell upon the face of the earth as though it had never been created, never appeared, and never borne fruit. Alas, alas for what was decreed and made manifest! Such are the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, O my Lord!\n\nThou art He Who sent down the decree of power from the heaven of might, and by Thy leave did shine forth the command of destiny in the kingdom of creation, that the spot of grandeur might rest upon pillars of steel most firm and sure. Thou didst fashion it from the soil of grace from Thy eternal paradise, and didst build it upon four pillars from the temples of Thy transcendent glory, adorning it with the suns of Thy divinity and embellishing it with the pure gold of Thy mercy. Its gates Thou didst make to shine with crimson ruby in Thy Most Exalted Name, and its walls Thou didst stud with the pearls of Thy highest attributes in Thy Most Great and Most Glorious Remembrance. Its roof and throne Thou didst fashion of purest diamond in the Most Perfect, Most Ancient and Most Faithful Remembrance. Glory be to God, its Creator, its Fashioner, its Manifestor, and its Ordainer! And after it reached its fullness and appeared in most beauteous form, it endured until its appointed time was fulfilled. Then arose the heaven of Thy trial in the divine realm of Thy might, and the angels of Thy wrath pronounced upon it the word of Thy chastisement. The foundation of the house was shaken until its pillars fell, its thrones collapsed, its gates were destroyed, its walls crumbled, and its signs were effaced, as though it had never been built upon Thy earth, never raised in Thy domains, never appeared in Thy lands - to such degree that its dust was scattered, its memory forgotten, and its traces obliterated. Alas, alas for what was decreed and carried out! Such are the wonders of Thy most exalted ordination, and praise be unto Thee for the excellence of Thy most sweet decree.\n\nO my Master and my Hope! From the Kingdom of might Thou didst send down the firm decree of fate, and from the pavilions of power the irrevocable command of destiny, for the building of a house wherein troubled souls might dwell and wherein pure minds might find rest. Thou didst build it of holy and goodly soil, from a single grain of which were created the realities of the exalted ones and the hearts of the sanctified. Upon divine pillars didst Thou establish its foundations, and with suns rising from the horizon of beauty didst Thou adorn it. Thou didst embellish it with pure gold, and didst ornament its gates with wondrous rubies created from the essence of identity. Thou didst bedeck its walls with lofty pearls that had appeared from the depths of the sea of oneness. And when its construction was complete, and its signs were manifest, and its tokens were revealed, Thou didst command all who soared in the heavens of Thy power and moved in the atmosphere of Thy glory to circle round it, to visit its precincts, and to approach its gates. Rejected was he who tarried, and accepted was he who drew nigh. Then when its time was fulfilled and its decree was accomplished, the clouds of tribulation rose from the dayspring of might and wrath, and the angels of divine punishment uttered a word that caused the pillars of that house to quake, such that its foundations crumbled, its roofs collapsed, and its signs were obliterated, as though it had never been built nor ever raised up, to such extent that its name was forgotten, its dust scattered, and its traces effaced. Alas, alas, for that which came to pass and was made manifest! Such are the wonders of Thy supreme ordainments, O my Lord, and I praise Thee for the sweetness of Thy divine decree, O my God!\n\nBy Thy glory, O my God! I do not complain to Thee of that which hath befallen me from Thee and descended from Thy presence. Rather, I seek Thy forgiveness for all that I have uttered, related, and spoken concerning my transgressions, which tell of naught save my heedlessness of Thy remembrance and my turning away from the gardens of Thy nearness. For I have recognized the seats of Thy wisdom and become aware of the measures of Thy glorious sovereignty, and am assured that through the power of Thy grace, Thou wilt not deal with Thy servants except in accordance with what befitteth the glory of Thy majesty and beseemeth the wonders of Thy favors. The decree of return from the horizon of Thy power and the dominion of Thy will hath not been ordained save for that which leadeth Thy servants to the ultimate goal of Thy grace and the highest ranks of Thy bounty and generosity. I know that he who hath ascended unto Thee and descended upon Thee hath risen to the heavens of Thine eternal glory and dwelleth in the precincts of Thy holy sovereignty, and is established upon the throne of glory at the dawning of the lights of Thy beauty, and reposeth on the couch of immortality at the manifestation of the might of Thy divinity. It is as if I now behold him soaring on wings of glory in the atmosphere of Thy holy mercy, traversing the cities of the spirit of Thy oneness, drinking from the chalices of Thy reunion and meeting, and being nourished by the bounties of Thy nearness and attainment. How blessed is that most glorious honor and that supreme favor! And since Thou hast concealed from Thy creation that which Thou hast revealed unto Thy servant, the decree of separation hath become grievous unto Thy servants, and the manifestation of severance from the horizon of parting hath become difficult for Thy bondsmen, and the appearance of evanescence in the temples of eternity hath become arduous for Thy loved ones. And thereby there hath descended upon Thy loved ones that which no one can reckon, no soul can encompass, no heart can endure, and no mind can bear. Among these is this calamity that hath befallen, this catastrophe that hath occurred, whereby hearts have been consumed and beings set ablaze and lands convulsed. No eye remaineth but hath wept, no head but hath been laid bare, no soul but hath been perturbed, no heart but hath been troubled, no light but hath been darkened, no spirit but hath been cut off, and no joy but hath been transformed. Alas, alas, for that which hath been decreed and carried out! And this is from Thy decree, inscribed upon the Crimson Tree.\n\nI swear by Thy glory and majesty, O my Lord, my Guide, and my Beloved, that I do not complain to Thee of what hath proceeded from Thy presence and appeared from Thy direction. Rather, the heads of Thy lovers seek Thy strong cords, and the necks of them that yearn for Thy face await Thy sharp swords, and the illumined breasts, through attraction and longing, await Thy poison-tipped arrows. Deadly poisons are sweeter to the lovers than the water of life, and fatal wounds are purer than refined and delicate drinks. May that soul perish which doth not sacrifice its life in the path of Thy love, and may that being be lost which doth not cast away its head in search of union with Thee. May that heart die which is not quickened by Thy remembrance, and may that frame be distanced which seeketh not with its soul to draw near to Thee and tasteth not the hardships of the wilderness of love.\n\nYet, O my Master, I turn in repentance for having occupied myself in Thy holy court with these words, which have appeared only through this servant's heedlessness of the stations of nearness and union. For whosoever attaineth unto Thee remaineth detached from all else, and whosoever passeth beyond Thee becometh occupied with other than Thee. Woe, therefore, unto him who severeth himself from Thee and attacheth himself to another, who remaineth bewildered in the valley of self and dieth, and is deprived of the City of eternal life and everlasting existence.\n\nBy Thy glory and majesty, O my Lord, I witness that the friends and intimates of the Kaaba of Thy union, and they that are inebriated with the wine of Thy beauty, are enraptured by the wonders of Thy decree and rejoice in the trials that descend from Thy presence, whether they be pure wrath or absolute anger. For this wrath is the master of favors, and this anger the sovereign of mercies, and this poison the quickener of souls. The heaven of might circleth this abasement, and the kingdom of wealth seeketh this poverty.\n\nAnd Thou, O my Master, hast caused this bird to return from the darkened body to the divine realm, where it hath been sustained by spiritual sustenance and blessed with celestial bounties. It hath returned unto Thee and arrived before Thee, ascending to the holy heights and finding repose in the precincts of Thy mercy, established upon the seat of glory. It soareth in the atmosphere of might and spirit, drinking from the wines of Thy Divine unity and the cups of meeting with Thy Eternal Self.\n\nSince Thou hast, through Thy consummate wisdom, veiled these stations behind the curtains of Thy power, therefore the decree of separation hath become difficult for Thy servants, and the command of divorce hard upon them. Souls are brought to lamentation at its contemplation, and minds to terror at its witnessing. Among these destined trials and great hidden calamities is this novel tribulation and this new affliction, whereby hearts are consumed and the realities of servants set ablaze, and the people of all lands are disturbed. No eye remaineth that hath not shed tears of blood, no heart surviveth that hath not tasted the cup of sorrow. The heads of the lofty are laid bare and exposed, and the souls of the content are lamenting in grief. Hearts are troubled and lights are darkened.\n\nAnd souls became content with lamentation, hearts were troubled, lights became dark and obscure, spirit was severed from its abodes, and joy was transformed from its gatherings. Then woe, woe unto that which appeared and became manifest! And this is from Thy firm decrees concerning the Tree of Thy Manifestation, O my Lord.\n\n\"O my God, my Beloved, my Hope! Thou knowest that calamities have showered from the horizon of destiny and encompassed all creation and all that is therein, and overwhelmed the worlds and whatsoever pertaineth unto them. Yet in these days Thou hast specially ordained them for two countenances, naming the first after her whom Thou didst single out and make the mother of all creation, and the other after her whom Thou didst choose above all women of the world. And when these trials descended upon them, they had no mother to rend her garments, or cast ashes upon her head, or share their grief, or weep at their afflictions, or bare her head at what had befallen them. Neither had they companions to console them and stay their tears, nor maidens to dry the tears from their cheeks, nor virgins to cover their hair, nor sympathizers to calm their agitation, weep at their tribulations, dye their hands or comb their hair after their bereavement.\n\nTherefore, O my God, since Thou hast decreed by Thy command what Thou hast decreed, and fulfilled by Thy will what Thou hast fulfilled, bestow Thy grace upon them and clothe them in silken robes and radiant garments with the word of glorification, that their eyes may be solaced by the wonders of Thy mercy and their grief transformed by the jewels of Thy joy and the lights of radiance from the Mount of Thy manifestation. Then cause them to hear the melodies of Thy divine reality from the Lote-Tree of Thine eternal might and the Tree of Thy oneness - melodies at whose hearing minds are thunderstruck, souls stirred, and spirits drawn forth in their revelation.\n\nThen grant them fruits from the tree of Thy divinity and give them to taste the wine of life from the springs of Thy unity. Place them in the stream of Thy nearness and the city of Thy reunion, and shelter them in the vicinity of Thy mercy beneath the shade of the garden of Thy presence and communion. Then pour forth patience upon them from Thy presence, and make them and those who were with them to be reliant upon Thee, detached from all else but Thee, occupied with Thy remembrance, intimate with Thy name, yearning for Thy beauty, hastening toward Thy reunion and meeting, sustained from the chalice of Thy bounty, circling round Thy Being, reclining in the cradle of Thy nearness, soaring in the heaven of Thy love, walking in the lands of Thy good-pleasure, running to the hiding-place of Thy lights, seeking the excellence of Thy decree, content with the descent of Thy trials, patient in Thee, and pleased with Thee.\n\nMay their eyes be expectant for the wonders of Thy mercy and their hearts await the appearance of Thy grace, for they have taken no lord besides Thee, no beloved other than Thee, and no goal except Thee. I beseech Thee by Him Whom Thou didst manifest before and Whom Thou wilt manifest hereafter, that Thou deprive not them and Thy servants from the sanctuary of Thy grandeur, nor turn them away from the gates of the City before whose courtyard all who are in the heavens and earth have gathered and stood at its door, though none entered therein save those whom Thou didst single out through Thy bounty and make mirrors of Thy Self, manifestations of Thy Being, daysprings of Thy glory, dawning-places of Thy holiness, settings of Thy spirit, repositories of Thy revelation, hiding-places of Thy light, oceans of Thy knowledge, and waves of Thy wisdom. Thus hast Thou been powerful over what Thou willest and sovereign over what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThen raise up, O my God, this Guest who hath come unto Thee above what Thou hast raised through Thy bounty, until he arrives in the pavilions of grandeur behind the tabernacles of oneness in the vicinity of Thy Most Glorious Name and Thy Most Exalted Self at the Furthermost Tree.\"\n\nMay Thy most exalted Being approach the Ultimate Tree, the Garden of Refuge, and may Thy most resplendent Spirit be taken by the holy fragrances from the Primal Point, the Most High Center, and the Sweetest Essence, that it may circle round His beauty, circumambulate the sanctuary of His grandeur, and visit the light of His attributes in the Kaaba of His names. Then clothe it with the robes of joy that it may thereby be concealed in the Concourse of Revelation and hear the melodies of nearness from the Camphor Tree, whereupon the white dove shall warble with the song of rapture upon this crimson leaf, and in all the trees with the song of the Almighty from this Flame ignited from this Fire, that verily there is no God but Him, the King, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Compeller, and that verily He is God, the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the All-Compelling. And thereupon the Word shall be sealed with \"Praise be to God, the Single, the All-Powerful.\" And Thou shalt decree, O my God, what is hoped for, and this is from Thy most perfect, most ancient, and most faithful bounty.\n\nVerily, Thou seest, O my Beloved, how calamities and tribulations have emerged from the dayspring of destiny, how the rains of wrath have poured down from all directions, and how the winds of sorrow have begun to blow. Many countless souls have been sacrificed in the path of the Friend, and how many illustrious heads have been raised upon the gallows. Not for a moment was there rest, nor for a night was there tranquility. The noose of Thy love has bound the heads of the mystics, and the arrow of Thy affection has pierced the hearts of the lovers.\n\nFourteen years have passed during which comfort has been cut off and the gates of rest have been closed. Neither have they partaken of the bounties of earthly dominion, nor have they perceived a breath from the mercy of the Spirit. At times they were afflicted with the abasement of imprisonment, at times concealed in the wilderness of separation. From every homeland were they cast out, from every country were they expelled, and from every comfort were they deprived. How many strong cords were severed, and how many firm handles were cut asunder! From every portion were they rendered portionless, and from every share did they remain shareless.\n\nThe bounties of kingdoms were transformed into the vengeance of destruction. The Sun of the dawning-places of divinity was concealed in the setting-places of obscurity. The Lamp of Lordship became hidden within the glass of hearts, the eternal Fire remained concealed in the Tree of Mystery, the Pearl of Oneness remained treasured in the Shell of the Unseen, and the Manifestation of Divinity remained hidden behind the veil of holiness.\n\nHow then can the pen inscribe or utterance take a step? And Thou, O my Lord and my Master, art aware of what hath befallen this servant and what hath descended upon him. Not for a moment has he found rest in a secure place, nor for an instant has he settled in a station of glory. No water has he drunk save the blood of the heart, and no food has he been provided save pieces of his own liver.\n\nAt times a captive of the infidels and wandering through cities, at times companion to chains and fetters. Especially in these days when he has become the target of the arrows of two parties and the object of vengeance of two factions. The friends derive glory from my abasement and joy from my sorrow, while the enemies harbor rancor in their hearts from my existence. Many are the hatreds concealed in breasts, and what enmities are hidden in hearts.\n\nHaving emerged from outward imprisonment, he has become imprisoned by the souls of the idolaters. The arrows of suspicion rain down from all directions, and the swords of envy pour forth from all sides like falling rain. Yet despite all these afflictions, trials, and firm tribulations, there remains hope that he shall not cease from service, that his foot shall not slip from steadfastness, and that his eyes shall stand in service in place of his feet.\n\nAt this moment, when tears flow from my cheeks and crimson blood courses from my heart, I call upon Thee to make my grieving heart heedless of all save Thee and occupied with Thee alone, that it may be severed from all else and attached to Thee. For he who is bound to Thee shall never be severed, and he who is accepted by Thee shall never be rejected. He is a sovereign though he be condemned by the servants, victorious though none may help him, and beloved though he be rejected.\n\nAt this moment the lamp of unity is kindled, and the mirror of oneness tells tales of the temple of detachment.\n\nThe mirror of oneness tells of the temple of detachment, and the reed-flute of Iraq plays in the melody of Hijaz the verse \"All things perish save His face.\" For the hands of the mystics fall short while Thou art established in Thy lofty sanctuary of glory, and the hearts of lovers are agitated while Thou remainest, in utmost independence, firm upon the treasury of exaltation. How can imagination find its way to soar in that vast heaven? And how can thought gain access to tread in the arena of sacred evanescence? The vain fancies of men are as dust, and how can dark and troubled dust reach the hem of sacred purity, or the limited gaze fall upon Thy luminous countenance? From time immemorial Thou hast been unknown, though more manifest than any manifestation, and Thou shalt ever remain concealed, though more renowned in all things than the things themselves. Such is Thy hiddenness in revelation and Thy manifestation in mysteries. Yea, O my Beloved! Not every breast is worthy of Thy love, nor every heart fit for Thy affection. Thy love is a blazing fire and the bodies of men are as dry wood. How can wood find rest or stability near fire unless Thy ancient grace takes a step forward and raises the banner of \"Be thou cool and safe,\" so that the Pen of Power may inscribe the mark of Thy love upon the luminous tablet of the heart. This is of Thy ancient grace which Thou bestowest upon whom Thou willest among Thy servants.\n\nI swear by Thy glory, O my Lord, that all these tribulations are sweeter than any honey and more pleasing than any spirit, for the seekers of the Ka'bah of reunion will not rejoice in the manifestation of Beauty until they pass beyond the bounds of majesty, and will not reach the fountain of eternity until they drink from the cup of evanescence, and will not be honored with the exalted robe of wealth until they don the garment of poverty in the path of Thy good-pleasure, and will not find the abode of healing until they become ill from the pain of love, and will not ascend to the holy homeland until they depart from the earthly dwelling, and will not attain eternal life until they die in the desert of everlasting search, and will not find the way to the heaven of glory until they take refuge in the land of abasement, and will not be sustained by the honey of eternity until they taste the poison of separation, and will not find rest in the realms of nearness and union until they traverse the wilderness of remoteness and separation.\n\nO my Lord! Although tribulations have encompassed all Thy loved ones, in these days they have especially befallen two of Thy handmaidens, one named Eve and the other Mary. This supreme affliction descended at a time when these handmaidens had no mother to rend her garments, to cast black dust upon her head, and to weep for the sorrow that had befallen them; no companions to dry their faces from the tears of their eyes and to cover their hair from the dark dust; no compassionate ones to console their grief and bring joy to their hearts; and no intimate friends to keep them company and, after their affliction, to dye their hands with henna and comb their tresses. They have drunk from cups of blood and been sustained by the food of grief.\n\nAnd Thou hast nourished them with the food of grief, and as Thou didst ordain, O my Lord, whatsoever Thou didst will, and didst cause to flow the irrevocable decree of destiny in whatsoever Thou didst desire. Therefore, O my Beloved, clothe them with the garments of patience and forbearance, and the vestures of mercy and tolerance, that their eyes may be illumined by Thy fresh mercies, and their hearts be tranquillized by Thine infinite favors. Cause them to enter the rivers of nearness and the cities of reunion, and give shelter to these homeless ones in the precincts of Thy mercy and beneath the pleasant shadows of Thy forgiveness and pardon. Grant repose to these troubled ones in Thy holy gatherings, and give these thirsty ones to drink from the waters of the hidden Kawthar and from the stored wine of immortality. Waft upon them the sweet-scented breezes of the Yemen of Thy love, and cause them to enter the cities of intimate companionship with Thee, that they may become remote from all except Thee and draw nigh unto Thee, become occupied with Thy remembrance and enraptured by Thy mention. May they plant the tree of Thy love in the luminous soil of the heart and water it with the waters of Thy love until its stature becomes lofty and its branches yield fruit, that they may remain firm in Thy love and steadfast therein, that they may walk in the land of Thy good-pleasure and find their abode in the cradles of Thy nearness, that they may traverse the wilderness of union with Thee and soar in the heavens of Thy presence, that they may pass beyond all limitations and attain unto the precincts of unity, and become exalted through the breaths of singleness in the realm of detachment, that they may close their eyes to all else and open them to Thee, flee from all else and enter Thy presence. Therefore, O my Master, bestow Thy favors upon them and upon this new guest who hath come before Thee, from that which hath been mentioned and that which hath been left unmentioned, and from that which is sanctified and exempt from these two aspects. Soon wilt Thou bestow that whereunto Thou hast been called. This proceedeth from Thy perfect bounty which hath preceded all created things, O my Lord.\n\n=== END BH00064 ===\n\n=== START BH00065 ===\n\nO Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!\n\nOn the 29th of Rabi'u'l-Avval 1300\n\nIn the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!\n\nThe denizens of the Kingdom bear witness that the Lord of the Celestial Dominion hath come with such sovereignty that before it nothing that is seen or witnessed can stand. He, verily, is the One Who was recorded in the Books of God, our Purpose and the Purpose of all who dwell on earth and in heaven. Yet when He came, all in the realm of creation turned away, save those who hearkened unto the Call and, forsaking all earthly things, turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon. These are they who are of the Ark mentioned by the Tongue of Unity in the Qayyumu'l-Asma. He it is Who gave glad tidings unto all of It and of those who would sail therein. Blessed are they who hastened after they heard, who responded after they recognized, and who found after they turned unto Him. These are God's chosen ones on earth and His pure ones throughout the lands. All things bear witness unto them even as the Tongue of Grandeur hath borne witness unto them. These are honored servants, these are sincere servants. These are they whom neither the howling of the wolf deterred from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, nor did the hissing serpent that glides frighten them from that which they purposed in the path of God, the Lord of existence.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O God of the world! Thou seest and knowest that this servant desired to make mention of one of Thy chosen ones who arose to serve Thy Cause and to aid that which Thou didst purpose in Thy dominion, though I know that my mention befitteth him not - how much less Thy sovereignty and majesty! I testify, O my God, that by Thy leave he turned unto all horizons and by Thy will he faced all directions, until there appeared from him that which Thy knowledge had anticipated. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the power which none save Thyself hath comprehended, to aid him in that which he hath purposed in Thy days for the exaltation of Thy Word. Assist him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, then protect him from those who have violated Thy Covenant, turned away from Thy Beauty, and denied Thy proof and Thy evidence. Thou art He, O my God, through Whom power and its dominion, might and its sovereignty were manifested. Thou rulest through Thy sovereignty as Thou pleasest, and Thou art the Ruler, the Commander, the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nO beloved of my heart and he who is mentioned in my soul! By God's life, the wine of thy remembrance hath intoxicated me, which the chosen ones of the verdant land and those around it caused me to hear. Among that which they say is that thou didst, with thy finger in the land of Qaf and Vav, loose the bonds when a wolf from among the wolves who denied the beginning and the return rose up against thee, when the All-Giving appeared riding upon the clouds. Blessed is he who arose to aid you, assist you, and protect you from the evil of the essence of wickedness. He hath attained unto that which none hath comprehended save God, my Purpose and thy Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and earths. However, this servant is ashamed to have exceeded the bounds of moderation. The exalted and all-knowing Truth beareth witness that thou hast ever been in my heart and before my sight. After reading thy numerous letters, on the wings of love, affection, longing and yearning, I turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and after gaining permission and attaining the presence before His countenance, this was submitted. This is what the Tongue hath uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance. His word, mighty is His utterance and exalted His sovereignty:\n\nIn My Name, the Stranger in the world and the Wronged One among the peoples \\[...\\]\n\nO Haydar-'Ali! Make wide the skirt of thy search and spread it out, for the Most Great Ocean hath willed to bestow upon thee from the billows of His bounty the pearls of knowledge and wisdom. Gather them together in His Name and present them unto the peoples of the world, that those endued with vision may thereby be distinguished from others. Thus hath the Most Great Announcement informed thee from this hallowed, glorious and exalted Station. That which befell thee in the path of God hath attained unto the ears of the Lord of Names, and verily He was with thee, He witnessed and beheld, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who aided thee, and happy is he who succored thee, and joy be to him who testified to that which thou didst utter for the sake of God, the Goal of them that know.\n\nIn every age and cycle there hath befallen the loved ones of God that which caused every seeing eye to weep and every person of fairness to lament. The primary cause and origin of tyranny and oppression hath been the ignorant ones of the earth who counted themselves learned and leaders and guides of the servants. They are honored in the name of God, glory be to Him, while they cling to every means toward His abasement. O Haydar! I desire their life, they desire My death. Their heedlessness hath reached such a state that they remain unaware of and veiled from the presence of Him Whom they have worshipped for years, Whose mention they have uttered, and by Whose Name they have been known. By the life of God! They are in manifest error. Their glory hath been removed. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen decreed, before and after, and I am, verily, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nThey have turned aside from the Book of God and have clung to and acted upon the dictates of their desires, even though in every moment a herald from all directions proclaimeth in most eloquent words and announceth of death and evanescence. I swear by the Most Great Ocean that surgeth in this Prison - were they to become aware, even to the extent of a needle's eye, of the recompense of their deeds, they would destroy themselves with their own hands.\n\nSay: Glory be to Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the near ones and the sincere ones have sacrificed their souls to manifest Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy utterance and the pearls of Thy knowledge to ordain from Thy Most Exalted Pen, for him who hath aided Me, that which beseemeth Thy grace and bounty and befitteth Thy generosity and gifts. Thou knowest, O my God, my Goal, my Creator, my Provider, and my Helper, how the oppressors among Thy servants and the rebellious among Thy creatures have risen against me - they who have broken Thy Covenant and Testament, denied Thy Self, and disputed Thy signs. O Lord! Seize them through Thy power, might, strength and sovereignty. Then open before the face of him who aided Thy servant the gate of Thy grace and bounty, and grant him the choice wine of Thy Revelation and the Kawthar of Thy inspiration, that he may be so transported as to see in existence naught save the manifestations of Thy sovereignty and the evidences of Thy grandeur. O Lord! Aid them that have aided Thee, through whom Thou hast raised the standards of Thy unity and elevated the banners of Thy remembrance and praise. Then bring low Thine enemies who have warred against Thy friends throughout the ages and cycles. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.\n\nPraise be to God! Ye are adorned with the lights of the Sun of meanings and are sustained by the fruits of the Tree of grace. I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, that no polytheistic hands shall touch that cherished fruit, and that He will protect it from the tempests of the malevolent ones. Verily, He is powerful over all things. There is no God but Him, the Triumphant, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nFrom the day when the letter of that beloved one reached His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, wondrous and sublime Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the favor of the King of Oneness specifically for each of the friends of the land of M, upon them be the Glory of God. However, due to the upheavals, conflicts, and wars that arose in various regions, there was delay in their dispatch. For long periods, the people of these parts were in utmost fear and disturbance, that what was revealed aforetime from God, our Creator and Fashioner, might be made manifest.\n\nNow for some time the dust of self and passion has settled, and the people of these lands have become tranquil and at rest. Glory be to God! One is astonished to observe that most people cling to that which leads to error and misguidance, while remaining heedless of the Straight Path and the Ark of Salvation, nay, turning away from the Truth, glorified be His majesty. I beseech and implore Him not to deprive His servants of His boundless grace, and to give all to drink from the ocean of awareness. He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, and He is the Powerful.\n\nConcerning what you wrote about his honor Aqa Siyyid Nasru'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of Will specifically for him. His words, exalted be His majesty:\n\nIn My Name, through which the Tree cried out on the Mount \\[...\\]\n\nPraised be He Who hath appeared and revealed the Most Great Ocean, and brought forth from it the pearls of knowledge and wisdom before the faces of all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Among the people are those who have recognized and testified, those who have witnessed yet hesitated, and those who have turned away and denied the bounty of God, the Lord of all worlds. This is the Day wherein the divine bounty hath appeared, the heavenly table hath been sent down, the proof hath been perfected, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath come to pass. By God's life! The earth doth speak, the mountains do pass away, the clouds pour down rain, and the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: \"There is none other God but Me, the Subduer of Names and the All-Powerful over all things. Within My grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on the earth.\"\n\nO Nasrullah! Rejoice that My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee in this Prison, which God hath made the seat of His mighty throne. We have desired the life of the world and the salvation of all therein, yet they have pronounced judgment against My Self without any proof from God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. Blessed is the one with vision who hath beheld the lights of My countenance, the one with hearing who hath heard My call, the strong one who hath taken hold of My Book, and the helper who hath arisen to serve My Cause, the Mighty, the Impregnable.\n\nWe have ordained victory through wisdom and utterance, and through deeds and character from which the near ones perceive the fragrance of My sanctity and My justice, whereby the Path hath been established and the Balance set up. Thus hath the tongue of revelation spoken, yet most of mankind remain heedless. Blessed is he who hath taken the reins of his desires and acknowledged that which his Lord hath testified - he is among those who are brought near in a clear Book.\n\nWhen thou findest the fragrance of My utterance and attainest unto My Book, arise and say: \"Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of Names, and unto Thee be glory, O Thou Who art wronged and estranged!\" Thus have We lit the lamp of prosperity with the fire of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto those who turn away.\n\nGlory be upon thee and upon those who have cast away what the people possess, hoping for that which is with their Lord, the Generous Giver.\n\nAnd this is what hath been sent down to the handmaiden of God from the heaven of the tender mercy of our Lord, the Possessor of sovereignty and the Kingdom. His utterance, exalted be His majesty and glory, is this:\n\nIn the Name of the Peerless Beloved\n\nO handmaiden of God! If thou wert to become all ears, by God's life, it would be befitting, for the Speaker of Sinai hath willed to converse with thee. Be attentive and ponder well, for thou hearest from the Lord of Names the call \"O My handmaiden!\" How many souls in past ages and centuries gave up their lives hoping for this call, yet attained it not. Have those who today have attained unto the Divine Word recognized the station thereof, or are they heedless of it? Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nThat mystery which was hidden in all the divine Books and mentioned in the hearts of the Prophets and holy ones hath become manifest and evident and witnessed. Where are the eyes worthy of this Day, or the ears capable of this call? Ask of God that He may awaken the heedless and the slumbering with this sweet call. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nIf thou hast received thy portion from the fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance, be thou steadfast in His remembrance and act according to that which beseemeth Him. We make mention of thy mother and thy daughter and give them the glad-tidings of God's grace and mercy, that they may rejoice and be among the thankful ones in the Book of God, the Exalted, the Great. Glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of an ancient Commander. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nGod bears witness that His bounty towards that beloved one was manifest to such a degree that had he asked for a hundred or more, these would surely have descended in this blessed night from the heaven of His Will. Exalted be this supreme favor and this bounty which none can reckon save our Lord, the All-Knowing Reckoner. In these days, that beloved one has been mentioned repeatedly and brought to the attention of the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. The Ismu'llah M.H., may the Most Glorious Beauty of God rest upon him, has made mention of that beloved one in several of his writings, and likewise has 'Ali-Qabil-i-Akbar, may the Most Glorious Beauty of God rest upon him, written to this evanescent servant about your service, dedication and what befell you. Similarly from the direction of Kha and the verdant land and elsewhere. God willing, may these loving fragrances ever waft and these breezes of affection continue to blow at all times, delighting the sincere ones. In truth, this is a mention infused with love. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that He will illumine His loved ones with the light of love and unity, nay rather all the peoples of the world. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nLast week, twenty wondrous and exalted Tablets, specifically revealed for the friends in Shahrud, were sent down from the heaven of bounty and forwarded to Aqa Mirza Ahmad, may the Glory of God rest upon him, as per your indication in the letter written to this servant. This servant also wrote and sent two letters to him and to Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah, may the Glory of God rest upon him. God willing, may they be illumined and gladdened by the lights of these revealed Tablets and be sustained by the Kawthar of bounty.\n\nAs for what you mentioned regarding wisdom and expressing concern about its absence, praise be to God, whatever has transpired has caused the exaltation of the Cause, and the Tongue of Grandeur has, in several instances, made mention in the sweetest terms of your honor and what was manifested. That beloved one should thank the Purpose of all the worlds with a hundred thousand tongues, for He has confirmed you in serving His Cause in such wise that most have testified to it. Blessed are you, and would that I were with you!\n\nIf the Tablets for the land of Mim arrive and they turn again towards that land, it would be pleasing, or if they could be entrusted to a reliable friend to deliver to Mulla 'Ali-Jan, may the Glory of God rest upon him, who may then distribute them to their owners as he sees fit. These Tablets of bounty have been ready for some time, but their dispatch was delayed due to the upheavals in various regions. The living have their portion and the dead theirs - for the former, joy and gladness and treasure, and for the latter, mercy and bounty and forgiveness from God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nOnce, as the Ancient Beauty was walking, mention was made of Mulla 'Ali-Jan, may Glory rest upon him, and several others from His blessed tongue, and after a few moments He uttered these exalted words - exalted be His grandeur: \"O servant in attendance! The fragrance of the love of God is inhaled from those regions. Pray for those souls mentioned and for the friends of those parts, and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for success and confirmation. Blessed are they and theirs is a goodly return.\"\n\nYour attention to the regions you mentioned, especially the land of Kaf and Ra, is pleasing, for certain ignorant ones in that land spoke according to their desires and were unaware. Whichever direction they may turn is pleasing, for praise be to God, they are assisted and confirmed and adorned with the ornament of wisdom.\n\nO Muhammad, upon thee be My Glory! Thy mention hath been made at the Most Exalted Horizon; thou hast not been forgotten, nor shalt thou ever be. Wheresoever thou art, He is with thee. We make mention of thy turning unto Us, thy devotion, thy presence, thy steadfastness, and thy service in this glorious and exalted station. It behooveth thee to make mention of My countenance, My acceptance, My favor, the effulgences of the Sun of My grace, the manifestations of My generosity, and the tokens of My mercy and loving-kindness which have preceded all created things.\n\nConcerning the beloved Muhammad Khan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful, you have written that he is among those souls who seem to have come into the world already aflame. Praise be to God, he is illumined by the light of the Divine Countenance and the warmth of love. The verses specifically requested for the aforementioned person have been sent according to the number seven. God willing, may he attain eternal life through the divine fragrances.\n\nAs was previously revealed, \"and from water We made all things living\" - the intended meaning of water in the primal reality was the water of the All-Merciful's utterance. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless.\n\nAsk thou the Self-Sufficing Lord on behalf of the aforementioned person that he may not be deprived of the Water of Life, and that he may not be barred from the outpourings of the True Ever-Flowing Fountain on this wondrous Day. Today, all things hear with attentive ears this blessed word: \"O concourse of men! Seize ye the opportunity in these days of the Dawning-Place of your Lord's command, the All-Merciful. By God! This is a Day the like of which the sun hath never risen upon, by the Life of God!\"\n\nWhat hath flowed from the Pen of Bounty specifically for him in this leaf is, before God, better and more beloved than all his good works, both past and future. I beseech God, thy Lord and the Lord of all that is seen and unseen, to aid him in that which shall cause his mention to endure throughout the eternity of His Most Beautiful Names. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.\n\nIt would be most regrettable if these times, a single moment of which excelleth ages and centuries, should pass fruitlessly and slip away. By the Sun of Justice which shineth from the horizon of this prison due to the oppression of the transgressors, should any soul become aware, even slightly, of the station of these days, or catch a fragrance from the garment of this Revelation, he would turn with heart and soul toward the Most Exalted Horizon and act as befitteth. This is a word that hath descended from the heaven of divine loving-kindness. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless impostor.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nIn My Name, the All-Compassionate, the All-Bountiful\n\nGlory be to Him Who hath appeared and revealed whatsoever He hath willed. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Hashim! Mention of thee was made in the presence of the Wronged One, and there was sent down for thee that which hath caused the dwellers of the graves to arise in these days of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have arisen to serve the Cause and have aided the friends of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and for having sent down for thee that which rejoiceth the hearts of the sincere ones. If thou attainest unto My Book and findest the fragrance of Mine verses, say:\n\nO my God and my Hope! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the mysteries of Thy Book, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy love, turned toward Thy horizon, and speaking Thy praise. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.\n\nIn My Name, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing\n\nSay: Glory be to Thee, O Thou at Whose glances the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee have melted, through the heat of Whose love the hearts of the sincere ones have been set ablaze, by the lights of Whose countenance the hearts of the yearning ones have been attracted, and at the movement of Whose locks the foundations of the lovers have been shaken! I beseech Thee, O Light of hearts and Fire of breasts, by the Crimson Ark and the Word whereby Thou hast subdued earth and heaven, to strengthen me in that which causeth the dwellers of Sinai to inhale the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure and the unitarians to sense the sweet savors of Thy garment. O Lord! Thou seest me detached from the world and turning unto Thee, O Lord of eternity. Wouldst Thou disappoint, O my Beloved, one who awaiteth the wonders of Thy bounty and grace? Wouldst Thou withhold, O my Heart's Desire, one who hath clung to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity and favors? O Lord! I am the weak one who hath sought the stronghold of Thy power, the wronged one who hath hastened to the banner of Thy justice, and the despairing one who hath held fast unto the cord of hope, anticipating the wonders of Thy mercy. O Lord! I am he who was asleep until awakened by the breezes of Thy days, who was seated until raised up by the fragrances of Thy verses, and who was heedless until made aware of the Daysprings of Thy love. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name whereby the world was illumined, to honor me with Thy presence or to ordain for me, from Thy Most Exalted Pen, the reward of one who hath soared in Thy atmosphere by Thy leave and hath drunk the choice wine of Thy reunion through the hands of Thy bounty. O Lord! I beseech Thee to make me, in all conditions, submissive to Thy Command, humble before Thy Judgment, turning toward Thy horizon and speaking Thy praise. O my Beloved and Beloved of the world! I wish to be as a leaf moved by the winds of Thy Will as Thou pleasest. O Lord! This is my soul and my spirit and whatsoever Thou hast given me. I have presented them before Thy face and committed them into Thy hands. Do with them as Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nThe bestowals of grace and stations of bounty are manifest and evident. What more can this helpless writer say or explain? To him who desires to behold the ocean and its waves, say: Behold, it is before thine eyes. In this case, there has never been and is not now any need for an intermediary. His is the command; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\n\nAs to what was written concerning His honor 'Ali-Muhammad, upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke these sublime words, His glory be exalted:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Hearing, the Answering\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and thy Lord calleth thee with the sweetest utterance in the kingdom of divine knowledge. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and thy Lord remembereth thee at this hour with a remembrance that hath perfumed all creation. He is verily the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant. The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison, that thou mayest become aware of thy Lord's grace, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant. The Lord of Names hath turned toward thee. Rejoice and be thou of the thankful.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and the Beloved speaketh before thy face. Thy Lord is verily the All-Hearing, the Answering.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and the Lord remembereth thee from the Most Exalted Summit with a remembrance through which every sincere seeker findeth the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord's mercy, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and the Lord of the world remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison. Give thanks and say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the Messengers.\n\nO 'Ali-Muhammad! Thou art My servant, and thy Lord remindeth thee of the days when thou didst stand before the Gate and didst hear His mighty and wondrous call. O My servant! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that which causeth every tongue to speak, every sorrowful one to rejoice, every stranger to seek the supreme homeland, and every person of understanding to thank his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nWe make mention of Our servant Javad that he may hear what We have caused thee to hear and thank God for this great bounty. O Javad! The Lord of Creation hath turned toward thee from the Prison and remembereth thee with that whereby thy name shall endure in the Book of the world. He Who hath with Him the clear Book beareth witness to this.\n\nO 'Abdu'l-Husayn! Thou art he who attained My remembrance aforetime, and We have sent down for thee that which spoke of My loving-kindness and My mercy that have preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Give thanks unto God for this most great bounty, then remember Him with a goodly remembrance. The glory be upon you and upon the sister and upon your family and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified that there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nIn truth, O beloved of my heart, mention of the loving-kindness of the Beloved of the worlds is beyond pen and tongue. Man is bewildered at the dawning-places of heedlessness, the rising-points of ignorance, and the manifestations of idle fancy. To what do they cling and from what do they turn away in heedlessness? Would that they might become aware of even less than can be numbered of the outpourings of these bountiful days. O Lord! Leave them not to themselves. Assist them through Thy generosity and bounty, then guide them to Thy straight path. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my God! Unveil for them as Thou hast unveiled for us. Thou art verily the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.\n\nNow may His honor 'Ali-Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God, remain smiling and joyous throughout his life at this most exalted remembrance and greatest bounty.\n\nIn the matter of conversations and certain passages, as well as mention of the unity, attraction and steadfastness of the loved ones of God, this brought true joy. If one reflects upon what has transpired and observes with penetrating vision, one's soul will voice praise and thanksgiving, and utter \"blessed be the people of Baha!\" How many souls, with utmost longing and eagerness, advanced toward the place of sacrifice. At one time these exalted words flowed from the tongue of the Lord of Names - glorified be His majesty: \"Were ye to count the martyrs of God, ye could not number them.\" Some were so attracted and enkindled by the Word of God that they sacrificed their lives by their own hands at the threshold of the Beloved of the worlds. Among them was the honored Dhabi? of Baghdad - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - and likewise the one who in the Land of Mystery cut his own throat, and further Jinab-i-Aba-Ba?ir and Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Ashraf - upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God. After beholding the Divine Tablet, they emerged from their homes and openly and clearly proclaimed the Cause of God until they attained the most great martyrdom. And Jinab-i-Najaf-Quli-'Ali - upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy - when they had surrounded him, cried out at the top of his voice saying \"We have found the Pearl and the Price of Blood!\" And in the land of ?a, Jinab-i-Mu??afa - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - and likewise other souls sacrificed their lives with such steadfastness that all were astounded. And Jinab-i-Aba-Badi' - upon him be the Glory of God and His might - who in the land of Kha, when they demanded he deny the Faith and utter but one word, refused and took and drank the cup of supreme martyrdom in the name of the Lord of all beings. Blessed is he! Such events occurred in every land, and these souls willingly gave up their lives in the path of the Peerless Beloved. Should this servant wish to fully recount this station, he would need to occupy himself with writing numerous pages. But time is like the phoenix, and opportunity as rare as the philosopher's stone. In the early days of imprisonment, He commanded that the enkindlement of devoted souls should be somewhat tempered, as it was observed that all desired martyrdom, and numerous petitions had arrived from the friends, all seeking martyrdom from God - exalted be His Glory. After the appearance of these events and these petitions, the Lord of Names uttered these exalted words - mighty be His Glory: \"We command all to wisdom and utterance, and to preserve their lives, a command from Us, and We are the Commanding One, the All-Wise.\" After the martyrdom of Badi', He strictly forbade all from such acts in the Book, and the decree of wisdom descended from the heaven of will in such measure that all are incapable and fall short of reckoning it. Glorified be He Who has appeared and manifested what He willed! However, this Most Great, Most Exalted Cause has not been and is not dependent upon such matters. By the life of God, it is greater than what they have known and understood, were they to perceive it. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be!\n\nAnd regarding the mention that was made of Jinab-i-Ibn-i-Ismu'llah-i-A?daq - upon them both be the most glorious Glory - news of them has arrived in these days from the land of B-SH. Praise be to God, they were in good health, enkindled with the fire of the love of God and speaking His praise, and from that land they intended to travel to other lands. The servant beseeches his Lord to protect him from the oppression of every oppressor and the hatred of every enemy, and to assist him in serving His most mighty, most great, most firm and impregnable Cause.\n\nIn regard to what was written concerning the handmaiden of God, the wife of the late Haji Mirza Hassan, upon them both be the Glory of God, who has sought permission for pilgrimage, this matter was presented before the Divine Presence and was honored with this response, exalted be His grandeur:\n\n\"O Haydar Ali! Upon you be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness. Gladden My handmaiden, upon her be My glory, with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. We have glorified her before and We glorify her at this moment. She heard and responded and turned towards God when all on earth turned away, save whom God wished. Your Lord is the All-Knowing. Give her My glad-tidings and remind her of what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My Will, that she may rejoice in My great bounty.\"\n\nThis year some of the friends, both men and women, have, with permission, turned towards the Praised Spot, but have not yet attained the honor of meeting. They are dwelling and traveling in cities and lands and paths. Should God will it, all shall attain to that which the Divine Purpose hath desired. The Command is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.\n\nO Haydar Ali! Upon you be My glory. The path is long and the hardship great. Beseech God that the Supreme Pen may record for that accepted and successful handmaiden the reward of attainment. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The Glory be upon you and upon her and upon those who love you in this straight Path.\n\nConvey to all the friends in that land the glorification from God and keep them enkindled with the fire of divine love. This day is and hath ever been the Mother of Days. All must hold fast, with perfect wisdom and utterance, to that which will exalt the Cause of the All-Merciful. Thus hath the All-Wise ordained in the Scriptures and Tablets.\n\nRegarding the mention made of Jinab-i-Abu'l-Hassan and Jinab-i-Aqa Ali and Aqa Ahmad from Qa'in, upon them be the Glory of God, praise be to God that these mentioned names have attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Abu'l-Hassan, blessed and exalted be His words:\n\nIn My Name which shineth forth from the horizon of justice!\n\nO Abu'l-Hassan! The Lord of the hidden and the manifest remembereth thee and commandeth thee to that which will profit thee in all the worlds of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Hold fast unto goodly deeds and unto that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Rejoice in My remembrance of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Rememberer, the Mighty, the Great. The letter of one who loveth Me came before My face, and therein was thy mention. We have remembered thee with that which causeth the breeze of loving-kindness to waft over all created things. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bestower, the Generous. We make mention of Our loved ones in Qaf and Alif and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance of them and My turning towards them from this distant Prison. They have borne in the path of God that which none bore before them. To this doth testify the Pen of God, the Most High, in this perspicuous Tablet. God shall soon reward those who were patient in His days and shall make manifest their stations in such wise that the tongues of the world shall speak forth: \"Blessed be God, the Most Generous of the generous ones!\"\n\nWe make mention of thy father, who was named Ahmad, and bid him to observe that which hath been revealed in the Book and to manifest beauteous patience. O Ahmad! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. He remembereth thee and informeth thee of that which hath come to pass in the Prison Land by the command of the Mighty, the Powerful. He who circled round the Throne of the Lord of Names hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion. Thus hath appeared the decree of destiny from the One Who ordaineth from ancient times. We have revealed for him that which shall endure throughout the eternity of My Most Beautiful Names. Thus doth the perspicuous Book apprise thee from His presence. O Ahmad! By the life of God, all the treasures of the world cannot equal a single letter of that which hath been revealed for him. To this beareth witness the Ancient of Days from this exalted station. We console thee and those who are related unto him by God's decree, as a mercy from Our presence, for verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory of God rest upon him and upon thee and upon thy son, from God, the Mighty, the Most Praised.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor 'Ali from the horizon of the Prison in My Name, the Manifest:\n\nO 'Ali! The True One, exalted be His glory, hath ever fixed His gaze of loving-kindness upon His loved ones on earth. For each one hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will that which no treasures, mines, traces or fruits can equal. We beseech the True One to aid all to preserve this most exalted station and supreme gift. Praise be to God! The rain of grace hath poured upon the people of Qaf and Alif. Its effects shall surely become manifest. Blessed are they who have quaffed the sealed wine and are steadfast in the Cause of God. They are My loved ones on earth and My chosen ones in the lands. Upon them be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which hath preceded existence. We console all who have believed in God in thy land, for surely the believers and the sincere in that land have been touched by grief in this new calamity. Now must they, through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, drink from the chalice of joy. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of unity, a station hath been conferred upon him which, were less than a needle's eye thereof to be unveiled, all would be struck unconscious with joy. Exalted is this most great favor, and exalted is that noble station! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Ahmad, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the Most Holy, the Most Impregnable, the Most Exalted\n\nA mention from Our presence unto him who hath attained unto the recognition of My days, when the divines and doctors of the earth turned away from Me, save those who quaffed the choice wine of the Bayan from the hand of My bounty. And I am the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O Ahmad! We have heard thy mention and have turned toward thee from this spot which God hath made the Dawning-Place of His mighty signs and the Source of His commandments and ordinances. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Lord of all return, Who hath graciously aided thee and guided thee unto the straight path. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that neither the conditions of men shall cause thee to slip nor the veils of idle fancies prevent thee.\n\nWe love to make mention in every Tablet of him who was named Nabil-i-'Ali, who cast away the world in his longing to attain the presence of the Ancient of Days and who clung in all conditions to the hem of the robe of his Lord, the Revealer of verses. He hath ascended in spirit and fragrance, and there hath been revealed for him that whereby the Concourse on High perceived the sweet savors of the garment of mercy of their Lord, the Lord of all mankind. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace and the light gleaming from the direction of My mercy be upon him and upon thee and upon every patient believer.\n\nVerily, all the devoted ones, the unitarians and the sincere ones throughout all lands should be offered condolences, for a mighty pillar hath vanished from sight. However, such grace hath been vouchsafed unto them that this servant can testify that an atom thereof is sweeter, more pleasing, more excellent and more precious than the life of the world. In truth, this evanescent one hath repeatedly uttered \"Would that I had been with him!\" beseeching and supplicating God, exalted be His glory, that He may confirm all and deprive none from the ocean of His good-pleasure. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nAs for the sublime Tablets which were requested for some who dwell in various regions, these shall be sent, God willing. However, had ye given precedence to the people of M, it would have appeared closer to piety, for the newly-planted, wondrous saplings are and have been awaiting water. The attention of the beloved one, His Holiness the Name of God M, may the most glorious of all glory rest upon him, to those regions is most beloved and acceptable before the Throne. God willing, may all who are on earth not be deprived of this all-embracing, pre-existing mercy. From these servants: supplication and humility; and from God, exalted be His glory: acceptance and bestowal. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nThese are days wherein the Most Great Word, like a true magnet, will reveal all that is hidden in the realities of men and concealed in their hearts. How many possessors of asceticism, piety and fear of God who, on the Day of Resurrection, manifested naught but vain desire. This is the Day whereon the secrets are tried and that which is in the hearts is uncovered. Reflect upon His Holiness Sh.J., may the glory of God rest upon him, how the divine Word revealed, like the rays of the sun without veil or covering, the victory that was hidden within him and concealed from him and all eyes. Blessed is He Who attracted whom He willed through His Most Exalted Word.\n\nNow their station is ordained with God and their mention is recorded with the Truth, to such extent that it hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen in these pages that their intention was beloved, their deed acceptable, and their triumph welcome. Assuredly the effulgences of the sun of divine favor will become manifest and evident to all the worlds. How many souls who claimed knowledge were accounted among the most ignorant before God. Well is it with him who hath quaffed the sealed wine and aided the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nOf the sent pieces, one should reach the son of his honor Aqa Mirza Husayn, may the glory of God rest upon him. The Most Great Branch, may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps, hath specifically bestowed it upon him, and his name is inscribed on the back of that same piece. May the glory that shineth from the horizon of the favor of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal, be upon you and upon those who have turned with radiant faces unto God in this wondrous Day. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.\n\n=== END BH00065 ===\n\n=== START BH00066 ===\n\nIn My Name, the Grief-Stricken\n\nO Salman! From the City of the Soul, waft thou the holy breaths of the All-Merciful over the peoples of all the worlds and contingent beings. With the foot of steadfastness, the wings of detachment, and a heart aflame with the fire of the love of God, press thou forward that the cold of winter may not affect thee, nor prevent thee from journeying through the valley of oneness. O Salman! These days are the manifestation of the firm, established word \"There is no God but Him,\" for the letter of negation hath preceded and taken precedence over the name of affirmation in relation to the essence of affirmation and its manifestation. None among the people of creation hath thus far perceived this divine subtlety, and what they have witnessed - that the letters of negation have ever outwardly prevailed over the letters of affirmation - hath been due to the influence of this Word, whose Revealer, in view of the hidden wisdoms contained within this all-embracing Word, hath given precedence to negation. Were I to make mention of its veiled and concealed wisdoms, thou wouldst assuredly find the people thunderstruck, nay rather, lifeless.\n\nWhatsoever thou beholdest in the earth, even if it appeareth to contravene the outward desire of the Embodiments of His Cause, yet in truth all hath been and shall ever be according to the Divine Will. Should anyone, after perceiving this Tablet, reflect upon the aforementioned Word, he would become aware of a wisdom heretofore unknown, for the form of words is the treasury of truth, and their inherent meanings are the spiritual pearls of the Sovereign of Oneness. The hand of Divine infallibility forbiddeth the people from attaining unto it, but when God's Will so decrees and the hand of power unsealeth it, then do the people become cognizant thereof.\n\nConsider, for instance, the words of the Furqan, which contained all the divine treasures of the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory and majesty. All the divines would recite them night and day and write commentaries thereon, yet were they powerless to reveal a single letter of the hidden pearls stored within these verbal treasuries. And when the promised hour came, the hand of power of Him Whom I manifest moved the seal of its treasuries according to the capacity and receptivity of the people. Thus did children of the age who had not understood a single letter of outward knowledge become aware, according to their measure, of the hidden mysteries, to such an extent that a mere child could confound the divines of the age in exposition. Such is the power of the Divine Hand and the all-encompassing nature of the Will of the Sovereign of Oneness.\n\nShould anyone reflect upon these words that have been mentioned, he would observe that not a single atom moveth except by His Will, nor doth anyone become cognizant of a single letter save through His Purpose - exalted be His station, and exalted be His power, and exalted be His sovereignty, and exalted be His grandeur, and exalted be His command, and exalted be His grace above all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Salman! The Pen of the All-Merciful declares: In this Dispensation, I have removed the word of negation from the beginning of affirmation, and its decree, God willing, shall descend from the heaven of divine will, and We shall send it thereafter. O Salman! Sorrows have so encompassed Me that the tongue of the All-Merciful has been prevented from making mention of exalted matters. I swear by the Lord of all possibility that the gates of the paradise of inner meanings have been shut due to the oppression of the idolaters, and the breezes of divine knowledge have been cut off from the right hand of divine unity. O Salman! Think not that My tribulations are confined to these days, though they have outwardly existed before and after. One whom I nurtured by the hand of mercy through months and years rose up to slay Me. Were I to make mention of the mysteries of the past, thou wouldst learn that from time immemorial certain among the servants who were created by the Word of Command have risen in opposition to the Truth and violated the wonders of His Cause. Consider Harut and Marut, who were two servants brought nigh unto God. Through their extreme sanctity they became known as angels. They were brought from nothingness into being by the all-encompassing Will, and their mention was recorded in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and their signs were made manifest. They were so close to God that the tongue of grandeur spoke their praise, until they reached a station where they regarded themselves as more pious, more exalted, and more detached than all other servants. Then a breeze blew from the direction of divine testing, and they were cast down to the nethermost fire. Most of what is mentioned among people concerning these two angels is false and far from the shore of truth. With Us is the knowledge of all things preserved in tablets of glory. Yet none among the peoples of that age objected to the Truth, exalted be His grandeur, asking why, after these two angels had attained such stations of sanctity and nearness, He took this station from them. O Salman! Say to the people of the Bayan: Transform not the everlasting divine elixir and the eternal heavenly Kawthar into bitter water, and efface not the melody of the Nightingale of eternity from your hearing. Walk beneath the shade of the outspread cloud of mercy and dwell in the shadow of the Tree of grace. O Salman! The Truth has ever judged among men according to outward appearances, and all the Prophets and Messengers were commanded to judge among creatures according to the outer appearance, and no other way is permitted. For example, observe that a person may now be a believer and a monotheist, upon whom the Sun of divine unity has shed its radiance to such an extent that he acknowledges and confesses all the divine names and attributes, and bears witness to that which the Ancient Beauty has testified unto Himself by Himself. In this station, all attributes apply to and are true of him. Indeed, none but God is capable of describing him as he truly is, and all these attributes refer to that divine effulgence that has shone upon him from the Sovereign Who manifests it. In this station, should anyone turn away from him, he has turned away from the Truth, for naught can be seen in him save divine effulgences. As long as he remains in this station, should any word other than good be spoken concerning him, the speaker has been and will ever be a liar. But after the withdrawal of that effulgence by which he was characterized \\[...\\]\n\nAnd after the turning away of that Manifestation Who was the bearer of these attributes, and all these attributes returned with Him to His dwelling place, that soul is no longer the same soul that it was before, such that those attributes should remain with it. And if one were to observe with penetrating vision, even the garment that soul is wearing is not and never will be the same as before. For when a believer, at the time of his faith in God and recognition of Him, even if his garment be of coarse cotton, it is accounted as silk of Paradise in the sight of God. And after turning away, it becomes as pitch of hellfire. In such case, should anyone describe such a soul with those attributes, he would be a liar and be reckoned with the people of fire in the sight of God. O Salman! I have deposited the proofs of this utterance in all things, by themselves and of themselves. Nevertheless, it is most strange that people have not perceived this and have stumbled at the appearance of such matters. Consider the lamp: so long as it is bright, luminous and aflame, should anyone deny its light, he would surely be a liar. However, after a breeze extinguishes it, should one say it is still shining, he was and ever will be a liar - even though the niche and candle are one and the same both when giving light and when not. O Salman! Today behold all things as mirrors, for all creation was brought into being by a single word and standeth in one plane before God. And should all turn to this eternal Sun which hath shone forth from the most holy horizon of glory, in all would be reflected the image of the Sun in its form. In such case, all the names and attributes of the Sun would be true of those mirrors, for naught would be seen in them save the Sun and its radiance. And to the perceiving sage it is evident that these attributes belong not to the mirrors in and of themselves, but rather all attributes pertain to that reflection which hath appeared and shone forth in those mirrors from the dawning-place of the Sun's grace. And so long as this reflection endureth, the attributes endure, and after the effacement of that reflection from the forms of the mirrors, the description of those mirrors by any who would describe them would be and ever will be pure falsehood and absolute untruth, for names and attributes circle round the reflection which hath shone forth from the Sun, not round the mirrors in and of themselves. O Salman! The glory of all names, their exaltation, their greatness and their fame, hath been through their relation unto God. For instance, observe the temples that have been raised among different peoples - all circle round these temples and journey from distant places to visit them. And it is evident that the reverence for these temples hath been because the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, hath related them unto Himself, even though all know that the Ancient Beauty hath never needed and will never need any house, and the relation of all places to His holy Being hath been equal. Rather, He hath made these temples and their like the cause of the attainment and success of His servants, that He might not deprive all people of the wonders of His grace. Blessed, then, is he who followeth the Command of God.\n\nObserve these Houses in the sight of God - they remain exalted so long as their connection \\[to God\\] is not severed. But after this connection is cut off, should anyone circumambulate them, they circumambulate only their own selves and are counted among the denizens of fire in God's sight. Similarly, observe the Houses of individual souls - after they turn away, the decree of idol applies to them, and those who cling to them are and shall be counted as idol-worshippers before God. Consider now how these Houses, both during their connection to God and after that connection is severed, maintain the same form and appearance. Indeed, no change is visible in their outer form, whether during their connection or without it. However, when the connection is cut off, the hidden spirit dwelling within those Houses is withdrawn, and none perceive this save those endowed with true knowledge. Observe this same truth in all the Manifestations of Names, who are the Houses of souls.\n\nO Salman! Observe the words of the All-Merciful with a pure heart and sanctified vision, and reflect, that perchance thou mayest attain to God's purpose. O Salman! At the time of departure from Iraq, the Tongue of God informed all that the Samiri would appear and the Calf would raise its call, and that after the setting of the Sun, the birds of night would surely take flight. Those two have appeared, but soon the birds of night will arise claiming Lordship and Divinity. We beseech God to make people know their own selves, lest they transgress their bounds and station, and that they may remember God with this Most Great Remembrance, and aid His Cause with all their limbs and members, and be as standards between the heavens and the earth.\n\nO people! Dwell beneath God's shade, then remain in your seats with God's tranquility and great dignity. Hold fast to the cord of servitude unto God, the True One. This is a station that nothing in the heavens and earth can equal, and through it God's Cause is made manifest among His servants and creatures. Whoso holds fast to it in these days hath truly aided God's Cause, and whoso turns away from it hath shown pride before God - and none show pride save every transgressing sinner. God willing, may all dwell and find rest beneath the Beauty of the Ancient One, and be turned toward His direction, for this is indeed a great bounty.\n\nAs for thy question about the meaning of the verse - although the Pen of Command hath not been inclined to expound upon poetic meanings, since today the oceans of inner meanings have appeared in their essence and origin, and there is no need for previous utterances; rather, all possessors of knowledge, wisdom and understanding, both past and future, have been and will be in need of these surging and wondrous oceans - yet in response to thy request, a brief explanation shall be given, flowing from the Pen of the Ancient of Days according to God's will. The question is:\n\n\"When colorlessness became the prisoner of color,\n\nA Moses came into conflict with a Moses.\"\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nO Salman! The mystics have many such statements on these matters. Some have supposed Truth to be the sea and creation to be the waves, saying that the differences in the waves are due to forms, and forms are contingent, and after casting off forms all return to the sea - meaning they are in reality the sea - and concerning forms they have made other statements which it is not permissible to mention here. Similarly, they have described Truth as ink and all other things as letters, saying it is that same reality of ink appearing in different forms of letters, these forms being in reality one ink. They have called the first the station of unity and the second the station of multiplicity. Likewise they have spoken of Truth as the One and all things as numbers, and Truth as water and all things as ice, as they have said:\n\n\"Creation in similitude is but as ice,\n\nAnd Thou art as the water whence it springs;\n\nThe ice doth melt, its ruling pass away,\n\nThe water's rule prevails - such is the truth.\"\n\nAnd in another place they have said:\n\n\"The sea remains the sea as in eternity;\n\nAll that occurs are waves and phantoms merely.\"\n\nKnow that they consider all things to be manifestations of the essential theophany of Truth, and have mentioned three types of theophany - essential, attributive, and active. They regard the subsistence of all things through Truth as manifestational subsistence. Were all these matters to be fully expounded, it would so weary the hearers that they would be deprived of recognizing the essence of knowledge. Similarly, they believe in the existence of archetypal realities within the Divine Essence, as one mystic philosopher has said: \"The realities of things exist within His exalted Essence in their most noble form, then He causes them to emanate,\" for they do not consider the Giver of a thing to be devoid of that thing, declaring this impossible. Thus Ibn 'Arabi has written an extensive treatise on this subject, and mystical philosophers and later ones like ?adr Shirazi, Fay? and their like have walked in the shallow waters of Ibn 'Arabi's stream. Blessed is he who walks upon the red sand on the shore of this sea, by whose waves forms and semblances are effaced from what the people have imagined. How excellent is he who has stripped himself of all indications and allusions, who swims in this sea and its depths, and attains to the whales of inner meanings and the pearls of wisdom created therein. Joy to those who attain!\n\nEvery soul who has believed in the utterances of the mystics and followed that path has considered both Moses and Pharaoh to be manifestations of Truth - the former being the manifestation of the names \"Guide\" and \"Mighty\" and their like, and the latter being the manifestation of the names \"Misleader\" and \"Abaser\" and their like. Hence they affirm the reality of conflict between these two, yet after stripping away human limitations, they consider both to be one, just as they consider all things to be fundamentally one, as was briefly mentioned before. These are the beliefs of the people, some of which have been briefly stated. But O Salman! The Pen of the All-Merciful declares: Today, both the affirmer and denier of these utterances stand at the same level, for the Sun of Truth is shining by Its own Self and is manifest from the horizon of the eternal heaven. Whosoever occupies himself with mentioning these utterances will assuredly remain deprived of recognizing the Beauty of the All-Merciful. The springtime of philosophical speculation belongs to the time of absence, but today is the springtime of mystic revelation and meeting. Say: O people! Graze in these days in the meadows of revelation and witnessing, then abandon vain imaginings. Thus does the Pen of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, command you.\n\nThe mention of all knowledge has been for the recognition of the Known, and the exposition of proofs has been exclusively for establishing that which is indicated. Now praise be to God that the Sun of the Known has dawned from the horizon of the heaven of the Self-Subsisting, and the Moon of that which is indicated has appeared and shone forth in the heaven of Command. Sanctify thy heart from all allusions, and behold with thine outward eye the Sun of meanings in the holy spiritual heaven, and observe Its Names' and Attributes' effulgences in all things, that thou mayest attain unto all knowledge and its source, origin and mine. O Salman! By the Ancient Beauty, in these days new knowledge is being sent down every moment from the heaven of the recognition of the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this Spring and hath detached himself from all else. O people of attraction and longing! Judge fairly: concerning these utterances which have been briefly mentioned from the words of the mystics, there exist countless books among men today. Were a person to desire to comprehend them all, two lifetimes would not suffice. O Salman! Say: God is manifest above all things, and the Kingdom on that Day shall be God's; then leave the people to what they possess. Set aside the knowledge of the past. Moses, who was among the most great Prophets, after thirty days - during which, according to the mystics, in the first ten days he annihilated his deeds in the deeds of Truth, in the second ten his attributes in the attributes of Truth, and in the third ten his essence in the essence of Truth - and they have said that since there remained in him a vestige of existence, therefore did he hear the words \"Thou shalt not behold Me.\" But now the Tongue of God speaks and declares: \"Say 'Show me' once, and attain unto the presence of the Lord of Majesty a hundred thousand times!\" Where is the grace of these days compared with former days! O Salman! All that the mystics have mentioned has been and shall be within the realm of creation, for exalted souls and detached hearts, no matter how high they soar in the heaven of knowledge and wisdom, cannot transgress the limits of their own contingent beings and that which was created within themselves by themselves. All the knowledge of every knower, all the remembrance of every rememberer, and all the description of every describer terminates in that which was created within him through the revelation of his Lord. Should any soul reflect even briefly, he would himself testify that it is impossible for creation to transgress its own limitations, and all examples and knowledge from the beginning that has no beginning revert to His creation, which was created through the Contingent Will, by itself and for itself from no thing. Glorified be God from being known through anyone's knowledge, or that any similitudes should revert to Him! There exists between Him and His creation no connection, no link, no direction, no allusion and no sign. He created all contingent things through His Will which hath encompassed the worlds. The Truth has ever been, in the sublimity of His sovereign unity, sanctified above the knowledge of all created things, and will forever remain, in the exaltation of His mighty transcendence, hallowed beyond the comprehension of all existing things. All who are in earth and heaven were created by His Word and have come from utter nothingness into the realm of being. How then can a created thing which was brought into being by the Word ascend unto the Ancient Being? O Salman! The way of all to the Ancient Being hath ever been barred.\n\nAnd since they have come from utter nothingness into the realm of being, how can a creature created by the Word ascend unto the Ancient Being? O Salman, the path of all to the Ancient Being hath ever been and shall ever remain barred, and out of pure bounty and grace hath He caused the Suns dawning from the horizon of oneness to appear amidst men, and hath ordained that the recognition of these holy Beings should be as the recognition of His own Self. Whoso hath known them hath known God, and whoso hath hearkened unto their words hath hearkened unto the words of God, and whoso hath acknowledged them hath acknowledged God, and whoso hath turned away from them hath turned away from God, and whoso hath disbelieved in them hath disbelieved in God. They are the Path of God between the heavens and the earth, and the Balance of God in the kingdom of Command and creation, and they are the Manifestation of God and His proofs amongst His servants and His evidences amidst His creatures. O Salman, detach thyself from all that is renowned amongst men, and with the wings of detachment soar unto the heaven of most glorious holiness. By God! If thou shouldst fly unto it and reach its inmost essence, thou wouldst behold in existence naught save the countenance of the Well-Beloved, and wouldst see the deniers as though they had never been mentioned. The mention of this station requireth another tongue to recount it and another ear to hear it.\n\nO Salman! How much sweeter it is that we should consign the mysteries of the soul and the wonders of the Beloved's praise to the heaven of the All-Merciful's will, and begin to expound the meaning of this verse. Know thou that the author of the Mathnavi, in mentioning Moses and Pharaoh, was speaking metaphorically, not suggesting that these two were one in essence - God forbid! For Pharaoh and his like were created by the Word of Moses, could ye but understand. And the very outward conflict that existed between them proves that they were opposed to each other in all worlds. This is a subtle truth that none can grasp save every discerning mystic.\n\nThe author of the Mathnavi regarded all beings in the kingdom of names as Moses, inasmuch as all were created from dust and unto dust shall return. Likewise are all marked by letters. In the world of spirits, which is the realm of oneness, there never was and never shall be conflict and contention, for the causes of strife are not evident there. However, after spirits enter bodies and appear in this world, the causes of discord arise, whether of truth or falsehood. Such strife and contention, if occurring to establish the Cause of the All-Glorious, has been and ever shall be truth; otherwise it is falsehood. All this strife and contention, love and hatred, acceptance and rejection revolve around causes.\n\nFor instance, observe how one effect proceeds from a cause. This cause is single, yet in each soul it is transformed according to that soul's capacity and its effects become manifest. In each station it appears with a different manifestation. Consider, for example, the divine name \"the Enricher.\" This name in its own kingdom is one, but after it is reflected in the mirrors of human existence, its effects appear in each soul according to that soul's capacity. Thus in the generous it manifests as generosity, in the miserly as miserliness, in the wretched as wretchedness, and in the fortunate as good fortune. For in a state of poverty, souls and what lies within them remain concealed. For instance, when someone possesses not a penny, both their generosity and miserliness remain hidden. Likewise, their fortune or misfortune is not apparent at this stage.\n\nBut after attaining wealth, whatever lies within each soul becomes evident and manifest. Thus one person spends whatever they possess in the path of God, another arranges the means of warfare and rises to oppose and dispute with truth, while yet another hoards everything such that both they themselves and others are deprived of their wealth. Observe now how from a single manifestation what diverse and different effects appear! Yet before this manifestation, all these souls were dormant, concealed and frozen in their places. How the manifestation of the sun of the name \"the Enricher\" resurrected these souls and made manifest what was hidden within! If thou wouldst observe this exposition with the eye of insight, thou wouldst become aware of the concealed mysteries. Consider the Pharaoh of the age - if wealth \\[...\\]\n\nAnd if thou wilt observe this utterance with the eye of insight, thou wilt become aware of hidden mysteries. Consider the Pharaoh of the age - had it not been for his outward wealth and power, he would never have risen to oppose the Beauty of the Most High, for in the absence of means he was and would be powerless, with unbelief concealed within him. Blessed, therefore, are those souls who have not been captivated by the coloring of the world and all that hath been created therein, but have attained unto the coloring of God - that is, have taken on the color of truth in this wondrous Revelation, which is sanctification from all the varied colors of the world. None but the detached can recognize this coloring. Even as today, the people of Baha who are embarked upon the Ark of eternity and are sailing upon the Mighty Sea recognize one another, while none besides these companions are aware, and even if they should become aware, it would be only to the extent that the blind perceive the sun. O Salman! Say to the servants: Enter ye upon the shore of the Ancient Sea, that ye may be sanctified from all colors and may attain unto the most holy and pure station and the most great prospect. O Salman! All the varied colors of the world have prevented the servants from reaching the shore of the Most Glorious Holiness. Consider, for instance, that well-known person who rose in opposition. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that he would circle round Me night and day, and in the early hours while I was resting he would stand by My head as verses of God were being revealed unto him, serving throughout the night and day. Yet when the Cause was raised up and he observed that his name had become renowned, the color of name and love of leadership so seized him that he remained deprived of the holy shore of oneness. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, in all creation none hath been seen to match him in his love of position and rank. By Him Who hath caused all things to speak forth His praise, should all the people of creation attempt to enumerate the jealousy and hatred of his soul, they would all find themselves powerless to do so. We beseech God to purify his heart and cause him to return unto His Self and to strengthen him in acknowledging God, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Great.\n\nO Salman! Consider the Cause of God: a single word issues forth from the tongue of the Manifestation of Divine Unity - that word in itself is one and has appeared from a single source. Yet after the Sun of the Word dawns from the horizon of the mouth of God upon His servants, it appears in each soul according to its own condition. Thus in one it produces rejection, in another acceptance; similarly love and hatred and the like. Then these lovers and haters rise up in conflict and opposition, each having taken on a color, whereas before the appearance of the Word they had been friends and united. After the dawning of the Sun of the Word, the one who accepts is adorned with the color of God, while the one who rejects takes on the color of self and desire. The radiance of this same divine Word appears in the accepting soul with the color of acceptance, and in the rejecting soul with the color of rejection, even though the original radiance was sanctified above all colors. Consider the sun - with a single effulgence it shines upon mirrors and crystal glasses, yet in each glass it appears according to its color, as you have all observed and witnessed. In brief, the cause of conflict between the rejecter and accepter has become color and hue. Yet between these two colors there is an infinite difference - one appears with God's coloring and the other with the coloring of desire. The color of the believing accepter who strives is the color of the All-Merciful, while the color of the rejecting hypocrite is Satan's color. That color is the cause and means of purifying souls from the coloring of all else save God, while this is the cause of staining souls with the various colors of self and passion. That bestows eternal life, while this eternal death. That guides the detached ones to the Kawthar of immortality, while this makes the veiled ones taste the infernal tree. From that wafts the fragrance of the All-Merciful, from this the stenches of Satan. The author of the Mathnavi did not mean by these words that Moses and Pharaoh were of the same rank - God forbid! - as some ignorant ones have understood. Moses' deed bears truthful witness to his religion, for his struggle was for God's sake, aiming to deliver Pharaoh from ephemeral colors and bring him to God's color, while he himself tasted the cup of martyrdom in the path of the Friend. But Pharaoh's struggle was to preserve his own life and kingdom. Moses' purpose was to kindle God's lamp amidst all else, while Pharaoh's purpose was to extinguish it. Is one who spends his spirit in God's path like one who hides behind seventy thousand veils? What ails these people that they can barely comprehend a clear statement from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? Rather, the Mathnavi's author meant that color became the cause of conflict between Moses and Pharaoh - but Moses' color was one for which the denizens of the highest paradise would sacrifice themselves, while Pharaoh's was a color from which even the people of the lowest hell would recoil. The Mathnavi's author himself has mentioned Pharaoh in numerous places - if you consider, you will understand that his intent was not what some attribute to him. And how earnestly he expressed his longing to associate with the loved ones of God and attain to serving the friends of Truth! Thus in one place he states \\[...\\]\n\nWithout the favors of God and His chosen ones, though one be a king, his pages are but blackened. O Salman! Impress upon the loved ones of God that they should not view anyone's words with the eye of objection, but rather observe with an eye of mercy and compassion - except for those souls who in this day write inflammatory tablets in rejection of God. It is incumbent upon all souls to write whatever they are capable of to refute those who have rejected God. Thus has it been ordained by the Ancient and Powerful One. For in this day the triumph of Truth is achieved through mention and utterance, not by sword or the like. Thus did We send down aforetime, and now, if ye but knew. By Him Who speaks now in all things that there is no God but Him! If anyone writes even a single word in refutation of those who have rejected God, such a station shall be bestowed upon them that all the denizens of the highest Paradise would envy that station, and all the pens of creation would be powerless to describe it, and all tongues of beings fall short of its depiction. For whosoever in this day stands firm in this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Impregnable Cause stands against all who are in the heavens and earth. And God is sufficient witness to this, and is All-Knowing.\n\nO loved ones of God! Rest not upon the couch of ease, and when ye have recognized your Creator and heard what hath befallen Him, arise to His aid, then speak and be not silent for less than a moment. This is better for you than all the treasures that have been and shall be, were ye of them that understand. Such is the counsel of the Most Exalted Pen unto the servants of God.\n\nO Salman! Know thou that never hath any soul possessed of even a modicum of understanding maintained that they who turn towards God and they who turn away from Him, the monotheist and the polytheist, occupy the same station and rank. And as to what thou hast heard or read in some of the former books, that the names are one in the presence of God - this referreth to the sacred court of the Truth. And concerning what was mentioned that names are one in the Kingdom of Names - deem not the Kingdom to be imaginary. The Kingdom, the Dominion, and the Realm of Divine Unity are this day circling round the Throne, and from the effulgence of these stations and worlds which are visible in this place, the worlds of the Realm of Divine Unity, the Dominion, and the Kingdom, and what lieth beyond them, exist and are established in their proper places. The detailed exposition of these stations is not permitted at this time and remaineth suspended in the heaven of Divine Will until God shall cause it to descend through His grace. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nIn brief, in the presence of God all names have been and shall ever be one, and this is prior to the utterance of the Decisive Word. For instance, observe how today all the manifestations of names in their own kingdom are visible before God, and likewise the dawning-places of attributes and all that hath been. And by virtue of the establishment of the Ancient Beauty upon the throne of justice, His favor hath encompassed all equally. However, after the pronouncement of the Word, distinction and differentiation become manifest among the servants, such that whosoever is enabled to say \"yea\" attaineth unto all good. I swear by the sorrow of the Beauty of the All-Glorious that such a station hath been ordained for him who accepteth that if less than a needle's eye thereof were to be revealed unto the dwellers of the earth, they would all perish from rapture. For this reason, in this outward life the stations of the believers have been concealed from the believers themselves, and whosoever is not assured in affirming \"yea\" is unmentioned with God. We take refuge with God from the punishment ordained for such a one, for which there is no equal.\n\nO Salman! Convey the words of the All-Merciful unto the servants and say: Guard yourselves from the wolves of the earth and give no ear to the vain utterances that some speak. Purify your hearing for the hearkening unto My words, and sanctify your hearts for the recognition of My Beauty from all that hath been created.\n\nO Salman! Proclaim: How many are the dawns when the beauty of the All-Glorious hath passed over your hearts and found you occupied with others, and returned to His place of rest. O Salman! Say: O servants! Walk in the footsteps of truth and ponder upon the deeds of the Manifestation of Ancient Days, and reflect upon His words, that perchance ye may attain unto the living waters of the eternal Kawthar of the All-Glorious. If the faithful and the unfaithful were to occupy the same station, and divine worlds were limited to this earthly realm, My previous Manifestation would never have delivered Himself into the hands of His enemies and sacrificed His life. I swear by the Daystar of this Cause that were people to become aware of but a drop of the yearning and longing of the Beauty of the All-Glorious at the moment when that divine Temple was suspended in the air, they would all, in their eagerness, lay down their lives in the path of this holy divine Manifestation. Yet sugar is given to parrots while dung is for beetles; the nightingale hath no portion of melody, and the bat fleeth the rays of the sun.\n\nO Salman! My tribulations among nations and governments are a mighty proof and a powerful testimony. For twenty years I drank not a drop of water in peace, nor did I rest for a single night - at times in chains and fetters, at times captive and imprisoned. Had We been looking to this world and all that is therein, We would never have subjected Ourselves to such afflictions. Blessed is the soul that partaketh of the fruits of this station and tasteth of its sweetness. Ask ye of God for vision and seek ye a sound palate, for to the sightless the image of Joseph and the wolf appear the same, and to the sick palate colocynth and sugar seem alike. Yet I cherish the hope that through the holy fragrances of these days souls will appear who would not purchase the world and all that is therein for a penny, who would gaze toward God detached from all else, who would consider laying down their lives in the path of the All-Merciful as the easiest of all things, who would not falter on the straight path due to the opposition of the opposers, and who would take up their dwelling in the shelter of the Friend. How blessed are they! How glad tidings unto them! How glorious are they! How noble are they! By God! The maidens of the Most Exalted Paradise are restless in their longing to meet these souls, and the denizens of the Eternal Realm find no peace in their yearning. Thus hath God chosen these ones for Himself and made them detached from all the worlds.\n\nO Salman! The sorrows that have befallen Us have prevented the Pen of the All-Merciful from mention of the stations of divine unity. Affliction hath reached such a degree that even were all who dwell on earth to be seated at the banquet table of His bounty, and were they to feast endlessly upon all that existeth, none could ever accuse Him of miserliness. Yet they have written abroad claiming that We have cut off their stipends. Observe what baseness and meanness of character, that for the sake of acquiring the baubles of men and slandering the Ancient Beauty, they have dispatched such calumnies to all regions. This, when thou wert present here and didst witness that this servant never laid eyes on the stipends of these people, and whatever existed was distributed externally and given to each soul. Nevertheless, merely to undermine the Cause of God and to acquire a few dinars, they have acted in such manner as thou hast heard. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that the first affliction that befell this servant was accepting stipends from the government, and were it not for these souls, I surely would not have accepted it. Thou art well aware how difficult the matter hath become for the emigrants, yet we are all thankful and patient and content with God's decree. Nothing shall befall us except what God hath ordained for us; in Him do we place our trust in all matters. As for these people who complain about stipends to all regions and beg, they claim lordship while turning away from the Truth. Consider then the state of those souls who follow such a group. Shame upon them and upon those who follow them! Soon shall the angels of divine wrath seize them from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. They shall find for themselves neither helper nor sustainer. Thus hath it been sent down in truth from the heaven of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Beloved. And the glory be upon thee, O Salman, and upon those who have not sold the words of God for rejected delusions.\n\n=== END BH00066 ===\n\n=== START BH00067 ===\n\nHis Holiness Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors Rabi'u'th-Thani 1305\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord\n\nPraise and glory befit the Desired One of all worlds, Who conquered contingent beings with the sword of utterance and illumined the hearts of the people of the world with the light of knowledge, and through His heralds and messengers adorned the horizons of the world with unity and concord. He is the Omnipotent One Whom the polytheism of the polytheists and the protestations of the opposers did not veil His oneness, and did not prevent the sincere ones and near ones from turning to Him. Exalted be the signs of His sovereignty and the manifestations of His power and grandeur.\n\nGlorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose will the rivers of inner meanings have flowed in the gardens of utterance, and the hearts of the monotheists were attracted by what the Pen of Thy Cause spoke forth in the wonders of knowledge. The servant beareth witness to Thy unity and the singleness of Thy Being, and recognizeth that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken in the Kingdom of certitude, that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou didst send the Messengers and reveal the Books and made them bearers of glad tidings among Thy servants and acknowledgers of what Thou didst will for them through Thy generosity and favors, until the Manifestations culminated in Thy Most Great Manifestation and Thy Mighty Announcement. Then didst Thou reveal Thyself amongst Thy creation and called them to Thy most exalted horizon and Thy highest summit. Among the people are those whom their desires prevented from turning to Thee and their vain imaginings from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory, and among them are those who cut themselves from what the people possess, hastening to Thy good-pleasure, gazing toward the horizon of Thy Manifestation, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace, and anticipating what Thou didst promise them in Thy Books and Tablets. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the splendor of Thy countenance and by the lights of Thy days to assist whosoever desireth Thy mention and Thy praise and the triumph of Thy Cause with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all contingent things to aid him to exalt Thy Word and manifest that which Thou didst command the sincere ones in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the Omnipotent.\n\nThereafter, the letter of that beloved of hearts arrived like a bird from the paradise of love and affection and attraction. Its allusions were true glad tidings and its expressions were spiritual messages. Praise be to God, the fragrance of steadfastness and turning toward God and detachment in the path of service to the Lord of creation wafted and spread from it. It attracted the heart and perfumed the nostrils of the soul. His is the generosity and His is the grace. His favor hath encompassed and His bounty hath seized the hearts of those near unto Him, to such extent that they have passed beyond themselves and all else and have become attached to Him. They have sacrificed their spirits and bodies and limbs, all in the path of His Cause. After reading and understanding it, and experiencing joy and attraction, it was taken to the Presence and presented in its entirety before the countenance of the Lord of mankind, and these verses were revealed from the Creator of names and attributes. Thus speaketh the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing Expositor \\[...\\]\n\nThis is a Book which the Wronged One hath revealed for those who have quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Merciful, that the fragrances of revelation might attract them and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of the Most Great Throne and the Possessor of the Most Exalted Seat. Hearken once again unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree: He is, verily, none other than the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The ocean of utterance hath surged forth from the wellspring of thy Lord's Pen, the All-Merciful. Drink therefrom once from the cup of My loving-kindness, and again from the chalices of My mercy, and yet again from the handful of My hand. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. By God! Should anyone hear My call with the ear of innate nature, it would render him detached from all else save Me and cause him to cling to the cord of My loving-kindness, such that neither the swords of enemies nor the darts of the wicked would deter him. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken as a token of grace from God, the Creator of the heavens, that he might render thanks unto his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\n\nHe hath previously mentioned thee in verses before which the Books of the world and all that the nations possess have bowed down. To this beareth witness the Mother of Tablets from this radiant and luminous horizon. Say: O concourse of the Furqan! Fear ye the All-Merciful and oppose not Him through Whom every Cause and every perspicuous Book hath been established. And say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye God and dispute not with Him through Whom God's proof and His testimony have been made manifest, and through Whom the Bird of Knowledge hath warbled upon the loftiest branches. By God! The All-Merciful hath come with a supreme sovereignty that neither the powers of the world nor the might of nations can frustrate, nor can the dominion of those who have violated God's Covenant and Testament and denied the Day of Judgment cause Him fear.\n\nBe fair in judging this Revelation and its sovereignty, then consider that which hath been sent down in truth from the kingdom of His wondrous utterance. He is the One Who was promised in God's Books, of Whom the Primal Point gave glad tidings, and Who prostrated Himself at the mention of His name, saying: \"I am the first of His worshippers.\" O people of the Bayan! Observe and then recall when the Primal Point came, how the divines and doctors of the earth denied Him. Thus did their souls entice them in such wise as caused the Spirit of Holiness to lament in Paradise and the Faithful Spirit to grieve in this manifest Scene.\n\nWe beseech God to assist thee with the hosts of utterance and to enable thee to champion His Cause with a proof whose light hath shone forth from the dayspring of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remind God's party of My verses and glorify their faces on My behalf, then recite unto them that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will and the atmosphere of My Purpose, that their eyes may be solaced thereby and their hearts be gladdened. Verily, thy Lord loveth His loved ones. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this mighty and impregnable station.\n\nSay: O party of God! We counselled you aforetime and counsel you at this hour to be trustworthy and godly. By God's life! Through these shall your stations be exalted and your conditions be elevated. Hold fast unto them and be not of the heedless. Say: O people of Baha! Take what ye have been commanded by God, then act according to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath counselled you. This shall raise you up and draw you nigh unto the One, the Singular, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the Most Praiseworthy.\n\nThe glory that shineth resplendent and gleameth from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon them that love thee and hearken unto thy word in this wise Remembrance. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nO Son of Abhar! Upon thee be My glory! Warn the party of God concerning that which hath appeared. Should they ponder upon the former party and their deeds and actions on the Day of the Second Resurrection, they would not be afflicted with the vain imaginings of ignorant and heedless souls, and would behold themselves detached and free from all save God. The heedless souls have forgotten that which they witnessed with their own eyes, let alone matters wherein the birds of their hearts and minds are powerless to soar. They have seen with their own eyes the loss suffered by the Shi'ih party, yet now they have fallen again into imaginings a thousandfold greater than that party's vain fancies. Hadi of Dawlatabad hath become the people's leader and desired to dispatch the helpless servants to the abode of perdition and establish them in hell-fire. Say: O servants! Reflect upon that which hath appeared and is now witnessed, and upon that which hath passed and become concealed, that perchance through God's grace ye may gird up the loins of service for His sake alone. With utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the Self-Sufficing Lord that He may not again afflict His servants with vain imaginings as before. Glory be to God! What hath prevented their sight? What hath kept their ears from hearkening to the Word of Truth? The realms of knowledge and vision are astounded. O thou who soarest in My atmosphere! The existing ears and visible eyes were not and are not worthy to hear or fit to see, unless the grace of God, exalted be His glory, shall assist them and guide the heedless ones to the direction of awareness and awaken the slumberers from the sleep of negligence. These are the days of the appearance of the blessed verse wherein He hath said: \"They put their fingers in their ears lest they should hear the word of truth.\" For the sources of vain imaginings have forbidden their friends from drawing nigh unto the people of Baha. Glory be to God! They act as did the idolaters of old, yet perceive not that they utter the same words. The wrath of God hath seized them and the breezes of torment have encompassed them. Thus hath the matter been decreed as a recompense for their deeds. Verily, He is the most severe of avengers and the destroyer of transgressors. O beloved of my heart! For a long time the door was closed and no news came from thee. Praise be to God, the grace of God, exalted be His glory, appeared like a key and opened the doors of remembrance, utterance, presence and meeting. The fire of love became manifest and the primal flame appeared. The maidens of remembrance who were concealed in the chambers of inner meanings unveiled themselves and approached the gathering. I swear by the Sun of utterance of our Lord, the Most Merciful, that if the ears of the people of the world were sanctified, a single word of the supreme utterances that have shone forth from the Dayspring of the Will of the Lord of all beings would guide and suffice them all. In any case, one must ever supplicate the Lord of the intended goal for deliverance, and deliverance is the awakening of the servants and reflection upon that which hath appeared. In the nights and days this lowly servant, with manifest humility, beseecheth deliverance from the Lord of the Day of Judgment, for His mercy hath preceded and His grace hath encompassed all. Perchance He may again rend asunder the veils and coverings that eyes may not be debarred from beholding. With His bounty there is no place for despair. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. As to what thou didst write concerning the friends, upon them be the glory of God, after being submitted before His Most Holy, Most Exalted and Most Sacred Presence, there was revealed for each one that which would cause eternal mention and everlasting praise. This is what was revealed for his honor Khan Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the glory of God. These are His blessed and exalted words: He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon \\[...\\]\n\nVerily, We make mention of him who was named Muhammad before Baqir, that this remembrance may draw him to a station wherein nothing whatsoever shall deter him from this Cause, through which the limbs of all names have trembled. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken from the most exalted horizon. Blessed is he who hath turned toward My horizon, uttered My praise, and soared in My atmosphere. He is, before God, the Lord of the beginning and the end, among the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise. Drink thou of My sealed wine in My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and say: O concourse of the world! By God, the Ancient King hath come with a sovereignty before which all parties are powerless. He hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. Say: O people! Cast aside what ye possess and take hold of that which ye are commanded by God, the Lord of all men. This is the Day whereon all things cry out with their loudest voice: The Promised One hath come from the heaven of grace with the banners of glory and power. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this bounty through which the ocean of utterance hath surged in the contingent world and the rain of forgiveness hath showered upon those who have clung to the cord of their Lord's grace, the Lord of creation. The glory be upon thee from the Wronged One, and upon those who have turned toward the Supreme Horizon on a Day wherein the Caller hath called out: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Karbila'i 'Abbas, upon him be the glory of God:\n\nHe is the Speaker among the servants\n\nO 'Abbas! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of His Most Great Prison. Verily, it draweth thee nigh unto God, the Lord of mankind. He hath come for the salvation of the world, yet the peoples have turned away from Him and committed that which hath caused the mountains to crumble. They have cast the Command of God behind their backs and taken their vain imaginings as lords beside God, the Dayspring of Lights. Among the people are those who have denied God's Cause, those who have turned away, and those who have objected and committed that which hath caused the Supreme Pen to lament at morn and eve. Blessed is the servant who hath heard My call and attained unto the traces of My Pen, and woe unto every heedless doubter. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon My loved ones who have acted in accordance with that which they were commanded in the Mother Book. Say:\n\nMy God, my God! I testify that Thou hast remembered me, and from Thy Most Exalted Horizon Thou hast turned toward this servant of Thine and revealed unto him from the Pen of Thy bounty that whose fragrance hath diffused among Thy servants. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of the Sun of Thy Revelation in Thy days and the manifestations of its power amidst Thy creation, to ordain for me that which shall protect me from those who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs. Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of grace hath surged and the fragrance of bounty hath wafted between earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for his honor Karbila'i Ya'qub, upon him be the glory of God:\n\nIn My Name, through which the heaven of idle fancies was cleft asunder\n\nO Ya'qub! Give thanks for that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in a manner that no mention can equal. Thy name was present before the Countenance, and We have mentioned thee in such wise that through it the realities of all things were attracted and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the highest branches. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the chalice of bounty and My call hath drawn thee to the Supreme Horizon, say: \\[...\\]\n\nO my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having adorned me with the ornament of Thy remembrance. I beseech Thee by the breezes which have blown by Thy will, and by the light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy purpose, and by the ocean of Thy signs and the heaven of Thy manifestation, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy service. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O my God, bestow Thy blessings upon those who have held fast to the cord of Thy bounty and have attained unto the recognition of that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, and who have aided Thy Cause throughout the nights and days. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mankind. There is none other God but Thee, the Sovereign over all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nThis was revealed for Ustad Isma'il, upon him be the glory of God.\n\nIn the name of the Goal of all the worlds!\n\nO Isma'il! The time hath come, the moment is at hand, the Hour is present, the Resurrection hath appeared, the mysteries are unveiled, the verses are revealed, and the evidences are manifest. Yet the servants are all heedless, in denial and turned away, save whom thy Lord willeth. This is that same News which was mentioned in the Qur'an as the Great News, which had ever been hidden and concealed in the hearts of the pure ones, and recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures. Nevertheless, the people remain veiled and deprived. The vain imaginings of the heedless souls have prevented them from the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness. In truth, the worthless straws of the world were not and are not worthy of the court of God, exalted be His glory. Beseech God to raise up such servants as befit these days, that they may behold that which hath shone forth and become manifest, and may hear that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of their Lord, the Speaker, the All-Knowing.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest how thirst hath destroyed Thy servants. Where is the Salsabil of Thy grace and the Kawthar of Thy mercy? Where is the Euphrates of Thy bounty and the choice wine of Thy utterance? Hunger hath seized them from every side. Where is the heavenly table of Thy bestowal and the blessing of Thy knowledge? The fire of longing and separation hath consumed them. Where is Thy presence and Thy meeting, and the manifestation of Thy favors? I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and Thy call amongst Thy servants, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which shall protect them from the evil of Thine enemies and provide them with the fruits of the tree of Thy nearness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThe Sun of bounty, praise be to God, hath shone upon all, and each of the names hath attained, through the grace and bounty of the Lord of Names. The servant beseecheth his Lord to make them as ensigns among His servants and as standards in His lands, that through them His mention and His praise, His commandments and His laws may be exalted. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nAnd regarding the mention made of the honored sisters, the greater and the lesser, and the honored and revered mother, upon her be the glory of God, after being presented before the Most Exalted Horizon, there was revealed specifically for each that which is everlasting and eternal. The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nIn the name of the One God \\[...\\]\n\nToday from the cloud of divine mercy in the realm of inner meanings, fresh and wondrous flowers have appeared and blossomed, and each has its own remembrance, utterance and discourse. Blessed are they who hear and observe. O my leaf and my handmaiden! Although the people of the world have eyes and ears, they are deprived of seeing and hearing. After their pleadings, lamentations, mourning, seeking and hopes, they ultimately did what no idolater had ever done and said what no oppressor had ever said. In word they were the most excellent and exalted in the world, but in deed they were the most lost and base of all peoples. How good is the state of one who observes affairs with justice and fairness and seeks divine confirmation. The realm of knowledge is bewildered and astounded, for the divines of Iran, despite their supplications and lamentations, openly curse the Goal of all the worlds from their pulpits. Give thanks unto God that He has assisted thee in such an age and guided thee to the Egypt of awareness, despite those who have adorned themselves with turbans and prevented people from the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Take thou the choice wine of My utterance in My name, then drink of it in remembrance of My wondrous Name. Praise be to God that thou hast attained the mention of the One Beloved and art adorned with His love and illumined with the light of His knowledge. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land and illumine them with the lights of the Sun of the bounty of God, exalted be His glory.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for another sister, Fatimeh, upon her be the Glory of God:\n\nIn the name of the Goal of all worlds:\n\nO my leaf, upon thee be My glory! Thy mention was made before the Wronged One, and these verses were sent down from the heaven of the will of the Self-Subsisting Lord that the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful might attract thee and draw thee to the horizon of knowledge. The world was brought from nothingness into being for the knowledge of God. Blessed is the heart that hath turned toward the divine horizon and the face that hath been illumined by the lights of the Countenance in the divine days. Praise the Goal of all worlds that thou hast drunk from the hands of bounty the Kawthar of meeting, and this Kawthar is, in the first degree and station, the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, which hath been recorded by the Pen of Will in the Holy Books and Tablets. We beseech God to cause the handmaidens of that land to attain unto this supreme gift and not to deprive any from the fruits of the Tree and the lights of the Luminary of the horizon of inner meanings. In all conditions God hath been with thee. Verily He is with His devoted male and female servants. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nSay: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the leaves and fruits of the Tree of Thy Cause, and by the Word through which the earth and all created things therein were illumined, to ordain for me that which shall be a light before my face and a companion to me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Thou knowest what is in my heart and what I desire of the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to make me content with what Thou hast ordained for me through Thy will and purpose. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Supreme, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. There is no God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed from the heaven of bounty for you another time, He, exalted be He, says: \\[...\\]\n\nO Son of Abhar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny! We testify that thou hast attained unto the tokens of Our Pen and unto that which the Tongue of Grace hath spoken from that Station named the Most Great Prison in the Book of God, Lord of the worlds. We have previously mentioned thy father in words from which the sweet savors of utterance were wafted throughout creation. He who possesseth a clear Book beareth witness to this. He ascended unto God with a heart before which the hearts of those who have turned towards Him became submissive. By My life! The Concourse on High welcomed him at his ascension, and this grace admitted him to a station which the tongues of those who remember are powerless to describe. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon him and upon thee and upon thy mother who hath attained unto the verses of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nGrace hath encompassed, Light hath shone forth, loving-kindness hath encompassed all, and mercy hath preceded all. Glory be to God! Bounty and generosity have reached such a station that they have become sanctified above all mention, description, explanation and elaboration. All the bounties of the world cannot be compared to a drop from the ocean of His bestowals. Powerlessness is the state of the servant, and in truth he is powerless. This utterance is not from false modesty. Suppose one imagines a star - what station would or could that star have compared to the shining suns, the brilliant moons, and the countless stars? In any case, we beseech the Exalted Truth to adorn the world with the ornament of awareness and to bestow the true Kawthar, that it might become worthy of His threshold and deserving of His court. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nAs for the mention of Jinab-i-Dhabih, upon him be the Glory of God, after it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words and decisive verses were revealed from the heaven of grace. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\n\"I am the Rememberer and I am the Remembered.\n\nThe Wronged One, Who hath been imprisoned for having summoned all to God, the Lord of the worlds, remembereth thee. Verily He hath appeared and manifested what He desired as a grace from His presence, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The might of any oppressor did not deter Him, nor did the power of any transgressor frighten Him, nor did the strength of any suspicious commander weaken Him. Glorified be He Who hath manifested what was hidden and hath spoken what He desired while seated upon His mighty throne.\"\n\nPraise be to the Lord of eternity Who hath freed and delivered. By the Luminary of utterance which shineth and appeareth from the horizon of the heaven of proof, imprisonment in His path is the cause and means of freedom for the people of creation, weakness in His love is the cause of strength, and tribulation in His path is the sovereign of glory. Outwardly it is hardship, inwardly it is bounty and mercy. Blessed is he who hath attained unto tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all beings and the Possessor of Names.\n\nO Ismail! The life of the world and its days vanish and become non-existent in but a moment. Blessed is the soul that in this transient abode hath acquired that which endureth, and in the house of toil hath obtained eternal rest. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist thee and His loved ones there to be steadfast. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones among Thy enemies, and the choicest of Thy servants beneath the most wicked of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by Thy might and Thy sovereignty to protect them through Thy power and to exalt them through Thy exaltation. I bear witness, O my God, to that which the Tongue of Thy Grandeur hath testified and which was revealed in Thy Book, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Rasul-i-Qannad, upon him be the Glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.\n\nO Messenger of God! Praise be that thou hast drunk from the choice wine of utterance and been sustained by the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Thy heart is illumined by the light of recognition, thy tongue uttereth praise and thanksgiving, and thy countenance is turned toward the effulgent Face. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath mentioned thee. The Truth is present in your gathering and He heareth and seeth; naught escapeth His knowledge. Each of those souls gathered hath succeeded in mentioning God and is adorned with the verses of the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the land whereon My loved ones have gathered, and blessed the house honored by their footsteps wherein their remembrances are raised. Today the Sun of true unity is rising from the horizon of the heaven of grace. We beseech God to illumine all through its rays. He is the Hearer, the Answerer, the Bestower, the Merciful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for His Honor Aqa Siyyid Hamzih, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the All-Knowing Expositor\n\nO thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Hearken unto the call of the Prisoner. This is that Call which guided the Interlocutor to the horizon of nearness and reunion, and led Him to the most exalted station and the highest rank. Blessed is the soul that today holdeth fast to the blessed word \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth,\" for this word is the king of words. Whosoever drinketh from the hidden ocean therein findeth himself seated upon the throne of certitude and assurance. We beseech God to grant His servants success and deprive them not of His eternal bounty. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. O Siyyid Hamzih! The light of oneness hath in this moment cast its radiance. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me, made me know Thee, and mentioned me. I testify that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for His Honor Haji Fat?-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Subduing above all Names\n\nO Fat?-'Ali! When thou hearest My call and attainest the honor of hearkening unto My verses, say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou hast aided me to turn toward Thee and to face the light of Thy countenance on a Day wherein the limbs of Thy servants trembled from fear of Thee, and Thou hast guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name at whose revelation from the kingdom of Thine utterance all names bowed down before it, and by Thy Command which hath encompassed earth and heaven, to make me in all conditions circle round Thy will and hold fast unto Thy decree. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Hope and my Desire, for having shown me Thy horizon, made me hear Thy call, and revealed unto me that which was hidden from Thy creation. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love in such wise that all things shall not hinder me from turning toward Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for His Honor Rasul, upon him be the Glory of God. The Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:\n\nHe is the Compassionate, the Generous \\[...\\]\n\nO Messenger! The Wronged One hath made mention of thee before in such wise as to attract the hearts of them that are nigh. There hath befallen thee in My path what none can reckon save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto this Cause when it shone forth and appeared from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Behold, then remember when the oppressors cast this Wronged One into the Most Great Prison for having given the world glad tidings of the Most Great Name, whereby the backs of the wicked were broken and the tears of the idolaters did flow. They denied the Manifestation of God and His proof, and committed that which caused them that are nigh to lament. The oppressor lamented when the Sun of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of grace, and Justice wept by reason of what befell the Wronged One at the hands of them that violated the Covenant of God, the Mighty, the Great. Blessed art thou for having borne tribulations in the path of God, the Goal of them that know. Thus did the Pen speak when the Wronged One was in evident sorrow. We beseech God to assist thee and them that have believed to exalt His Word amongst His servants. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon every one who hath turned unto Him and whom the might of the aggressors hath not deterred.\n\nThis was revealed for Haji Iman, upon him be the glory of God:\n\nIn My Name which shineth forth from the horizon of the will of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nO Iman! Thou didst hear the call and didst believe, and thou didst behold the Most Exalted Horizon. All this is from God's grace upon thee. At this manifest time, the letter of Ibn-i-Abhar which he had sent to the servant present before the Greatest Scene was read before the Countenance. He made mention of thee, therefore We make mention of thee and illumine thee with the lights of utterance of the Lord of all possibility. Give praise to the Lord of the Day that He confirmed thee and granted thee steadfastness. Thou didst preserve God's covenant and His testament, and remained protected from the doubts of the croakers and the hints of the transgressors. He verily is the All-Bountiful, and He is the Generous. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Convey to the relatives of Ashraf, upon him be the glory of God, the greetings of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, they have attained unto that which most of the people of the earth are deprived of. Their mention hath ever been and still is in the presence of the Wronged One. Blessed are they and woe unto the oppressors. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nThis was revealed for Muhammad-Quli, upon him be the glory of God:\n\nIn the name of the Goal of the world.\n\nO Muhammad-Quli! The fragrance of the Divine Manifestation is diffused throughout the world and the Mother Book speaketh before the faces of friends and foes on the Day of Return. The sealed Wine is manifest, the River is flowing, the Ocean of bounty is surging. Blessed are those souls whom doubts and allusions prevented not from the Revealer of verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs. With complete steadfastness they arose to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings, and with wisdom and utterance opened the doors of hearts. These are the Divine emissaries and the dawning-places of the mention of the eternal Goal. Today the atoms of creation are stirred with joy at reunion with the Peerless Friend; they move by His mention and rejoice in His Name. For each thing there exists a spirit befitting it. His grace can make living water to flow from lifeless rock. Even the staff of Moses had both eyes and spirit. Beseech God that He may attract the frozen, weighty souls through the breezes of the Day of Manifestation and guide them to the horizon of His knowledge. His is the praise and favor that He created thee, made thee aware, and granted thee a portion from the sea of knowledge. He is the All-Bountiful and He is the Generous.\n\nAnd this was revealed for Jinab-i-Sabz-'Ali - He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon \\[...\\]\n\nPraise be to God! Thou hast heard the Call and beheld the Most Great Ocean and its waves. His Call hath attracted hearts and souls, and His Will hath enabled those near and sincere to attain unto the Dawning-Place of utterance and the Day-Spring of knowledge. Every fair-minded one beareth witness and every just one is aware that this Wronged One hath not been remiss in proclaiming the Divine Cause. In the nights and days the scratching of His Pen was raised and His Call was manifest from the highest horizon of the world. No affair, no thing, no event could prevent Him from His purpose. Yet they who are endowed with hearing and sight are few. Beseech God that He may graciously aid all to achieve that which is conducive to the betterment of the world and the tranquility of its peoples.\n\nWe counsel all the loved ones in that land and other regions to fear God. This temple of existence it preserveth from the arrows of the dawning-places of idle fancies and the manifestations of Satan. It is a crown for the head, a suit of armor for the body, and a light for the heart. Blessed is the soul that hath clung unto it and held fast to that which God hath willed. We beseech God to grant thee success, that thou mayest arise with complete steadfastness and be occupied with the remembrance of the Peerless Friend. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThis is what hath been revealed for His Honor Naqd-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:\n\nHe is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Praise beseemeth the One Beloved Who, through the choice wine of utterance, hath attracted all who are in the realm of possibility and guided them to the horizon of the heaven of the Prison. The cawing of the ravens did not deter Him. Every day a Book is revealed and a Scripture made manifest. By the life of God! The Kingdom of utterance is stirred by His utterance and the world of existence exists through His bounty. Nevertheless, the people remain veiled, nay, as though non-existent. O Naqd-'Ali! God willing, mayest thou be a spiritual coin in the city of true money-changers. Praise be to God, thou didst hear and turn unto Him, and thy turning hath brought thee to such a station that the Wronged One of the world, at the close in the Most Great Prison, mentioned thy name and sealed with thy name. His is the bounty and the giving, His the grace and the glory. We beseech God to aid and assist thee in all conditions to that wherein lieth His good-pleasure. We make mention of all the servants and handmaidens and say \"Allah-u-Abha.\" His grace hath encompassed all and His mercy hath preceded all. Blessed are they who know and blessed are they who have attained.\n\nWhat tongue is capable of praise and what utterance befitteth the description of this station? One wave from the ocean of His utterance quickeneth the world, and one ray from the Sun of His grace draweth the peoples to the most exalted horizon. His grace and bounty, His tenderness and mercy have reached such a degree that all acknowledge their inability to comprehend. The people are heedless and veiled while the Truth is manifest and evident. A hundred thousand regrets for these servants who in such days are occupied with themselves and are heedless of Him. The deniers are immersed in the ocean of vain imaginings; despite the appearance and manifestation of the Sun of Truth, all are observed to be heedless.\n\nO beloved of my heart! Praise be to God that they entered the prison and witnessed that which is hidden from the world, and likewise the gathering of souls who circle round about. There has never been any doubt that this assembly is harmful to His blessed person, for governments have never concerned themselves with religion, but they fear gatherings and are antagonistic to their Source and Origin. Nevertheless, He has paid no heed and has not deprived the friends of meeting and attaining His presence for the sake of His own comfort. One soul on the island associated with an imaginary person - now ask him under oath to recount what he saw and what transpired in that land. O beloved of my heart! This ephemeral one was with him for years - twenty years have passed and until now not a soul remains in that land; he even sent away his own children and dismissed them. If that beloved one were to meet the person who went there and resided in that land, and question him, many matters would become evident and clear, but only if he speaks truthfully. In any case, this servant conveys greetings to all the friends and masters, and beseeches the Most Great Victory for all. Verily our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, is the All-Seeing Witness, the Speaker, the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nRegarding what was written about Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory of God - in truth it is exactly as that beloved one has written. They are ablaze with the fire of divine remembrance. It is hoped that through God's grace - exalted be His glory - this fire will encompass all and draw the heedless people to the horizon of wisdom. After being submitted before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, this blessed Tablet, from whose horizon the light of favor shines forth and rises, was specifically revealed for him, that he might drink from its oceans of inner meanings and utterance. The Command is in the hand of God, our Lord, the Most Merciful. His blessed and exalted Word:\n\nHe is the One Who stands before the faces of the world \\[...\\]\n\nO Husayn, upon thee be my Baha! Praise be to God, thou hast been and art remembered in the Most Holy Court, and art the recipient of His special favors. Strive that perchance through wisdom and utterance the people of the world may turn to the horizon of the All-Merciful and deliver themselves from heedlessness, abasement, poverty and imprisonment. The Cause of God hath been manifested in such wise that even decayed bones have stirred, yet the people of the turbans - the opposing souls - remain unto this time frozen and cast out, neither awakening to consciousness through the divine trumpets nor rousing from their slumber of heedlessness through the cry. The Sun of Truth shineth resplendent above all heads, yet they see it not nor perceive it. The ocean of utterance surgeth in the pole of contingent being, yet acceptance is nowhere to be found. They run through streets and bazaars in pursuit of a single dirham of raisins, yet remain heedless and veiled from the pearls and jewels of wisdom and utterance that have appeared from the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen. Glory be to God! The company of divines and rulers have not yet awakened. Say: By God's life! Between throne and dust there is but a single point of difference. Where is the throne of Chosroes? Whither went Caesar? What became of the Pharaohs? Where established themselves the tyrants? Have they not seen the book of the world? Have they not read it? Have they not heard the cries that are raised therefrom at all times? Nay, by God! Every soul hath heard the call \"The departure!\" and witnessed with his own eyes the changes and transformations. Where are the fathers? Whither went the mothers? In brief, the colors of the world have deprived all from the purpose of the worlds. They are occupied with it and heedless of the Truth; they cling to it and are debarred from the Truth.\n\nO Husayn, upon thee be my Baha! Praise be to God, thou art assisted in promoting His Cause and adorned with His grace. We beseech God to aid and assist thee at all times, that there may appear from thee in utterance that which attracteth hearts, in steadfastness that which causeth mountains to tremble, and in conduct that which amazeth creation. Under all conditions counsel the loved ones with wisdom and utterance, and remind them of whatsoever conduceth to the exaltation of God's Word. Convey to the servants and handmaidens of that land the greetings of the Wronged One. Say: Be not sorrowful, for ye are the people of the blessed and hallowed land. Recite these words every morning:\n\nO God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! This is a land reddened with the blood of Thy loved ones who fulfilled Thy Covenant and Testament, whom neither the might of the Pharaohs nor the power of the tyrants deterred. We beseech Thee by the Most Exalted One Who acknowledged Thy unity and oneness in the earliest days, who quaffed Thy sealed wine through Thy name, the Self-Subsisting, and arose to celebrate Thy praise and glory in such wise that neither the clamor of the divines nor the harm of the jurisprudents prevented Him until He sacrificed His spirit in Thy path - we beseech Thee by Him and by those who supported and manifested Him to aid us to be steadfast in Thy love and to arise to serve Thee and to act according to what Thou hast commanded us in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nToday you must arise to serve the Cause, detached from all else in the world, and through wisdom, utterance, spirit and sweet fragrance draw souls to the Divine realm. Everyone has been waiting - beseech ye the True One to unite the world through loving counsels and wise exhortations. All these different parties are seekers of truth, but they have lost their way. Teaching must be done with kindliness - they are children needing education, ignorant ones seeking knowledge. The educators and teachers are and have been the chosen ones of God - they are the wise ones of the earth. They must act with wisdom and deliver the people from the abyss of error. We have accepted all the afflictions of the earth for the tranquility of the servants - such tribulations were visited upon the Wronged One that caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to weep and lament. Glory be to God! Yet no one has become aware. Each day heedlessness increases and mindfulness diminishes. We beseech God that through the Kawthar of His chosen ones' utterance, the saplings planted in the garden of acceptance may flourish and bear fruit. Blessed are those souls whom the might of the world has not prevented from turning to Him nor held back from acceptance - they have grasped the cord of wisdom and clung to the luminous hem.\n\nSay: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy most sweet call, by Thy standing before the faces of the enemies, by Thy finger wherewith Thou didst rend asunder the veils and the mists, and by Thy command whereby Thou didst subdue all regions, to strengthen me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee with wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Lord of the world and the Desire of the nations. The power of creation cannot withhold Thee, nor can the might of possibilities prevent Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy command. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones and chosen ones in the hands of those who have denied Thy proof, Thy testimony and Thy signs. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, Thy traces and Thy mysteries to protect them from the evil of Thine enemies. O Lord! Deliver them through Thy power, might, grandeur and sovereignty. Then aid them to perform deeds whereby their stations may be exalted among Thy servants. Thou art He through Whose name the Kawthar of life flowed from Thy Pen and the Euphrates of mercy and bounty through Thy will and pleasure. I beseech Thee to ordain for us that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and benefit us in all Thy worlds. Thou knowest what we have and we know not what Thou hast. Verily Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.\n\nWe ask and beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to reveal that which is hidden and treasured in the repositories of His words, that all may inhale the sweet fragrances of the utterance of the All-Merciful and turn from all created things unto that which is with God. Soon will the signs and evidences rend asunder the veils of the people, that all may attain unto and be illumined by the splendors of the light of the Sun of Revelation. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory and praise and remembrance be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\n===
